Blog, blog, blog. More blogging. I plotted two really nice maps of the Big Island - prepping for the trip next month. I can't wait to be back on the volcano and also on the beaches. I'm looking forward to some relaxation time... I'll give Noah and Amanda a copy for their wedding present and put the other on my wall to peruse 'til trip time. Also need to get Laura's email address. I've emailed her twice in the last month or two, but no response. She probably switched emails and the one I have for her is out of date. I also want to get webcams: one each for her, my Yawski, and me so that we can see each other and the girls can see them with video email...
Met w/ a friend today - good man that Jimmy the C... Been checking on faster web access and think I'll upgrade to wireless broadband. Also have a couple of interesting GIS projects working. Will have to see how they play out. Want to work on the playground for the girls - teeka teeka...will price out some lumber tomorrow. A good day but for one comment by the ex... More later...
Just blogging along, waiting for the girls to awaken. They're both so cute as they sleep, gathering energy for the day. Yesterday we went to the carnival - lots of fun rides, stuffed animals, snow cones, chicken tacos, and sunshine. The carnis were another sight to reminisce on. Those carnivals that blew through Salinas when I was a kid had some questionable characters working the sidelines. Yesterday one ride operator offered me 20 tickets for $10, but "don't tell anyone, ok?"... Trying to scam a buck for his habit, I suppose. Another young kid offered to give us free rides if we came back later. He said he just appreciated us listening to him tell his story about getting in a fight with a Mexican while we rode the ride. Apparently he had hurt his leg and needed some attention. His coworkers were just a bunch of "druggies and users" and were "very immature for their ages". I understand... Time to sign off and surf up on some foundation info...the web is great!
I have my daughers for the next few days. Time to play with them and see what new things we can discover. I love them both. More later...
Time to go in and have my health assessed. Hopefully all the stress and changes over the past year haven't done me too much harm... I'm thankful to be able to have the time and resources to be checked out. My blood pressure keeps staying around borderline... I need to get back to a regular workout schedule...
Today nothing special - just rooting for those Cocks to win. They have a tough row to hoe against Cal State Fullerton. GO COCKS!
Still fighting this bronchitis - NOT fun... Wavering about next week's trip with Buck. Will try to call him and cancel due to Dr.'s orders. Will have to find gold some other time... Will also play around with more webcam stuff - time to price out a computer for home. Maybe should wait 'til fall and see what my budget looks like for technology. Should also get my tax paperwork organized so that next my NAGT stuff isn't hard to do next spring. Filing, filing, filing... Will also read more Kohn to help with parenting challenges... Signing off... Oh yeah, one more thing, need to get Laura's email address; try to set her up with webcam capabilities... hasta luigi
Just some more thoughts rambling through my head... I listened to a spiel on npr about blogging today that said the best sites are run/maintained by bloggers with a distinct "voice" - something opinionated on their minds. Ok, my opinion of the day is that my government is the worst I've seen it during my lifetime and I'm really hoping for a change this fall. My policies are better than our leaders' and I'm a flippin' GEOLOGIST! I'm thoroughly disgusted by the current administration. I think they're greedy, self-serving, insular frat boys - the foxes got into the chicken coop and are feasting with little dispute from anyone outside. More soon...
This single fatherhood stuff is really hard sometimes! Yesterday I felt really angry. No time to myself sometimes... Yet, this, too, shall pass... It's worth the investment now to have good relationships with the girls later - gotta toe the line...
I'm listening to Gamecock Baseball - CWS 2004. Manana is Vaterstag - got to get pop something...
Blogging along - trying to stay balanced. Been fighting this darned bronchitis for over a week - getting sick of it (figuratively and literally). Time to run some errands and see if this blogpost works. Wondering what else I can use this for...
I'm trying to post another message to my blog, but seem to be having trouble... Testing again...
I'm just testing this blog post out to see what it looks like on my blog site. I'm trying to learn how to publish, retrieve, organize, etc. What about posting images to my blog? I tried the "Hello" software, but it wasn't exactly what I was interested in.
Just finished 4 days at Baker Station - what a great trip! Good group, good geology/biology, good times... Met up with Cathy Busby and the UCSB/Sacramento Volcanology Group on the trip - serendipity works its magic again. Will call Erik today to link up tomorrow. Also need to get Bixur boy today and make a To Do list. Mas spater...
Time for another blog checkin.Why aren't there spaces between sentences in the blogs I've been posting? I'll double space, like I usually do, and when it's posted, they're gone. Oh well, another one of life's little blog mysteries... I'm excited about the trip this upcoming weekend with Ross. I don't have a whole lot of prep to do, which is nice. It'll be great to get up to the high country as well as out to the desert for a couple of days. I really need to get over to Nevada to plan a portion of the Tahoe trip out, too. I'll look at my calendar... Time to jet - more blogging later when I have more zeit...
I've been sick. There's nothing more depressing to me than being sick or having some sort of health problem. This is my summer for urlLink %$##@'s sake! Since the girls have been in pre-school I've taken it on the immune system chin. They come home with every ailment imaginable and I'm the unlucky recipient of each and every virus lately. What the heck IS a virus anyway? And what's the purpose of one? They're not actually alive - they just replicate and screw you up!What's the point of that? I'm not very happy about their existence... My health's on the mend (knock on wood) 'til the next round at the pre-school. Time to get back into the gym and build up some resistence. Later.
I finally have a fast broadband connection - pretty blogdamn fast! Now I'll try the webcam thing will Bill and see if I can't get them up and running and working with Yawski and Lala... Got the girlies so can't blog long. Hasta luigi.
Bloggystyle - my favorite... Just think, if the government spent the $192 billion on domestic problems rather than Iraq how the country would be different. More jobs for people in the U.S. More money for infrastructure - roads and transportation, energy systems, forests, rivers, etc., etc. What a bunch of crooks we've elected. Their kids' futures seem fine, don't they?
Happy d-day blogging everyone...
Yesterday was 'bitchin' - I could see the fireworks in Sacramento, Manteca, Tracy, Modesto, Turlock, and Merced - maybe even Los Banos, all from my porch! I had heard from some others on the hill that they had seen it all, but to observe firsthand was killer. I'm still amazed at the view sometimes... It was worth the stress of housebuilding, splitting up, etc., to keep the place. I love it! I had the girls and they were more impressed with the fireworks (and my reactions to them) the night before in Murphys. They were surely big enough for them to see and for CJ to understand. TK saw and only comprehended on a certain scale...but she did see it and watched for the whole duration. She's changing and understanding more and more each week. It's so interesting to me. CJ is also developing physically, intellectually, emotionally, etc. She's a gem. Time to work on their playground/swing...
Checking in for today's blog. I have a list of things that keeps growing and shrinking at the same time. Pop says my list'll always have at least six things on it... He also says write things on my list down at night so they don't bounce around in my head while I sleep... Good advice. I need to call Laura today and check in with her - it's been too long since I've spoken with her. My daughters need her to see them...they need their cousin. I also need to set up some literacy centers in the house for CJ and TK. I'll go by Staples and see what I can come up with. I'll put some paper around the toy room and start converting it to a scribbling center to promote their growing literacy. They can also draw and scribble on the back of the plans for the garage - good use of the poster-sized paper. I'll look into getting some markers that wipe off of walls...
Time for another bloggie check in. More folks retiring from work here - this year will be really interesting with all of the changes. Next year will be, too, with all the new hirees... I hope the girls make it home ok - their mom is getting a late start and she was dreading the flight(s) across the country. Time to go to town and get ready for their arrival - shopping, cleaning, napping, etc.
Another ho hum entry into my blog. I'm working out some field trip issues, planning for 4 days in and around Tahoe. It should be fun. I'll try to head out later this afternoon or evening to recon for tomorrow. Maybe I'll shine it on and wing it. I'm feeling so unmotivated right now... C'est la vie, eh? Nothing like procrastinating to build enough stress to then actually get things done! Mas spater...
Home from Hawaii and I'm catching up with all the chores. I'm off to do some field recon for the Tahoe/Nevada trip. I'll round up some road logs and see what I can come up with. I'd like to get in some hiking for a couple of the days to get some exercise in while on the trip. It took a day to recover from jet lag coming home. I took the red eye back and got in to SF at 5:01 am, then had to drive 2.5 hours to get home to Cola. I slept a lot yesterday! I miss CJ and TK! I also called to check on BixurBoy and he's doing fine - in good hands with Kathy and Mike. They love him. I bought CJ and TK some T-shirts and boxes of the best candy on the planet from the famous Hilo Candy Factory. I remember going there while visiting MaryAnn. It'll be good to see the girls again.
Another volcano blog entry. Did a heli flight over Pu'u O'o and Kupaianaha vents, the latter being fully obscured by subsequent flows, the former showing activity and recent flows still slowly running downslope. What a thrill to fly over and check it out up so close. Hopefully the video footage will turn out. The conference starts this evening, I think. No real good description of when and where we're supposed to meet! If I ever put on a conference, I'll try to be more on top of things than these folks are...I imagine it'd be hard, though, to think of everything. I miss CJ and TK and hope they're feeing better in Maine; they've been sick the past couple of days. Das ist alle.
I'm on the volcano w/out a car - long story short = expired license/no rente... The humidity and tropical island flavor is great to experience once again. I'm feeling ambivalent, but mostly taking in the slower pace forced upon me and enjoying the pool, beach, downtown, museums, cafes, etc. I'm hoping to link up with some of the conference participants tomorrow or the next day and cut out early to get some things done back home. It'll work out. I might try to do a helicopter ride tomorrow if I can get a reservation. I'll call later and see what the chances are. That would be pretty cool - the weather's supposed to hold since tropical storm Darby blew through late yesterday. Bye, bye bruddah! (The pigeon english on the bus ride was interesting to me...).

i don't know about anyone else's crushin' style, but mine usually involves several hotties of the male gender, sometimes a female, that i work with...and it's just because i'm around them all the time...you can't help it, i even read that there is some horomone or something that people secrete that being in it's presence (through close and/or frequent contact) makes you happier, thus feeling better about yourself, thus you begin to ponder the idea of a fling or even a full blown relationship. that's the science behind it anyway. i try to keep, as a friend would say, my assets spread out--lots of mini, non-serious crushes. but this time, one got away...it took off in a dead sprint and before i knew it, i had a full-blown, yearnin' n' pinin' crush on my co-worker. i know it won't behoove me any and so tried to convince myself i didn't like him just to protect myself from the inevitable rejection--it sure helped when i noticed his burnin' flame for some other chick (the derogatory sense implied here please). that tingly-ache still fizzles in my chest everytime i see him hug her so sweetly though and so i know it's not over, i'll just have to keep building that bridge until i'm far enough on the otherside to burn it...
i know all the business about optimism saving and lengthening your life...blah, blah, blah...but sometimes i just have a down day. used to be i could turn that day into weeks and months, but alas, i'm changing my ways, i'm adopting a new outlook. those one day things are a bitch though. i just can't help getting sucked into the black hole that is missing someone. especially those someones that have died, there is no cure for that lonliness. you think maybe alcohol or painkillers could fill the void, but they seem to just acidically eat away the edges making it so much bigger. so how are you supposed to deal with missing people or things or intimacy, because really, that's where a lot of bad habits stem from. that's the reason i still call my ex-boyfriend and say things like "i don't care about any of the stuff that happened between us because i still love you no matter what!!!" while that may be true, there were a lot of serious reasons for us breaking up and logic says it won't work out. it's just that logic isn't always in accordance with our feelings and i'd like to say not only does that suck, but it's also confusing as hell! and so i wonder is life a competition to fake it? in the end, if you can be happy with all the shit that happens (and it happens to EVERYBODY) is that the meaning...the purpose? if it is, maybe i should go looking for trouble and fudge my way through it with a big ol' grin. then of course, i'm afraid murphy's law would kick in and i wouldn't be able to find trouble if i was riding in it. and so it goes that i'm going to stick up my chin, and grin, and sing...as long as life is still in the making, it's still sweet.
Just got to say today sucked. My friends were a total let down. Ok thatz all I wanted to say. Bye.
Hey yall! Its really early here and I should be asleep but I'm just a bit wired up. I just got back from my friend Anges house. We had a blast. Well let me backtrack. I don't really remember Tuesday, I think I just chilled and stuff. Well since today is technically Thursday all this stuff that went on happened yesterday. So anyway I went to summer school like always. I was late but nothing I could about it. Came home and chilled for a while. I wanted to go to sleep but I got distracted and I didn't want to mess up my hair if I was to go down to Shoprite and hand in my application. So I was chilling and my friend Ange calls. I had called her the night before but she didn't get back to me till today but I had already gotten things straightened out. So she came online and we was talking and she was like u wanna come hang but she had to go to church @ 7 and then we would go back to her house. First I had to go drop off my application and it wasn't as bad as I thought. The lady took my application and she seemed nice so we'll see what happens. Well then I went over my friends and I helped her cook supper (lol) her ma was at work and her dad was mowing so she was making dinner blah blah anyways. After that we went to her church. They have Wednesday night mass. It was ok I was just really tired cause I only got like 4 hours of sleep from the night before so I was almost falling asleep. :X After that a bunch of us was hanging out in the parking lot. It looked like we were gonna get a really bad storm but we ended up not getting much at all. So we hung out there for a while, it was pretty cool. The guys are really funny so we were all joking around with each other and stuff. So then we went back to Anges (stopping for ice cream first) and Ange Allison and me hung out. We were cracking up. We created a slide show bout this guy from the church. It is totally not to be bashing him at all, we think hes awesome, but we were just fooling around. So I didn't leave till like 12:15 (this is AM and in my other post its AM I think just to clarify) or later. Not quite sure. But anyways I had a lot of fun "yesterday" and I had to write it down. Now im gonna hopefully go to sleep and be on time for summer school tomorrow. Who knows. Oh and excuse my spelling errors and the cat pic. I'm still playing around with this thing. Check ya later.
My cat urlLink
Hello whoever is reading this. Yea this is my first post so it wont be much. My life isn't the most exciting thing in the world so don't plan to be glued to your seat reading. :D So I'll summarize what's going on with me. For lil more than 2 weeks I have to go to summer school. It started last Tuesday and ends next Wednesday. Its not that bad. The people are ok and it does get me up in the mornings. I usually sleep late during the summer and I don't like sleeping late sometimes. Miss too much during the day. Anyways lets see. Yesterday Me and my friends met at Shoprite cause our friend Cat(that's what we call her) just started working there and she wanted us to visit and see her bag our stuff lol. Yea she's a bagger. I might work there too I'll have to see. Two of my other friends are applying there too but that and my ex is working there sort of makes me not want to. Sometimes I don't like to go with the crowd. But I guess I'll put in an application and see what happens. So anyway we walked there and tried not to make a scence in the store. Me and Ange took some free cookies and Jamie and Sharon were like whaa? Lol, we acted like such good adults lol thatz hard for Jamie. :P Then went to the check out lane. I bought some cat food and batteries lol. My friend Ange bought some clips. Jamie and Sharon were there two but they broke lol. Sharon has a job at The Lake but she doesn't want to spend her money. When I was getting my bags from Cat and ange was paying for her stuff Jamie just like jumps up to cat and is like HEY GHETTOLICOUS! Lol I was like OMG and Cat looked all embrassed. Jamie is just like what? Lol, So after that we all went home (Ange had to get her hair cut) and then Ange came back over and left at like midnight. It was funny. Lots of fun with the friends even though it didnt seem it. One of those had to be there. :P So anyways went to summer school this morning, nothing too big happened. Now I'm just sitting here with it raining outside and my mix CD going. I'm getting tired lol. So Jamie might get her second holes done today and I might go. That should be fun. :P So, I think that's it for now. Check ya later.
This paper on MQ Series API has been written for all those who wants to start with the basics of MQ Series. MQSeries API The API supported by MQSeries is known as the Message Queue Interface (MQI). There are only 11MQI function calls in total. These allow programs to: urlLink Connect to , and urlLink disconnect from , queue managers urlLink Open and urlLink close queues urlLink Open, put a message on a queue, and close the queue urlLink Put messages on queues urlLink Get messages from a queue, or browse them (leaving them on the queue) urlLink Inquire about the attributes of all MQSeries objects, and urlLink set some of the attributes of queues urlLink Commit and urlLink back out changes made within a unit of work The MQI provides structures in order to supply input to, and get output from, the calls. It also supplies a large set of named constants to help with the construction of options in the parameters of the calls. The definitions of the calls, structures and constants are given in header files for each of the supported programming languages MQI calls In order for a program to use a queue it must first connect to the local queue manager. Once connected the program is then able to perform any further queue attribute, or message get and put operations required (with or without unit of work control). Before the program terminates it disconnects from the queue manager. The MQI calls are briefly outlined in the following sections. Connecting to a queue manager using MQCONN In general it is possible to connect either to a specific queue manager, or to the default one. In either case the queue manager must be local to the connecting program. The input to MQCONN is: Queue manager name To connect to the default queue manager call MQCONN specifying a name consisting entirely of blanks or starting with a null character. The output from MQCONN is: A connection handle A completion code A reason code Disconnecting programs from a queue manager using MQDISC When a program that has connected to a queue manager using the MQCONN call has finished all interaction with the queue manager, it must break the connection using the MQDISC call. The input to MQDISC is: A connection handle returned from a previous MQCONN call The output from MQDISC is: A completion code A reason code The input connection handle will no longer be accepted in any other MQI call Opening a queue using MQOPEN To perform any of the following operations, the relevant queue must first be opened: Put messages onto a queue Get or browse messages from a queue Inquire or set the attributes of a queue Use the MQOPEN call to open the object, using the parameters and options of the call to specify what actions are to be performed with the queue. The only exception is if you want to put a single message on a queue, then close the queue immediately afterwards. In this case there is a shorthand method for performing an open, put and close operation all in one: the MQPUT1 call (outlined later). The input to MQOPEN is: A connection handle returned from a previous MQCONN call A description of the object to be opened, passed using the object descriptor structure MQOD One or more options that control the action of the call (open for input, output, setting or inquiring attributes and so on) The output from MQOPEN is: An object handle that represents the requested access to the queue A completion code A reason code Closing queues using MQCLOSE Once a program has finished all interaction with a queue it is closed using the MQCLOSE call. Input to MQCLOSE is: A connection handle returned from a previous MQCONN call The object handle of the queue to be closed, returned from a previous MQOPEN call Output from MQCLOSE is: A completion code A reason code The queue object descriptor will no longer be valid and will not be accepted in any other MQI call Putting messages on a queue using MQPUT Before it is possible to put messages on a queue an application must be connected to a queue manager, and must have issued an MQOPEN call to open the queue for output. Use MQPUT to place messages on the queue. An application can call MQPUT repeatedly to place many messages on the same queue, following the initial MQOPEN call. Once all the messages have been placed on the queue, call MQCLOSE. If an application wishes to place a single message on a queue and then closes the queue immediately afterwards, it is possible to replace the MQOPEN, MQPUT, MQCLOSE sequence with a single MQPUT1 call (outlined later). If, however, the application needs to place more than one message on the queue it is more efficient to use the MQPUT call. Input to MQPUT is: A connection handle returned from a previous MQCONN call The queue object handle returned a previous MQOPEN call for the desired queue Routing control information and a description of the message to place on the queue, in the form of a message descriptor structure (MQMD) Queue access control information, in the form of a put-message options structure (MQPMO) The length of the application data contained in the message The message data itself Output from MQPUT is: A completion code A reason code If the call completes successfully it also returns the options structure and the message descriptor structure. The call modifies the options structure to show the name of the queue and queue manager to which the message was sent. If the application requested that the queue manager generate the contents of the message identifier field in the control information section of the message (by using the constant MQMI_NONE), the call inserts the value in the field before the structure is returned. If the application defined the message identifier (by filling in the field prior to making the call) the value is returned unchanged. An example program is included at the end of this document, it illustrates the use of this call. It reads an ASCII file and turns each line into a new message. Each message is written to the same queue. Putting a message on a queue using MQPUT1 Use the MQPUT1 call when an application closes the queue immediately after putting a single message on a queue. For example, a server application is likely to use the MQPUT1 call when it is sending replies to many different queues. This call is functionally equivalent to calling MQOPEN, followed by MQPUT and MQCLOSE. The only difference in the syntax for the MQPUT and the MQPUT1 calls is that for MQPUT a queue object handle must be supplied, whereas for MQPUT1 an object descriptor structure is supplied. This is because the MQPUT1 call needs to open the relevant queue before putting the message on it, whereas in the MQPUT call the queue is already open. Input to the MQPUT1 call is: A connection handle returned from a previous MQCONN call A description of the queue to be opened for output, in the form of an object descriptor structure (MQOD) Routing control information and a description of the message to place on the queue, in the form of a message descriptor structure (MQMD) Queue access control information in the form of a put-message options structure (MQPMO) The length of the application data contained in the message The message data itself Output from MQPUT1 is: A completion code A reason code If the call completes successfully it also returns the options structure and the message descriptor structure. The call modifies the options structure to show the name of the queue and queue manager to which the message was sent. If the application requested that the queue manager generate the contents of the message identifier field in the control information section of the message (by using the constant MQMI_NONE), the call inserts the value in the field before the structure is returned. If the application defined the message identifier (by filling in the field prior to making the call) the value is returned unchanged. An example program is included at the end of this document that demonstrates the use of this call. It reads an Oracle table, one of fields providing the name of the queue to receive the rest of the row. Getting messages from a queue using MQGET Applications can get messages from a queue in 2 ways: 1. by removing the message from the queue such that no other program can see it 2. by copying the message, leaving the original on the queue. This technique is known as browsing. The application can subsequently remove the message if needed. In both the above cases the application uses the MQGET call, but it must first have been connected to the queue manager using MQCONN and have opened a queue for input using MQOPEN. When the queue has been opened MQGET can be called repeatedly to browse or remove messages from the same queue. The application calls MQCLOSE when the application has finished getting all the messages it requires from the queue. Input to the MQGET call is: A connection handle returned from a previous MQCONN call The queue object handle returned a previous MQOPEN call for the desired queue A description of the message to get from the queue, in the form of a message descriptor structure (MQMD) Queue access control information in the form of a get-message options structure (MQGMO) The size of the buffer assigned to hold the message The address of the buffer Output from MQGET is: A completion code A reason code The message in the buffer specified, if the call completed successfully The message descriptor structure populated with information from the message The length of the application data in the message It is possible to control how messages are retrieved from the queue via a combination of the message descriptor structure and the options structure, for example: Whether to poll, or wait, for a message The amount of time to wait (in seconds), if waiting is selected Which message is retrieved from the queue Whether the message is removed or copied Whether the get is included within the current unit of work Inquiring about queue attributes using MQINQ Attributes are the properties that define the characteristics of an MQSeries object, including queues. They affect the way the object is handled by the queue manager. Some attributes are set when the object is initially defined, and can only be changed via MQSeries commands. An application can inquire about all the queue attributes using the MQINQ call. The MQI also provides the MQSET call (outlined later) in order to allow applications to change some of the queue attributes. The MQINQ call uses an array of selectors to identify those attributes whose current values are to be inquired about. There is a selector for each of the attributes an application can work with. Before an application can use MQINQ it must first have been connected to the queue manager using MQCONN and have opened a queue for inquiry using MQOPEN. Input to the MQINQ call is: A connection handle returned from a previous MQCONN call The queue object handle returned a previous MQOPEN call for the desired queue The number of selectors in the attribute selector array An array of attribute selectors whose values are set via the MQSeries named constants. Each selector represents an attribute whose current value is to be inquired about. Selectors can be specified in any order in the array The number of integer type attributes to be inquired about. Specify zero if no integer type attributes are specified in the selectors array The address of an integer array with enough elements to hold the output integer attribute values The length of the character attributes buffer. This must be at least the sum of the lengths required to hold each character attribute string being inquired about. Specify zero if no character type attributes are inquired about The address of the character buffer to hold the returned attribute values Output from MQINQ is: A completion code A reason code A set of integer attribute values copied into the specified integer array The buffer in which character attribute values have been copied Setting queue attributes using MQSET Applications can change a subset of the queue attributes using the MQSET call: Get inhibit Put inhibit Trigger control Trigger type Trigger depth Trigger message priority Trigger data The MQSET call has the same parameters as the MQINQ call. However for MQSET, all parameters except the completion code and reason code are input parameters. Input to the MQSET call is: A connection handle returned from a previous MQCONN call The queue object handle returned a previous MQOPEN call for the desired queue The number of selectors in the attribute selector array An array of attribute selectors whose values are set via the MQSeries named constants. Each selector represents an attribute whose current value is to be set. Selectors can be specified in any order in the array The number of integer type attributes to be set. Specify zero if no integer type attributes are specified in the selectors array The address of an integer array that contains the integer attribute values The length of the character attributes buffer. This must be at least the sum of the lengths required to hold each character attribute string being set. Specify zero if no character type attributes are inquired about The address of the character buffer that holds the attribute values Output from MQSET is: A completion code A reason code Committing a unit of work using MQCMIT When a program puts a message on, or gets a message from, a queue, it can decide whether that message is to be included within the current unit of work. This decision is reflected in the put-message or get-message options structure passed to the MQPUT, MQPUT1, or MQGET call. When a message is put on a queue within the unit of work, it is made visible to other programs only when the putting program commits that unit of work using MQCMIT. If the program detects an error and decides that the put operation should not be made permanent, it can back out the unit of work using MQBACK (outlined later). Similarly when a program gets a message from a queue within a unit of work, that message remains on the queue until the program commits the unit of work, but the message is not available to be retrieved by other programs. By default messages are excluded from the current unit of work, therefore any message that is to be included must be done so explicitly in the associated MQPUT, MQPUT1, or MQGET call. The current unit of work encompasses all included messages sent or received since the last MQCMIT or MQBACK call. Input to the MQCMIT call is: A connection handle return from a previous MQCONN call Output from MQCMIT is: A completion code A reason code As can be seen from the input to MQCMIT there is no way in which to specify a single queue to the call, this means that the unit of work covers all queues that were opened using the given connection handle. Therefore when MQCMIT is called all the put and get operations on queues associated with the connection handle are committed Backing out a unit of work using MQBACK When a program backs out a unit of work MQSeries restores the queue to the state it was in before the program performed the first put or get operation within the unit of work. However any operation that was performed outside the unit of work will not be restored. Input to MQBACK is: A connection handle returned from a previous MQCONN call Output from MQBACK is : A completion code A reason code As can be seen from the input to MQBACK there is no way in which to specify a single queue to the call, this means that the unit of work covers all queues that were opened using the given connection handle. Therefore when MQBACK is called all the put and get operations on queues associated with the connection handle are backed out. Sample Code to Demonstrate The Working of MQ APIs MQHCONN HCon; // Connection handle MQHOBJ HObj1; // Object handle for queue 1 MQHOBJ HObj2; // Object handle for queue 2 MQLONG CompCode, Reason; // Return codes MQLONG options; MQOD od1 = {MQOD_DEFAULT}; // Object descriptor for queue 1 MQOD od2 = {MQOD_DEFAULT}; // Object descriptor for queue 2 MQMD md = {MQMD_DEFAULT}; // Message descriptor MQPMO pmo = {MQPMO_DEFAULT}; // Put message options MQGMO gmo = {MQPMO_DEFAULT}; // Get message options : // 1 Connect application to a queue manager. strcpy (QMName,"MYQMGR"); MQCONN (QMName, HCon, CompCode, Reason); // 2 Open a queue for output strcpy (od1.ObjectName,"QUEUE1"); MQOPEN (HCon,od1, MQOO_OUTPUT, Hobj1, CompCode, Reason); // 3 Put a message on the queue MQPUT (HCon, Hobj1, md, pmo, 100, buffer, CompCode, Reason); // 4 Close the output queue MQCLOSE (HCon, Hobj1, MQCO_NONE, CompCode, Reason); // 5 Open input queue options = MQOO_INPUT_AS_Q_DEF; strcpy (od2.ObjectName, "QUEUE2"); MQOPEN (HCon, od2, options, Hobj2, CompCode, Reason); // 6 Get message gmo.Options = MQGMO_NO_WAIT; buflen = sizeof(buffer - 1); memcpy (md.MsgId, MQMI_NONE, sizeof(md.MsgId); memset (md.CorrelId, 0x00, sizeof(MQBYTE24)); MQGET (HCon, Hobj2, md, gmo, buflen, buffer, 100, CompCode, Reason); // 7 Close the input queue options = 0; MQCLOSE (HCon, Hobj2,options, CompCode, Reason); // 8 Disconnect from queue manager MQDISC (HCon, CompCode, Reason);
This is my first article and i would like to start of with my introduction and few things i feel are important in life. I am Visual Ganti, also know as Satish Ganti from INDIA. I work as a software Engineer at Torry Harris E Distributed solution.My main stream includes VC++,VB,C++,COM and ATL With support from databases like ORACLE and Object Store. Everyone in this world dreams to be successfull in his stream of work and i am sure 75% of the people are not satisfied with the work they are into. That is becoz they dont do the work they are best at. they dream of being some thing in there life but endup being something which they would never have dreamt.
I was shockedby the news that my friend was accusing me of trying to convert her religion. I just thought it was all the people around her who are accusing me but it hurt me more to find out that she's the one whose spreading the accusation. I can't blame if the people who heard her will get angry. Well perhaps it was all misinterpretation. Perhaps some of my sharings especially the negative ones let her think that I'm trying to convince her that her religion is not that good. There are things that better left unsaid. All the while I thought I found finally a friend who is an open minded person whom I can share all my feelings and experiences about God and religion. And there are also times that I also want to give her advice for all the problems she had and perhaps being too concern was bad too coz your intentions may be interpreted wrongly. I can't tell her that I was ill because of her. Thinking too much about her and analyzing religion...I went crazy! Past is past. I'm well now so its better to leave everything behind. I will just be extra careful so that I won't be accused anymore. But how come I'm still sad?
Today, I’ve accidentally deleted my yahoo messenger. I tried to upgrade it but later I found out that I couldn’t since I don’t have authority anymore to install to my pc in the office! I miss my friends huhuhuhuh…. So here I am, just dreaming to ease the pain of being alone. Well, if my wish will be granted, I will wish to become a princess. Where everything will be served and all I have to do is sleep when I want to, shopping, traveling, etc. Next to me is my prince, where love never ends… If God will ask me if I wanted to be angel, my reply would be: make me a cherubim so that I could sing all day to you. If I will be asked to enter politics, I will seek the highest position in the land – president. I will stop graft and corruption, encourage foreign investors, implement death penalty to stop the crimes and improve education. If I will be given chance to study again, I will choose medicine. I realized now how important is health and how much I want to help other people. I think I can help more if I am a physician. Haha, keep dreaming…
Life, is not all that bad my friend (Hm-m-mmm...) If you believe in yourself, if you believe there's someone, Who'll walk through life with you. You'll never be alone, just learn to reach out, And open your heart. Lift up your hands to God, And He'll show you the way. Refrain: And he said, "Cast your burdens upon me, Those who are heavily laiden. Come to me all of you who are tired of carrying heavy loads For the yoke I will give you is easy and my burden is light Come to me, and I will give you rest." When you feel the the world is tumbling down on you. And you have no one that you can hold on to. Just face the rising sun, and you'll see hope, And there's no need to run. Lift up your hands to God, And He'll make you feel alright. (Ref.)
Friends do come and go. We met different people everyday and mostly these people become our friends. Moving out, traveling, or simple misunderstandings can cause the lost friendship. Yes, it’s sad to lose friends but some things happen so fast that before we knew it its time to say goodbye. Nevertheless, friends make our daily lives bearable. They are there to laugh with, to cry with, and to share our stories… They are same people who will correct you when you commit mistakes. I can’t imagine a world without friends!
I could say I have everything every girl wanted. A successful career, a loving family, a thoughtful boyfriend, and charming friends. Yet recently my faith was shaken. I could not accept the fact that I was given illness. Why me? I have been faithful to you Lord; I have been an obedient child. I know I let you down sometimes but do I deserve this punishment? Isn’t it the cross that You have given is too much for me to bear? Can you blame me if I came to hate hearing mass or even the priests? Can you blame me if I stop believing You exist? I still remember when a beautiful nun first introduced us to each other in my pre-school. I shouted for joy, now I have a brother! Isn’t it I talked to you everyday? I visited the church every morning just to say hello or even the little things I wish to share with you, I utter a small prayer. I grew up loving you. I know I had pledged of becoming one of your servants when I was sixteen. I know I have broken that pledged when I fall in love… I remember 2 years ago You took care of me when I accidentally fell down the stairs in Malaysia. I only got bruises and scratches though my head hurt terribly. My friend wanted me to go to a hospital but I pleaded not. I just took pain relievers for several months and pray a lot. Alas, during my illness last year my head had been checked and for me it’s a real miracle that the lab shows no abnormalities. **Sigh** Well my illness is not life threatening and it is treatable yet here I am hating You. I’m sorry. Help me Lord to carry this cross. Help me to endure the pain emotionally. And thank you for still being there in spite of everything.
A new month. A new team. I will be transferred officially to the support group. Don't know til when. Maintenance group is OK. The tasks were not that heavy, still have time for surfing and chatting with friends. I will be missing my old team, the friday meeting with Sir Roger, the hazard of going to the office every Saturday. On Thursday, I will have my last lunch with them. It is a small party for the job well done. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to my new team. Well I don't have to worry about completing 8 hours a day, INSIDE the office. I still don't get the idea of strictly staying 8 hours a day in the office. They say its for productivity measure. But who really knows if you're doing your project?? Luckily in the support team, I don't have to worry about completing 8 hours since they are not into it unlike the development team. Whew, its August! I can smell Christmas in the air...
I went to see The Bourne Supremacy w/PJ and Frank and a few other folks on Sunday. The movie was pretty good. I'm glad I went. I met some of PJ's friends and we went to play Tennis after the movie. The courts out by Ebanezer Church are fairly nice. I noticed they have a rock climbing wall, but it's surrounded by a barb wire fence. I think it's a bit ironic that they place something that will hurt you in the way of getting to something that might let you hurt yourself. I guess most people recognize the danger of barb wire, but not so much falling from a 2 story rock climb. I didn't play much b/c it was so hot out and I'm horrible at tennis. I need to get my own racket and tennis balls and practice on the half-court wall out there some before I risk the lives of others ;-) My interview went well on Tuesday, but I didn't didn't get the job. They called me today (Friday) to tell me that I was their second choice and that the only reason the other candidate got the position was because he had 2 years of experience doing what exactly they're doing now with the county. He'd been working on that type of stuff while I was in College. Don Neuner called to tell me that he'd be passing my resume along to another aquaintance and to expect a call from them soon. Maybe he can help me get another job in town. We'll see. I'm still waiting for a call back from Florence School District Three about their job opening. I got to enjoy a nice dessert with friends at Ruby Tuesday this week. Melissa, Jenifer, Robert, Jason, Leslie, PJ, and Mac were there with me. Mac's a friend of PJ's that I met at the movies and the tennis courts. Stephanie was our server. :-) We had a great time. I laughed so hard, I almost cried. I'm a little disappointed I didn't get the job this week, but I'm hopeful that Lake City will be a better fit for me anyway given my level of experience. I'll just brush up on some books for dummies and play around with Linux some at home to prepare for that type of work in the future. Maybe something better will open up for me, but in the meantime, I'll try to stay positive and just work on other things. I need a drink. Stargate better be good tonight! In Vino Veritas. -- There is truth in wine. *one is more likely to reveal the truth when drinking*
I've completed another application -- AND, I got an interview for next week for a PC Tech job w/Florence County! I don't know if I'll get the job, but at least I have an interview! That's progress at least. In other news, I was too sick to hang out w/my friends the other day :-( , but I'm feeling better now. *gasp* I don't know what I'll do with myself if I actually get a job in the 30-43k range! I might explode! :-) Parrrrty!
Yesterday, Candi Called. My mom picked up thinking it was dad at first, then handed me the phone. I asked her who it was -- she said "some girl". I figured it was likely Jenifer -- possibly Melissa or Leslie... maybe even Stephanie or Nancy... nope. A familiar voice on the other end at first sounded a bit like Jenifer -- because that was what I was expecting, but I knew it wasn't Jen. So, I asked who it was. It was Candi. She finally decided to call me out of the blue. It's been nearly a month since we last spoke -- and longer than that since the last time she called here. It wasn't an unpleasant call. It was nice to know that she still thinks of me and misses me some, I guess. She tells me she got her A in English, so she keeps her scholarship. She got her permit and has been driving some, though she was pulled and given a warning b/c her tail light was out. I hear Ernest and other friends have been dropping by at night to keep her company, and she's been visiting her church every weekend and is now part of the choir along with her sister. She told me that I could call her sometime and invite her out if I'd like. I told her that she could call me if she wanted, but I doubt I'd call her... though I might enjoy spending time w/her. I'm a bit torn. I have mixed feelings about hearing from her and spending time with her. It's more fear of emotionally spinning out of control than anything. I think a part of me is still in disbelief that things are over between us and will motivate me to try to date her again. If all we'll ever be is friends, then I'm not sure I can handle that b/c I'm much more emotionally invested than that. I guess time will tell. In any case, I'm not going to make the first move or invest a lot in trying to build a friendship with her after all that's happened between us. Less investment = less risk, so I'll just go with the flow. If being friends is important to her, she'll make the effort and I'll do my best to meet her half-way. I think that's the best strategy. It doesn't burn any bridges and allows some room to grow together or apart naturally. In other news, I've had several professors volunteer to be references for me and I sent three of them forms to fill out for a job I'm applying for. :-) I hope I get it. Once I get a job, then I can work on all the other things in this so-called life ;-) There is no "I" in TEAM, but there is ME !!! :->
I've succeeded in creating my own blog, now I just have to get a life so I can write something interesting in it! ;-) Jenifer took me out the other night for some fine dinin' at Ruby Tuesdays. I don't know how, but with coupons and discounts, we made outta there w/ 2 dinners, 2 salad bars, and 2 megaritas for about $23 before tipping. Remind me to eat at Ruby Tuesday with Jenifer and/or Stephanie more often -- especially when they're working... lol. those discounts pay off! :-) Later, we went to the Swamp and met up with Aaron, Robert, and some guy named Goat. They were mesmerized by a golf video game. Jenifer and I waited for an open pool table and considered playing darts, but we tested our luck at shuffleboard instead. I've discovered I have no control at the game at all. I either toss the dang weight too hard so it slides off the table or I only manage to move it a little farther than half-way to the scoring zone. I think the secret is the sand on the table -- always pour some near the scoring end to slow the weights down more b/c when you play, the sand is brushed away over time. Just when the pool tables finally freed up, the guys left, so jen and I finished our game and headed out. The score isn't important... okay, i lied... it is, but I lost -- that's why it isn't important. lol. Jen kicked my butt somethin' like 17 to 1 ! haha! As for today, I got a phone call from some sort of IT staffing company that I had been referred to by Melissa. I tell ya, that girl's more determined to find me a job than i am -- how sad! lol. I was already planning on visiting ManPower or Olsen for some temp or contract work if I didn't hear anything back from the places I'd applied in the next week or so. So, I'll call them back tomorrow and see what the deal is and if they have a position available. The message they left on my answering machine was for a 3 to 5 week contract job. They made no mention of it becoming permanent or an hourly wage, so if Melissa hadn't recommended calling them, I probably wouldn't. The company is alien to me, so I have lots of questions. At least I know what I'm getting into if I go work for ManPower since I've dealt with them before and know people that work there. It's got offices in Florence. This company, TekSystems (subsidiary of Allegis Group), called me from somewhere in the 864 area code -- most likey Greenville/Spartanburg. Eh, I guess since it specializes in IT staffing I should go for it. It couldn't hurt to see what they want and possibly give it a try, I suppose. I'm still hopeful that I'll get a decent job in town and won't have to go hunting in Columbia, Charlotte, Greenville, Charleston, or Atlanta. hmm... I wonder if there's an opening for me somewhere as a corporate tyrant. I'd love to make millions while playing golf and making simple yes and no decisions with the knowledge that if things go under, I have a nice golden parachute to whisk me away to safety. Where do I apply? :->
Hey... this is my first Blog. Let's hope I don't incriminate myself ;-)
The Beginning... My recent illness started small -- like many things do. It began with a sore throat on weekend. I thought I could fight it off , so I took care to swish my mouth with listerine and gargle with salt water, etc. My worst fear at the time was that I'd lose my voice for my interview the Tuesday after I first got my sore throat. My throat slowly got worse and I began to run a fever. It was about 102 on Friday, so I figured I'd tough it out over the weekend and go to the doctor on Monday, but that didn't happen. By Sunday, I was weak... my legs were shakey and I had trouble keeping my balance. My muscles would shiver and tremble at times, and I didn't feel up to even watching TV. I just layed in bed slowly getting worse. My fever reached 104 Sunday and I was preparing to get in the tub w/ room temperature or cool water to cool down my fever... and asked mom if she was able to drive me to the doctor on Monday -- which is when she caught on that I was seriously ill and the folks decided to take me to the emergency room. The Emergency Room I knew that the ER would take forever, so I took juice with me and cold water so I could stay cool and keep my fever down 'til they could see me. They took my temperature -- 104.8 degrees. After a while, they took me in a wheel chair to a room and started me on my first IV. The IV was painful, but I've never had one before to compare it with. They drew a lot of blood from it at first which may have been why it was so bad. Then, they made me move to take off the sheets which they'd spilled blood on (I soooo did not want to move w/ that needle in my arm). They started me on a saline drip... gave me a bit of morphine since I was unhappy about my arm hurting (which was cool b/c the morphone made my throat stop hurting for about 15 minutes). They gave me x-rays of my chest and throat, ran every test they could on my blood, and took a swab of my throat to test for strep throat. Everything came back negative. They had no clue what was wrong with me. My white count was about 16, which means my white blood cell level was slightly above normal (normal is from 5 to 10), but that's to be expected when you have a fever, so they didn't think I had a bacterial infection. They were looking on the x-rays for an abscess or something more sinister that must be causing the infection. The docs were baffled. They kept coming in saying things like "that's really weird" and "strange... we may need to bring in a disease specialist". They weren't exactly inspiring confidence. Meanwhile, I'm hooked up like the Borg to a bunch of machines monitoring my heart, blood pressure, temperature, and other vitals -- they even took an EKG. They'd run every test except for a urinalysis -- b/c I had gone to the restroom before I left for the hospital and I wasn't ready to go yet... but, they threatened me with a catheter... and man, I was ready to try to go then! Of course, the urinalysis came back with nothing, so they admitted me to a room for observation for a few days. The Hospital Stay Sooo, I got my own room... with basic cable -- no HBO, no Encore.... geez, every hotel in florence gets free HBO at least! I'm stuck in bed hooked to a bag of saline solution w/ a needle in my arm and poppin' 2 tylenol every 4 hours. A guy came in to put a heart monitor on me -- which requires 'lil sticky pads to be put all over my manly, hairy chest. He said that they'd give me an option -- he could either trim my chest hairs, or I could wish he had later when I'm ripping the pads off... lol. After having some experience taking off the EKG pads, I figured I'd tough it out since they came off fairly easily. They gave me the heart monitor b/c my heart was racing. At rest, it was beating like it normally does when I'm running -- even faster than when I get on the treadmill. My heart rate at rest was as high as 185, but slowly went down to 120 as I got fluids in me (normal is usually between 80 and 90). I was severely dehydrated because I hadn't been drinking or eating as much as usual due to my sore throat, they think. I got up just to brush my teeth my second day there, and my heart rate jumped to 144, so the nurses came in to check on me. I think they were worried I might have a heart attack w/ the rate so high. Changing of the Guards My folks decided to stay with me constantly during my stay. That was fine for the first day when I was too weak to do much on my own, but I hated having to kick them out every time I had to use the restroom -- which was a lot since they were pumping me full of fluids. As if it weren't impossible enough to sleep in the hospital with nurses coming to check on you and poking and prodding every so often... not to mention the bed's not as comfortable as my own, but Mom made it impossible to sleep with her in the room. I already couldn't lay back far the first night b/c if i did, I'd choke on my swollen tonsils... I finally got to sleep even with mom's constant shuffling and scooting and scraping the chair around the room, and the nurse wakes me up to take tylenol! argh... I got maybe a half hour's sleep that night. The folks always wanted to talk -- especially with visitors, and I hated not having just some peace and quiet to sleep or watch TV. I also didn't care for them being there to listen in on phone calls -- not that I was taking many b/c I was too tired and sickly to feel like talking much. My mom and dad took shifts at the hospital. I did my best to convince them to leave. At least I got Mom out of there at night so I could sleep better. It wasn't until the last day that I eventually got her to go AWAY, but sure enough she waited to leave until only a few hours before they told me they'd let me go home... lol. The Nurses I had some interesting nurses. Many were adorable single females. Victoria and Courtney Cox (cuter than the one on TV) were especially nice. I also had a somewhat feminine male nurse who threatened me with a sponge bath if I didn't take a shower one night... lol. Of course, I was dying to take a shower since I got there, but I didn't know what I'd have to deal with with the IV and heart monitor if I took one. That threat was enough motivation to get me up to take one. I took one after they took the heart monitor off and told me I could shower w/ the IV wrapped up in plastic for about 10 minutes... best shower I'd had in a long time, I tell ya. I saw a few familiar faces from when I'd been to McLeod before. One of the nurses was the one who was there when I took Candi to get her wisdom teeth out. Come to think of it, wearing the hospital gown, being in a hospital room, and the IV and the nurses... it reminded me a lot of when I was there to help Candi when she had her surgery. I remembered how weak she was... and for a time, I wished she were there to take care of me -- especially since noone seemed to know what was wrong with me and I could get worse. I called Jenifer to tell her I hadn't dropped off the planet -- knowing she'd get the word out to quite a few people... later, I called Candi just in case something happened to me... b/c I'd like to know if it were her there instead of me. The Fever Breaks My second night at the hospital, the docs decided to give me Levaquin, a powerful broad-spectrum antibiotic, for my sore throat since I seemed to have a lot of puss on my tonsils. My sister and a few others like Leslie were a bit shocked I still had my tonsils. My sister had them removed when she got married -- something she'd wanted to do for a long time. She said she's only had 2 sore throats in the past 14 years since her surgery. I'd say that's a good deal. I may have mine out as well. In the middle of the night, after I'd kicked mom out and found a comfortable position in bed to sleep where my tonsils wouldn't choke me... I fell asleep. I was asleep for about 3 hours and woke up in a pool of sweat. I was drenched. The bed was soaked. My fever had broken and my temperature had dropped to 98.3. After that, I felt a lot better. I'd get dizzy if I stood up for more than 15 minutes at a time, and I was still weak, but I didn't feel as hot or as miserable. My fever kept going up during the day and I still needed tylenol to keep it down. It climbed up to 100.5, and the feminine male nurse threatened to stop using the oral thermometer if my fever kept going up... he said the anal one was more accurate and that he'd have to use that if it kept going up. Needless to day... I immediately turned the AC to as cold as possible, stripped the sheets off the bed, and started chugging down ice water!!! That fever was NOT going up. lol. The Visitors Whenever you're in the hospital, you can expect to have at least a few visitors. I've been on the other end of this situation plenty of times. I usually go to visit people -- just to show that I care -- during regular visitation hours and usually when I know others are going and we're expected. Now, don't get me wrong... I love people in general, and I am always happy to see my friends... but geez... When you're wearing basically a sheet w/ underwear, haven't had a shower or shaved, and have to get up every couple hours to use the restroom (They make you go in a jug so they can measure your fluids... ick -- you'd think they'd rig the toilets to do that automatically -- also, the IV doesn't reach the bathroom all that well even w/ the extension cord to the monitor)... it's nice to have a little warning before someone just pops in -- b/c those doors don't exactly lock and I'd prefer to have at least a little privacy and a chance to get situated and look a 'lil decent for company. Most of the people that visited were family and friends of family -- many were freinds of family that I don't know. It's a little weird having total strangers pop in randomly and spend most of their time talking with my parents (you know... on MY time while I'm waitin' for them to leave so I can have some peace)... but, some were nice, and I appreciate the gesture. I just wish that they'd CALL FIRST. All of my friends did... but, apparently my family members and their friends didn't see the need to. It was just a bit frustrating not knowing if and when random people would be walking into my room and not being able to carry much of a conversation w/ them b/c I don't know them. Also, even with the family and friends I did know, I felt like I had to entertain them, but I really didn't have the strength or the mentality to the first day or two. Having said that, I did enjoy having visitors. Mrs. Brooks, the wife of the principal of Wilson and a well-respected nurse in high authority at McLeod, came to visit me a few times. I hear she works two buildings over from my room at the time. Since she's in administration, she turned a lot of heads walking my way. She asked me if there was anything she could do for me -- and I mentioned a percoset that a nurse offered me to help me sleep. As soon as she left, a nurse, Victoria, popped in and introduced herself, gave me a percoset and did a 'lil song and dance telling me if I needed aaaaanything -- a pillow, another blanket... something to eat or drink... anyyyything to let her know. lol. I think the nurses on my hall might have had an extra skip in their step knowing that I was a friend of Mrs. Brooks and that if I wasn't happy, they'd be hearing about it. lol. Of course, she could have just been a real sweet nurse :-) Another nurse, a friend of my parents, dropped in to see me a few times. She was very nice and offered to get me magazines or anything I needed. She dropped off 2 devices that are supposed to help you breathe better -- one exercises your lungs and the other breaks up gunk in your chest to help you cough it up better. They looked pretty funky. One looked like a large kazoo and the other was like a funpark game w/ a ball that floated up when you breathed on a tube. I told people that came in and asked what they were that they were my sex toys. lol. The Flecks, long-time family friends, dropped in for a bit and offered to let me borrow a camcorder and dvd player so I could watch movies in the room, but I declined. I was fine w/ the basic cable and sleeping. They brought their youngest granddaughter, Charley, with them. She's only 4 and had just been to her first funpark w/ rollercoasters. I told her I was jealous. I wanted to go back to Carowinds when I got out and ride the BIG rollercoasters when I got better. She had the cutest expressions and talked w/ her hands and rolled her eyes as she spoke. I love kids. :-) My Grandmother Bell dropped in to visit me -- she forgot to stop at the desk and get a tag from the security guard. I picked on her about the guards coming to get her if they see her in the hallway like that. I told her to act like she was senile and pretend she was a patient who forgot which floor she was on... lol. Jenifer was kind enough to stop in for a while. She brought me a mug filled w/ candy and a balloon. It was very sweet of her to visit. All the other girls called, too. Everyone always asked if there was anything they could do for me or bring me. After hearing so many folks ask me if there was anything they could bring me, I decided to get a bit creative. I told the girls they could bring me some strippers ;-) Jenifer said I wouldn't want those nasty girls dancin' around in my hospital room... so, I told her that the girls could come and dance naked for me instead -- I figure they're clean ;-) lol. Hey, what are friends for? I coulda been on my deathbed! lol. So, the girls came over and took their tops off and danced and played w/ each others nipples... okayyyyy so maybe that didn't happen, but i had a fever of 104.8, morphine, tylenol, and Levaquin in my system -- and let's not forget the lack of sleep among other things... so, I coulda been a bit delusional, but hey, i'll remember it the way I want to, okay?!?!? hahahaha. ;-) Leslie asked if I had any hot nurses giving me sponge baths... I told her no, but she was welcome to come over and do that if she liked... lol. She was real sweet and got out of work early so she could try to visit me one day, but I had to call her and let her know I was going home that day. She got me a card, but I think I'll get it in a few months -- kinda like her belated birthday card ;-) The Brooks and Wilson's staff sent me flowers, and my pastor, Jim Crooks, visited me and even gave me a lead for a possible job opening which was very nice of him. Lots of others visited and family members dropped in on their lunch breaks to check on me -- real nice of 'em. I was overjoyed that I'd be going home to my OWN bed, my own room and my own digital cable TV w/ my computer and the internet... Now I'll definitely have to buy a laptop -- just so I can use it for vacations, hospital stays, and other such times. Even if I don't have 'net access, I could still write e-mails to send later.... and play games 'n watch DVDs on it :-) Home At Last I was dog tired after getting home. I slept constantly -- even more than my usual lazy self does. I was weak and found it difficult to stand for more than an hour or two without getting dizzy. I've slowly gotten better since then. I think maybe the antibiotic made me sleepier than usual along with my being bedridden for a while. I think I'm back to my normal self now, and I'm ready to party or ride some rollercoasters now that I'm done w/ my antibiotics and well! :->
last night i set every alarm clock i know exists within ten feet of my room to go off at 10:00, because i had to work at 11 :) (not that work is good.. but.. okay, nothing good came from that. i felt like i'd been hit by a truck. 3 advil keep the big trucks away..) anyways.. work from 11-5, caitlin bothers me, but.. i guess i'll buckle down. i love my job way too much to complain. i'm working on saving up enough money to buy linkin park's "reanimation" cd. (ask me about what i mean by saving up) it's pretty good, for being 100% remixed material. anyways.. got home from work, signed on to messenger, this pops up: Tessa - (add some crazy lil sister shit here): when r u coming to pick me up? mortimerjones: (add some crazy geek shit here): oh shit.. when did you want me to do that?? so yeah.. i forgot that i had to go get my sister after work. went to olivia, made my car go fast again (add r-ckl-s- e-dang-rm-nt to my record, please, officer.) and got back in time to see laura in her natural habitat -- work! no, i'm j/k. although she does work a lot, i do too.. :( laura leaves on sunday. it's sad. i think i might cry. i hope mom makes that appointment. anyways. i'm really hyper, so i think i'll go make fun of chat room people. nite
Music: Jon Secada - Just Another Day Food: Getting there. Today was awesome. Today rocked the "hizouse." Okay.. wasn't THAT great. Rolled out of bed.. drove to Olivia. Made my car go really fast on the road back. (Don't tell my mom. She'd hurt me.) Called Laura. Excerpt from the conversation here: Laura: would you get your butt over here? Me: what's over there? Laura: me! Me: sounds like a good reason to me.. Anyways.. it's moments like that when i wonder if there's something more to our relationship, or if it's just siblingly love. Laura confuses me sometimes, but i just buckle down and make a bad joke that she laughs at. Anyways.. in reference to the food issue, i'm going to walmart, and i'll post later. bye now.
music: evanescence and linkin park, with a twist of REM food: shoulda, coulda, didn't. oh well. My soul feels cold. Not really.. cold, like... low temperature.. cold like.. numb. I can't feel it. I don't know if I've ever really 'felt' my soul. It's presence.. I can't remember it. Maybe I don't have a soul. Maybe I'm the one soulless being on this planet. If I am.. well, i guess that makes me unique, doesn't it? I just wish i could feel.....something. Love, happiness.. something. I don't like this at all. Mom says she's going to call the clinic monday for medicine, and for the first time in my life, I'm actually looking forwawrd to it. Music has been the only thing keeping me going lately. Music, Steve and Beth, that's all you need, right? wrong.. because eventually your depression spreads and it just makes you feel worse. nip it in the bud, isn't that what they say? anyways.. i'm gonna go kick some ass at trivia to work off the frustrations. later.
music : the village soundtrack food: none here i am writing a blog. an uncomprehendable sadness has fallen over me.. and quite seemingly for no reason. yesterday, went to willmar, had a blast, was on a euphoria high for most of the night until i get home and find out that two of my closest friends are having horrible horrible times in their lives. wow.. maybe that's it? but i felt good today.. someone.. please explain all of this to me i'm confused. help?
Presently the nails on my left hand are painted purple. The right has pink. My thumbs have an extra coat of glitter. It's my birthday!!! I received from my parents the Special Edition Labyrinth DVD. It came with a really cute little booklet, a scene composite of Sarah with the Fireys, and a goblin sketch card. The only additions to the DVD was a mega-photogallery. This is my favorite movie - DEAL WITH IT! My sisters just handed me a Build-A-Bear - they named it Sally Doobie - It's a name I made up when I was...maybe...three? (From Mary Jodie and Gwanana Took, my sisters other names.) They also purchased the Hawaiian outfit, to satisfy my Tiki obsession... and a faerie dress! It was a World Wildlife Fund Lion. Technically it was a Build-A-Lion? Anyway a $1.oo went to the WWF. This makes me very happy. Ryan and my brother apparently went in on a gift together - and it's in the mail. I'm curious by nature. Hummmmmm........did I mention it was my birthday???!!!
Yesterday I got to see my good friend Christian, he's a good kid - he's got a good grasp on life, sometimes I think not his own but in general he's definitely a sweet kid. He lives far far away... My two best friends in high school, whom I've kept really close contact and whom I absolutely love ~ live all the way in Chicago... (Hi Akiba! Hi Heather!) Jeremy moved away with Christian. None of my other friends here live closer than 45min. away... even my ex lives a freak'n hour away... All this traveling... gas prices are going upupupupup......I don't have a car - not that I'm allowed to drive. Oi!
Do you know what a port is? (This blog is turning into a medical journal...gross...) They put a tube in your chest so it's easier to get medication and take blood. They also wanna give me one of those things... They'll take me kicking and screaming....
I'm not going to post everyday...
Most people don’t know what they have. Today I went to the doctor for yet another blood test, a cbc if you know what that is. Apparently my platelet count is dropping. What do platelets do? Basically they are for clotting. If you get a cut they are why you stop bleeding – I’m on a blood thinner. Should something happen, the bleeding wouldn’t stop. Since only vampires find this attractive, I’ve been in the hospital every day since my birthday. Yes, I spent my birthday in the hospital – I’ve spent my birthday in the hospital for years running… I’ve lost count and I’m only 24. Today I went to the doctor for yet another blood test. What I did get was a bone/marrow biopsy…and some other bone marrow thing I can’t pronounce. They stuck a needle in my back (not the first time this has happened, I’ve had a spinal tap and other various tests of this nature.) It didn’t really hurt that much, it tickled a lot actually – your suppose to keep still for these types of things and I was squiggling around… I did cry though. It was one of those “why do these things keep happening to me” cries. Yesterday I heard someone say people who have cancer are lucky, because of the attention they get and the help people give them – things of that nature. I see people around me complaining about the stupidest shit – a bad hair day, or the store was out of there favorite ice cream. Now, I’m not saying that my problems are worse than anyone else’s, cause they aren’t, but to me I feel like screaming – Pick Your Battles! I have a few friends that hate it when I say this but… It could be worse. Most people don’t know what they have. Is it so wrong to ask people to look around and maybe appreciate what’s there? I wasn’t able to walk for a long time, now I take my dog out and play with her because I CAN! I find it utterly amazing ~ while people just label me loony. Walking, jumping, dancing, I’d like to add roller skating to my list of my long lost arts but I haven’t found a pair or roller skates…NOT BLADES!!! Hell – for me being able to leave my house THE long lost art. I have to wait till the doctors give the say so – It wasn’t so bad when couldn’t get up but now that I can walk again I’m ready to walk right OUT!!! ARG!!! I can stand outside and look at the stars. I can walk down the road and buy a big gulp at 7-eleven. I’ve been dancing…when no one is around. *^_^* Great, I’m the damn Little Mermaid… I just know we have so much and we never stop to look at it, love it, recognize the value in things… in people…
Father's Day - My poor dad, all he wanted to do was sleep. Instead he got to drive my mother and I to the hospital so I could get platelets, then my mom wanted to go to Jo-Ann Fabrics, then she wanted to eat at Shells. He worships that woman. So - I've been 24 for at least 24 hours. I feel it. Granted I'm certainly not ready to pack up my Legos, and I will never stop playing with my dolls (I adore miniature tea sets!) But... I don't want to play with my obsessions within the confines of my parents home. It's a little harder for me right now cus' I just had a freaking stem-cell transplant but I really can't wait to leave. On a lighter note I'm planning to sew Samantha (my american girl doll) a Dorothy costume. My new Lion Build-a-Bear? is going to be the Cowardly Lion, and seeing as my sisters also have Build-A-Misc. Animal...Zander (an actual bear) will be the Tin Man. And Greg the Bunny will portray the Scarecrow. All will have costumes.
I just got back from Chicago for my three month 'check up' after my stem cell transplant. I look like a heroin addict. Hello Officer...no I'm not on drugs, well only prescribed ones...I'm sorry I'm not trying to be cheeky... it's the truth I swear... Ignore the black and blue track marks! AND WHOA~!!! I saw some pictures of myself just before I left for Chicago to get that treatment, GOODNESS ~ ! I looked absolutely horrific! I was damn scary, at least I look better now - not much but I'm working on it. I was 200lbs when I left and last time at the doc's I was 164 - I'm happy cause I need new pants!!! My face is so much smaller - I saw that picture and on the one hand I was terrified by the way I looked and on the other hand I was soooo glad I don't look that way now! I have bruises up and down my arm and some nice big ones on my hands... a little less than a year and I'll be done with all this mumbo jumbo. I can't *ucking WAIT! I stopped take'n a lot'o'pills. Lovely.
... you think you knonw some people... Anyway! I'm not much of a music buff. I rely on my friends to introduce me to anything new I might like. When they do introduce me to new and exciting things - all those wonderful lyrics seem to fit in my life, state of mind, dreams. I just got the new Cure Album entitled 'The Cure.' I hate it when bands title the CD after the band name... (Robert Smith I forgive you - but only cause I love you.) They don't just write depressing songs by the way. And Lovesong makes me melt every time - I always have that romantic notion He'll lullaby me to sleep with that song. (I'm talking about my dream lover by the way and it's not who your thinking. I think I'm just about done with him.) I listened to the new album only once so far. It basicly sounds like their other stuff. Everyone tells me all Cure songs sound the same - Trust me... I don't care... they don't sound the same to me. There seem to be a lot of goodbyes in this CD. Some rude awakenings, mournfull lyrics, and it's been fun. I just broke up with my boy toy of four years. It's hard for me - I remember what being lonely was! Every song on the radio seems to pertain to me. As does this compact disk that my favorite band wrote for me. I like Poe. I wish she'd come out with a new album. July 25 the Cure will be in Tampa and I couldn't find anyone to go with me. That's a week after Elise's birthday! (They have a song to Elise, lucky girl!) I wanted to go....REALLY BAD.... or at least find someone who was going, I could have at least gotten a T. Oh well right? *sigh*

"I have deep faith that the principle of the universe will be beautiful and simple." ~I want to make a shirt and I'm looking for a good quote, I liked this one along with the next couple...all are by Albert Einstein. "Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. THAT'S relativity" ~Any comments? "Imagination is more important than knowledge." ~Some of the advice I like to live by... "There are two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle The other is as though everything is a miracle." --Albert Einstein ~Everything is a miracle...
I think it's very important to surround yourself with good people. Talent, humor, poetry, and beauty... that sums up all my friends... I've recently met some new people, remet others... good times. Everyone seems to be wonderfulness ~ *^_^* Even with all this friendship - I can't find a bloody person to go to the Cure concert with me...ARG! I'm going to write to Angelina Jolie. She'll go with me. Maybe she'll pay!!! My sister can babysit her rugrat. I miss my friends, I've been stuck in this fake house. *GROWL* I'm lonely. I realize I don't like crowds, but this is ridiculous...'one is the lonelyest number...' (I knew that song before it was in Magnolia... SO THERE! I have nothing to do. I have everything to do. ...distress...
It’s funny how life works. The outside of my journal has a marigold and gold very stylized sun on either cover. I decided to write out lyrics that have to do with the sun on all the rays protruding from it’s face. See if you know who sings some of these… 1. SUNNY DAYS chasing the clouds away… 2. IM GO’NA SOKE UP THE SUN GO’NA TELL EVERYONE TO LIGHTEN UP… 3. I TRY TO LOOK UP TO THE SUN BUT MY EYES BURN… 4. SUNNY, YESTERDAY MY LIFE WAS FILLED WITH RAIN 5. LET THE SUNSHINE, LET THE SUN SHINE IN… 6. I’LL SURF TILL THE SUN SETS BEYOND THE HORIZON… 7. COME TASTE THE SUNSWEET BERRIES OF THE EARTH 8. I AM THE SON THE HEIR/ I AM THE SUN THE AIR 9. ON AN ISLAND IN THE SUN WE CAN PLAY AND HAVE SOME FUN 10. FROM THE DAY WE ARRIVE ON THE PLANET AND BLINKING STEP INTO THE SUN… 11. YOU’RE THE ONE YOU’RE THE SUNSHINE 12. MIGHT AS WELL BE WALKING ON THE SUN 13. BLACK HOLE SUN wont’cha come 14. GOOD DAY SUNSHINE…. 15. HERE COMES THE SUN… 16. YOU ARE THE SUNSHINE OF MY LIFE… 17. YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE MY ONLY SUNSHINE 18. SUNSHINE ON MY SHOULDER MAKES ME HAPPY… 19. I’M WALKING ON SUNSHINE… 20. SUNSHINE, LOLLYPOPS RAINBOWS… I gave my little sun on the front cover the makeup of Death, the neil gainman comic book character, on the back cover Peter, of Kiss. When my sisters and I dressed up as Kiss for Halloween he’s the one I dressed up as. In the inside cover there are three more suns… they will get to be the other member of Kiss. (You know I just love to get off topic.) N.E.Way……. I was asking anyone who walked past me for songs that had to do with the sun, the above playlist being what was come up with. One of my favorite Cure songs is called Mint Car… “the sun is up I’m so happy I could scream!” It would have the word ‘sun’ in the very first line… “and there’s nowhere else in the world i’d rather be” I almost shot myself… “than here with you it’s perfect, it’s all I ever wanted *oh*” How could I have forgotten? “i almost can’t believe that it’s for real” You can say that again… “so kiss me quick *ah*” BRILLANCE HAS STRUCK! BLESS THAT ROBERT SMITH! (He married his high school sweet heart you know!) Two wonderful thing happened – I got a title for my journal (Mint Car, to be written on the spine.) And something for the first page – I have this lovely habit of never putting anything on the first blank page of my journals because nothing ever seems to be important enough – nothing ever fits just quite right. When I get a new journal it’s hard enough to taint the lovely new pages with my crap! The first page… nothing ever…. NADA! Excuse me I have to go dance around a bit brb…. …better… okay so on the first page I’m going to put the lyrics to Mint Car… the title is so marvelously off in left field, and the lyrics are so brilliantly sunny and lovely. VOILA!
This is another one of by kittens, Laia - Like the Princess from the Star Wars movies. This is Godzilla. She's the smallest mammal we own. (Or maybe she owns us!) I dislike stuffed animals, I find they are a lot like crack. The only two I have found I can tolerate are my build-a-bear/lion and one I have of Jack Skellington's dog, Zero. Here's my lion with her faerie dress on and my doggie Mapo.
…problems. The world is full of pointless problems, terribly important to whoever – virtually nonexistent to everyone else. My current crisis as such is… I like to blog. I love to blog. (What the hell kind of a word is blog?) I’m on the computer typing away frequently. I’m not the best writer – but that’s not really what it’s about is it? What do you do, show off in front of your friends? Try to tone down the truth so no one takes offence? Bullshit? I am *so* not saying that is wrong. Who reads blogs anyway? Who cares?! Eeeeh……. I’m just a little mad right now…cause of that problem. I kinda need the computer to blog and my mother doesn’t want me on the computer anymore. Apparently I have the computer all day… that’s her problem. She can’t say I don’t let anyone else use the computer because the truth is if anyone wants it I have no difficulty handing the computer (it’s a new nice laptop!) to whom ever wants to play with the new toy…just gimme a couple minutes to let me save whatever I’m doing and it’s yours. So right here and now people – I am saving up all my pennies for a laptop ~ Maybe I’ll paint it pink… red? *Natasha* needs her own computer keys… Speaking of blogs – I have a blog. Also have a journal. I love my blog – I love to rant but all my real stuff goes into the journal. I have letters I’ve never sent tucked in the pages… some of the best writing I’ll ever do I think – but I’ll never send those letters. I don’t let people read my journal either. I used to think I needed lines. All my other journals, since… oh my goodness… since the second grade? maybe? It was poems and stories and songs – doodles, lots of doodles. It was really thick inch and a half? It had bright blue binding and corner…things… it was an Asian jacquard print – I thought it was gorgeous and I still have it somewhere…… anyway, it has lines *blue ones.* My favorite kind of journal was the composition notebook (it has lines) – I think my favorite ever ~ I decorated the outside of this comp. book (I hated the cow’wannabe thing.) with black electrical tape – very straight lined – across the front and back cover. This was my freshman year in high school. That was certainly a year of change… then sophomore year *Natasha* was QUEEN of the I’m going to skip school people. In Chicago I’d skip and go to libraries and museums and zoos…. here… there’s nothing to do! My second sophomore year I got freak’n straight A’s….sad state of affairs. That was also when I got diagnosed with lupus, put on an obscene amount of prednisone, move to a new state, cut off from the whole damn world… oi… when I met Ryan I sort of stopped journaling – cause of college – I still wrote, but I focused on other creative pursuits…but no crystallized language my friends. I started up again after I got sick this last time, with a journal without lines. I feel like I've been born again. Mypages are half full, I want to start shopping forsome new ones.No lines...... I told someone, I’m pretty sure it was Christian, that if I got a blog I’d be forced to put all these emotional entries. I couldn’t just skim the surface, I’d be just too damn ‘open.’ “At this moment this is me at my most masochistic…” but I have to admit, all my really juicy thought processes are kept in my journal. Today I was actually going to share some of that – a letter – strike that ~ an epic poem to Ryan. I didn’t because I was feeling when I wrote it, and with the last word feeling was gone. Now the importance, urgency, and fervor are over. The last word was cinder. A phoenix rises up out of ashes. Earlier today, my sister and I were driving – she had the radio on – I’m an adamant believer in whoever is driving gets to pick the music. Veruca Salt, Seather…..(sp?) was playing. Then – some weird jamaican music started playing. I asked the heavens to please make this a good song…”whenever i’m alone with you, you make me feel like I am home again” Granted it was not the Cure singing it – but this is the worlds greatest love song. The cover band didn’t sing the ‘fly me to the moon part.’ This is a sign. Lovesong – with Robert Smith singing would have been the best but ladies and gents… but…this is a sign. Something good is going to happen, it’s not going to be tomorrow – maybe even not next week… but it’s on the verge. Though I can’t go to the concert – their close… it’s close. The future. Something permenante.
I'm still figure'n this out... Congrats Robin and Todd! One of my sexy kittens, Yogi Happy21st Birthday Tony! Your first legal pina colada - *sniffle*
Lump sat alone in a boggy marsh Totally motionless except for her heart Mud flowed up into Lump’s pyjammas She totally confused all the passing piranhas... These lyrics would have been ten times better if... Totally motionless.... was Totally emotionless...
...i throughly believe in ice cream bars, but i hate the taste of those wooden sticks...
I have two rants today. One will be babble about myself, the other about people my age…HA! HA! I will start with myself (so there!) Yesterday, oh my… I was *blech*, *blah*, and *hurumph*. I was thinking I’m going to have to ask my friends to kick my butt because I was really kind of – not inspired. (Maybe I just needed some sleep?) I don’t know? But at the moment…when I woke up this morning – I felt so good. = I sew. = I think you all know that if you need some curtains I could help you out…I got the Queequeg shirts done. Before today I was ready to bash my sewing machine into a mechanical mess. I just couldn’t sew! Now, At this moment I am yearning to wrap myself in fabric and thread. I didn’t really want to write (not that I conjure words like Jeremy or Christian anyway but still!) – I didn’t want to even look at all my pretty markers, pens, and paint… I normally adore paper and I was ready to put my nice expensive paper on the floor…for my dogs… if you have dogs you’ll know what I mean. - - - I am so ready to go art iNsAnE. I am in an awesome mood….I’m fucking euphoric…why? Who the hell knows but I’m going to stop questioning it. I think I’m going to sew Samantha, my American Girl doll, her Gryffindor (Harry Potter for all you muggles,) uniform. I just need some dark grey fabric! That doll has a more interesting wardrobe that me. Any whoo!!! Lethargic and listless – say goodbye! …what kind of magic spell to use? Slime and snails – or puppy dog tails – thunder or lightning… but baby said…..dance, Magic dance, Magic dance….. ( *GLURP* ~ RANT TWO! I was elevator hopping with a bunch of people in their 80’s. They were cracking jokes and commenting cheerfully and playing around… I was having a great time with these blue hairs. (I can say that cause I have two different colors of blue hair dye so I can be a blue hair as well.) When I hang out with people closer to my own age, all most of them ever talk about is being depressed – “I’m sooo angst…” He loves me not. I can’t. I can’t. Let’s drown are sorrows… Good lord people! Give it up! How old are you? Twenty one, Twenty two? These should be the best years of your life! Do you honestly HONESTLY think you have it that bad? Get off your ass and get out there and use the gifts that god gave you! All the people I know are wonderful, beautiful, talented – fucking creative people… what are they doing with all that gloriousness…. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! It’s okay to be happy! I’m happy just because I know these amazing people. We may not be best friends but that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t help you out if you asked. I see all this brilliance going to WASTE! People don’t change unless they want to so – I’m just wasting my typing skills on all this but I would love to see more happier people my age running around. If I’m in a elevator with people my age… they look like they would rather bite my head off than crack a smile….heathens! Lighten – the hell – up. What ever situation your is – it could be worse – I’m not saying your situation isn’t important… I’m just saying, do you really think it’s that bad?...really?...
I believe in true love at first site.
Jim… that was his name, the TGI Friday cutie. I’ll explain the letter J in a moment but just to add I really know how to pick ‘em. He’s the managers son! Nice *Natasha* - ‘aint it the truth! *sigh* Okay – well, he wasn’t working yesterday BUT the hostess that was working with him was there so I asked her all this vital info. (She thought it was cute – She was cool.) First I just asked her if he was working… “Oh, no he’s not…”then I mentioned I thought he was adorable. She smiled, seated a party of four and we continued our conversation. “Ha, yah well, he’s the managers son.” I know how to pick ‘em. We both started laughing. I went to my table. Unfortunately most of robin’s friends were girls! Or guys with girlfriends! (Damn it robin!) That’s okay. That’s okay. ~ So it’s the end of the night my sisters and I were leaving – the hostess was still at the door and there I was, I still didn’t have the little muffin’s name. “It’s Jim.” Thanks. Oh and if any of my friends want to go out to dinner we’ll be going to TGI Friday’s at the Crossroads… (and no I didn’t leave my number.) ~The ‘J’ phenomenon~ Okay every since I decided boy’s didn’t have cooties… well not as many cooties… I have cute little crushes on these guys with J-names. Jonathan Brandis was the first one… my tini bopper crush. *sigh* Back to semi-reality… I started liking this guy in high school, we never really went “out” but we’d hang out and he’d take me home all that ‘cutesy’ crap. His name was Joe. Then I started stalking this guy in my music class. He was greek! Talk about tiptoeing around each other! There we were last day of school (my birthday so I had already made plans…) He asked me to a Cubs game… THE CUBS! Hindsight is 20/20. I should have gone with him. I moved to Florida – my friends sent me a yearbook… inside the outline of a puzzle piece he signed it. “I really liked you, I wish you could have stayed. – Jason” Then there was a Jeff… I think the only J-named guy I never had a ‘crush-crush’ on was Jeremy – not that he’s not a cutie, I just never had a crush on him. Ryan was an anomaly! Well kind of – he was suppose to have been named Jeremy! I also have dreams about the number 10. J is the tenth letter of the alphabet. Either it has to do with the letter J or October…? I know. This is a crazy kind of thinking… DUH! This is my blog… did you expect anything less? And now Jim….HA! this is the way my life goes….
HA! You know what I noticed today… (of course you don’t you weren’t there!) I noticed that I sing to myself ~ out loud ~ I was sitting around and playing cards and I was singing along with Rhett Miller. “Sure,” you say, “I do that to. I sing along with the music.” Wonderful! I think it’s great and everybody should sing along. The only problem was THERE WAS NO MUSIC! There I was in front of people that didn’t know me… ‘You come and you glow and you hum and you hover – I cannot believe that you’re my lover…’ I noticed one lady staring at my wondering what my parents had done wrong. (But then again this lady is recovering from cancer and she’s still smoking – where did HER parents go wrong!) I’ve been told I have a song for everything. Now let me say this here and now: I am not a music person. I don’t really listen to the radio. I have my own little music collection and I don’t know anyone else with comparable tastes. I know I’m a music follower. My friends will play me an album, I decide if I like it or not (most of the time not.) I know almost every oldies song played on the radio. I do believe NONE of my amigos listen to the oldies of their own free will. HA!HA! Just wait till I get my own car – if I have to drive someone somewhere MY music will be blasting in their ears! …you’ve got a heart so big! goes all the way to California… I like singing to myself....
...I was so excited about finally being able to go out of my house..... the party is tomorrow! Okay - so let me tell you about the adorable host that was helping us! He was so bloody cute. And... I didn't give him my number! I know, I know, ME queen of telling my friends "Give 'em your number!" By the way only Christian is allowed to ridicule me about this cause I bothered him the most. But damn were we flirty. It felt great~ Plus ~ I'll get to see him tomorrow if he works!!! But now there's pressure for me to look even cuter than I did today!!! I thought I might have forgotten how to really flirt flirt... nope nope.... I still got it!!!!!! But should I give him my number!????? *hee hee* maybe I'll just give him my address...
TONIGHT TONIGHT ~ I'll go and party tonight..... YAH! I'm going to Robin and Todd's engagment party - I'm sure hot single stud muffins will be flaunting themselves shamelessly! I'm hope'n for at least a hot waiter....MEOW! I'm going to wear a cute short skirt - new cons - I'm so excited!
how come things are going so well and I'm so depressed? Quick Overview... I used to weigh over 200lbs because of the pills I was taking, now I'm at 160 and none of my old clothes fit me! My mom had to take me shopping because my pants were literally falling off! I got a really cute gray pleated short skirt, an awesome punky pink one, two basic girlie cut t's, (one green to match my Converse the other in a light grey,) you can see a picture of my fucking awesome green and pink cons on Christian's blog (thank you Christian!) oh yah - and this button down girlie fushia shirt with black stripes... IT WAS A SMALL - the size I mean, I I love my new girlier wardrobe. I next purchse is a pair of pink Dickies. I used to have Dickies overalls, they were my favorite pants, when I worked backstage I could carry my hammer and nails, paintbrushes, string, safety pins, gum and my watergun (to spray the naked actors....there's nothing like a the wet look on your favorite actor!)... I still need more girly clothes... Medically everything is going well, everything is on track now. My platelets are going back up - by themselves... by next week I think I'll only have to take one pill instead of the over twenty pills I used to have to take - no chemo - no nothing! (No signs of Lupus YAY!) My blood pressure is great, my pulse is a little high but I can help that out with exercise - which I have been doing! Everything is peachy. Since I don't have to work, and I can't go to school - I have all day to do whatever the fuck I want... so what do I want? Brillant question... I want to get my old shity job back, I want to be bored to tears in front of a college professor that looks like various forest creatures ~ depending on the angle. I want to get the hell out of my parents house (I love them dearly but I'm 24! If my mother tells me to 'clean my room' again I'm going to explode into tiny bits of flesh...) I want to learn how to drive, or rather, how to park. I want a car. A pink car. With flames. White anime flames hot on the tail of faeries on either side. I want to stop being a mooch to everyone I know! Yah, I know I was sick and I still am BUT in my mind I am the most annoying person on the damn planet. Everything needs to be done for me, I mooch for money, car rides, clothes, food, shoes... you name it I've mooched it. I HATE IT! In my next life - hermit - deep deep into the woods - I'll never have to rely on anyone. It'll be wonderfull. I want to be someones inspiration. I don't even know when I'll be able to be normal again... at least normal for me. I saved a turtle today. Driving back from the hospital, we passed the Car Wash on 192 by Valencia/Big Lots area... it was slowly making it's way under the tires of huge redneck trucks. I pushed it into the grass. I stood in the pouring florida thunderstorm rain so my mother could go get a box from a store in the strip mall and so the turtle wouldn't try to hobble back into the road. We're going to take the poor thing to the Serpentariam (sp?) or GatorLand tomarrow. It's almost as big as my forearm. I'm really not allowed to touch turtles so I couldn't find out if I saved a delicate flower or a great typhoon. Girl turtles usually have a flatter bellyshell - while the boys have an arched one...::bachicawahwah::.... I like reptile people. They are the underdog of pet owners - and arguably the most passionate. I've been to reptile shows and dogs shows... some dog people are just too damn stuffy - PLUS at the reptile show the really cute guys had awesome tatoos *sigh a half!* I saved a turtle today. Have you ever seen 'The Creator' with Peter O'Toole? I love that movie... I'm going to look for the Big Picture... I'll be right back...
the 28th! We're throwing my sister ~Nery Laura~ a birthday party. If your in the 'hood come visit my crib! Music themed.... PARTY!
Badly, I can see the outcome. Please stretch your mind to some thing new. I’ll laugh at you if this comes out my way. Crazy length of string cut to match my mood. Float above the clouds, float in my parade. How long should this be? Two miles long, two miles. You will pick up the girl who walks her dog, She’ll stare in wonder and fascination. Reality can screw with your glad mind. Pretty, you need to chill, follow me home.
A lot of people listen to music in the car, busy lives. Hurry hurry! There’s no time! The only time these people know how to relax is sitting in the bucket seats and fall asleep at the wheel because of gentle humming of their car. I adore that purr. I don’t drive. I know how but I don’t. (It involves money.) I get to sit in any seat other than the drivers and float into the engine. I’m sure I do way to much floating – so what? ….I know you might roll your eyes at this but I’m so glad that you exist….. I listen to music while I write. I do so enjoy being laid back. (My mom didn’t know what ‘twang’ was. It was mentioned during CSI and she had no idea what it was – my sister, Laura and I tried to explain it to her. Rachel was there. It was a good conversation.) Florida, state of unconscious. Drive 20 mph. Smell the orange blossoms. Retire. I’m from Chicago. I’m different so these thoughts weren’t foreign to me but very different. Chicago, it’s the best city in the world. People are usually pretty damn nice – not so much so in New York. New York is the France of the US. California – I’ve never been there. (but leave before it makes you – soft.) I have a pal in the San Diego area. Chicago, always something to do – when I was there they were filming the Weatherman and Oceans 12. The saying was that if you saw a yellow Ferrari, you just saw Nick Cage… I LOVE him! (He worked with Angelina Jolie!) They were looking for extras but I was caged in the hospital. I love being cheesy. I COULD HAVE BEEN IN A NICHOLAS CAGE MOVIE! They were filming down the damn street from where I was! Chicago, always nothing to do. Tons of empty used book stores, empty coffee shops. Housing is a little expensive but pay is higher. The buildings actually touch the sky. If everyone would grab onto a star, next stop, the moon. It’s a port city down the river from New Orleans. (Another city I love.) It gets really fucking cold. I love it. Snuggling, but I don’t like that word. Nestling? Hiding under the covers with your love affair… one of my favorite aspects of cold weather. *bleck* Curse the English language for not having a word I can use. It gets sweaty, sultry, sticky sweet in the summer. Lots of running around naked to pretty hate machine. Perfection in between. Rainy beautiful days decorated with grey and wet. Sun and wind. The train. And we’re back to the purr. I get to go back in Sept. then again in March. Chicago boys are so cute!
I've tried to tell Ryan I want to meet her. I know we'd get along. She'll never get the chance to say she hates me or likes me either way if she never meets me...but she has to meet me. Thank you Rachel. Thank you Elise. Ryan, stop dicking around ~ let's get on with our lives. I kow what your thinking and stop it. I love everyone and you know it. Cut the crap, I don't have the time to be unhappy, noone does. Everyone desearves to be gloriously happy ~EVERYONE~ You, Cindy, and especially me. I've been too sick for too long to deal with this - this situation sucks. Let's have dinner! Let's have lunch! Whatever you want to do... no games.
I made the shirt, black one. I put a planet in the middle and around this purple and silver planet ~ silvery white letter proclaim GRAVITY ALWAYS GETS ME DOWN. It really didn't come out as kick ass as I wanted it to - but it 'aint that bad. More petty problems = I think I listen to people. When someone has something to say - especially if it's serious! I always try to understand them and see what's really going on. I wish that when I listened, when I understand and try to make my case that who ever was doing the talking would do the same. I thought there was an unsaid mutual agreement. I was very wrong. My parents think I shouldn't see Ry unless his girlfriend is there - unless she is with us and watching over out every move. We don't want *Natasha* doing something with Ryan that we'll all infer virile young men and women do together... I should understand that Cindy doesn't want me around her new boyfriend and if I were a normal girl I would understand that ~ and damn it why can't I just hate him and curse his name to all the fires of hell like ANY NORMAL ex-girlfriend would do. Can't I understand that? ... ...well...yah, I can. I understand that perfectly. I told Ryan yesterday that he is probably making Cindy upset by hanging out with me. NO AND SORRY... but ~ I'm not normal. Excuse me if I'd understand that my current love affair is friends with his ex. Sure I'd be upset if he had to hang out with her every single day and broke dates with me and was sleeping at her house and eating dinner with her family all the time... but do you see what I'm getting at here? I don't do these things with Ryan, maybe, just maybe I might talk to him on the phone every once in a while, hang out every now and then. I do the same with all my friends. I've spoken more with Christian or Elise or just about anyone else than Ryan. I don't dislike Cindy. I've been pressuring Ryan to let me meet her! She likes Erasure! one of my favorite bands!!! I thought we just get along, Ryan said not yet, it's to weird... That's just me being 'unnormal' again I guess. Well for all my abnormalities my parents won't let me hang out with Ry unless Cindy is there. Ryan has told me she doesn't like me, which probably means she doesn't want to meet me. I've wanted to meet her a while... *lol* I wanted to warn her about 'Ryan' quirks so she'd be prepaired! She'd have someone to complain too and that person would know exactly what she was talking about. So if she never wants to meet me, I'll never hang out with Ryan again. *lol* and I told myself this blod was not going to get personal. Well I might not have posted this except for I wanted Ryan to read this and he doesn't call me back and I thought maybe he might go online...
*yawn* Ryan burned me 14 cds. I stole the 15th from him. Having this much new music to listen is blowing my gray matter clear into outer space. I’m not quiet sure I can call it new – I’ve heard it all before, what’s changed is that now I OWN it. I got Pink Floyd; The Format; Our Lady Peace; Eels; Lisa Loeb; The Weakerthans; and Bright Eyes. I have a nice Eels shirt and every time I wear this – all I get is “You must really like eel, wow you eat eel?” Yes I eat eels. I eat them all up actually. My coffee smells so good. Coffee gives a lot of people the gitters. Not me. It just tastes really good… My mother has drunk coffee her whole life. Puertorican coffee. (The kind the Pope gets imported cause that’s all he drinks!) Did you know that my family comes from the sugar cane capital of the world? In the middle of town square is a bronze statue of what looks like a migrant worker cutting sugar cane, ‘cept it ain’t no migrant worker. I’m from Puerto Rico by the way. I’d like to learn to be more concise, but I have to much shit to say! I’d like to grab my dictionary and look up a new word for the day but I’m too damn lazy to get off my ass and get it. *lol* I’d like to do a lot. I have to make a shirt today. I’ve got new black and white shirts – virgins just waiting for me to make a bad perverted analogy. I’ve got these lovely lyrics I’d like to make into shirts – if I didn’t look like a damn lesbian I might use these lyrics for my shirts. ‘cause I like…birds. Where as Christian is suppose to be writing – I’m not suppose to be! What the hell am I doing? Where as Jeremy is suppose to be acting – I’m not. Ryan, recording; Anthony, directing; Heather, writing; Akiba, creating; (I’m glad I surround myself with creative talent.) I know I’m suppose to be doing something creative and wonderful - *lol* I better go do it. I thought of another Queegueg shirt. SAVE THE WHALES! COLLECT THE WHOLE SET! Then all the incarnations of the logo whale. Oh and yesterday I made homemade, all natural dog treats. And all my dogs actually ate them! (I cut them out in the shapes of stars…*grin*)
I have to admit it. I really don’t like bugs. ~I did have to learn how to pick up those mealworms to feed my turtles. ~ This morning, Ryan calls me. He can’t take a shower cause there’s a spider in his tub. He hasn’t been able to take a shower in that bathroom for days… that’s how long it’s been there. I told him to take a box, a container – something – scoot the eight legged terror into the box with a broom and let it out into the free world. He couldn’t. I have to admit – I really dislike roaches if I saw one I’d probably make someone else kill it. There are fifty thousand million billion of those things. Even after nuclear war those bastards will be going strong. I need a guy that can kill a cockroach....!!! But usually, most spiders I can deal with.
Watched Simple Irresistible. I love cheesy. Like Water For Chocolate - naked people on horses. I liked it but I hated it. SI I mean. It's about my two favorite things. Magic. Food. I got to the point where Sarah Michelle Geller was kissing Sean Patrick Flannery and they were floating. Like I said. I love floating. I adore floating. My brother walked in and saw Sean freaking out about it. "I'd love that!" Floating? "Hell yah, if my girlfriend could make me float..."...then he walked out of the room. There's also this thing they do with about twelve mirrors. You could see them dancing. Twelve of them. Imagine if you had twelve of your favorite person. As I grin from ear to ear I can say that was for Christian and Elise! For everyone else too, but mostly them... I just realized it was about my three favorite things. Magic. Food. Love. and not in that order.
Gozilla and myself! She likes to lick the world...
You've gone over your blogging minutes this month..... Okay – the further adventures of *Natasha’s* obvious non-ability to flirt. It’s so sad. There I was at the Florida Mall. It was a tad busy, guys were there that didn’t have girls attached at the hip. Where was I? I happened to be staring at the damn FLOOR! I wasn’t looking up to show off these big brown eyes – OH NO! – I was looking down… what nice shoes you have, nice socks, shoes, shoes… oooh sandles. What the hell is my problem? Oh yah, did I mention I was at the Florida Mall, and and and – while I was there… I was shopping at what I like to call “skinny stores.” Abercrombie and Fitch, American Eagle… even a little Hot Topic… I find this type of shopping wonderful and extraordinary. Granted I’m still not exactly one of those skinny skinny girls…. yet. Mwaaahaaahaaahaa……. and we’ll all float on okay…….. the strange thing about it is actually finding clothes that fit you, look good, and you want to wear them. Have you ever tried looking for fat people clothes ~ you might as well give up, grab the muumuu, and tattoo ‘feed me’ to various visible parts of your person. Since I was 16 – since I was 16…. I believe it was about two weeks before I was diagnosed with lupus I was shopping at 5-7-9… I had bought a brown sundress. Very plain. A medium blue big flower short dress. Very busy. You loose weight and become perpetually COLD!
I’m very into lyrics. …went to the porch to have a thought….you still got your words you still got your friends……my thoughts were so loud…and we’ll aLl fLoAt On OkAy…… Modest Mouse likes to float. I like that. I really like that. Ryan once asked me, “Who pays attention to the lyrics first?” I do. But I love sha do’s and la la la’s. Clapping. Who knows why I like clapping. (Maybe it’s a left over Sesame Street thing?) This morning I woke up with the worlds smallest mohawk. After chemo it’s exciting to think you have enough hair for a mohawk. It looks freak’n hysterical. After chemo is the best time in a persons life. You really find out, you know… your heart is truly full of hope, the actual sensation. I’m going to get better. It’s a lot like falling in love. Sun: 1. self-luminous gaseous sphere about which the earth and other planets revolve and which furnishes light, heat, and energy for the solar – whoa… I did not just hear that….if lifes not beautiful without the pain well I just would rather never ever see beauty again…. Oh my little mice… why would you say that…..no no no no no no no…. *sigh* system: it is the star nearest star nearest the earth 2. any star that is the center of a planetary system 3. something like the sun as in warmth, brilliance, splendor, ect. It’s also a type of plant, a type of hemp. Star: 1. any of the luminous or self-luminous heavenly bodies seen as points of light in the night sky 2. a conventionalized flat figure having (usually five or six) symmetrical projecting points, regarded as a representation of a star in the sky 3. any mark resembling such a figure, often used as an award, symbol of rank ect. 4. same as asterisk 5. regarded as influencing human fate or destiny. Did you know people used to think certain emotions came from your spleen? Ever read Spleen and Ideal? Damn… I can’t believe I forgot who wrote that! That’s why I bought Dead can Dance, it’s a band. When I went to go buy the cd I went home with two… Spleen and Ideal and Into the Labyrinth. They were sitting on the rack waiting for me. DCD named themselves after the instruments, they wanted to prove ‘dead’ instruments can still make people dance. When I really like the lyrics and the music – I make music videos for the song… my own secret music videos. There all in storyboard form. I was the layout editor for my elementary school journal, literary collection – same for freshman year in college. HAPPY BIRTHDAY ELISE!!!
... let's tune out by turn'n on the radio! So I was going to purchase a Format shirt - support my new music - I was sad. No 'girl cut.' I'm sick of having to wear guys attire. Even when I make shirts - I have to buy boys t-shirt packages - okay sure - the breasts look awesome in them BUT the girl cut helps the waistline. After being sick for so long - after... things...

Here we are, trying to plan a party. When I plan a fiesta I try to go all out with the little money I have. I notice the least money I have the more creative I get. My littlest sister Laura is turning 18. Never mind how old I feel ~ I want her to have a great time. We, myself and two more sisters, are in charge of preparations for this historic event. Food, friends, music, movies, and party favors! What the hell do 18 year olds want in a party favor? I’m 24 and I love cheep plastic. ‘can’t help it, I guess. I was going to get these cute little watercolor paint sets – my other sister said they wouldn’t like them… the mini UNO was too expensive. I adore ‘mini!’ I’m so ready to throw this party, some people seem a little less than excited. We’re going to have a scrapbook table so everyone who goes can fill out a page so she can remember this little lovefest. Neon and music. She (Little Laura) also wants checkered. HELP THE FORMAT IS STUCK IN MY HEAD ~ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I didn’t realize I liked music this much. I use my mothers laptop to write, pop in a cd, type away. I’m beginning to notice the word ‘float’ in all my favorite songs. I can’t help it! I was cleaning out my stuff the other day and I found a black film container, it sounded like a maraca. Okay so what the hell is in this? Beads. Queequeg went to the Sarasota Film festival. Jeremy took apart a necklace he had – I took the extra beads. A space shuttle had went down and he made a shirt. He and Christian were really depressed about it. Ryan got drunk. Anthony’s car got broken into. Everybody loved Queequeg. Some random girl bought someone a drink. Chris met us over there. We weren’t all staying in the same place. Jeremy bought a box of sugar-free cookies and ate them in Ry’s car. I was sitting in crumbs for a week. Just so these Moby Dick boys know ~ I may not be dating Ryan but that doesn’t mean you’ve lost a cheerleader! Maybe my next shirt should be ‘queegueg groupie.’ But I still like ‘save the whales, collect the whole set’ with all the incarnations of the logo….
Laura's party... the 28th. 11am to 3pm.... everyone is invited... lots of free food! My house (remember it's in St Cloud!) She'll be 18... my littlest sister, goodness....
I’m awesomely lucky. At this particular moment, no worries. None. It’s Sunday morning. I think my dad is home, but he’s sleeping. I do have a lot of things to do. I’ve tons of things most people would tell me to worry about. But it’s all future happenings anyway. My family is getting tired of the tipidy-clakity of computer keys and what they call my ‘whiny rock.’ They call it other things but I can’t hear them - by that point I’ve plugged in my head phones. Besides – At least I’m alone. Bright Eyes can whine and dine me. Drink me. I’m full of coffee! It’s great to have a big family, just – not all the time. If you’ve ever read the Weezie at books… I read them sitting and waiting at Virgin. I like their world. Not literary genius, maybe the whiny rock of paperbacks. I just remembered – today is the Cure concert. Break a leg, Robert!
Yale gave George W. Bush an honorary law degree. Now he’s an honorary lawyer, the same way he’s an honorary president. - Letterman Moving forward. Boy. Okay. I love horror movies and now I have to see Exorcist: the beginning and the Village, though the later doesn’t strike me as a horror flick just cause it looks like one in the commercials and it’s M.Night… my lover…. Two, I ‘officially’ am going to Atlanta Bread to shop for men. Nextly – if I’m paying does some one want to take me shopping cause I think I need help. Today I had money and fit into a size 12 pair of pants… I have not fit into this fantasy in a coons age. Shopping was such a pleasure. I used to run around the Mall *wishing* Now – I don’t. BUT BUT BUT ~ I didn’t know what to buy… I feel like now I have this *mission* to change my look and my life! It’s a fantastic mind fuck. I’m so out of the “loop.” This is ME! T-shirt and jeans… bad t-shirts bad jeans, really bad. Guys clothes galore… Now I have a few skirts, a couple girlie cut T’s, my shoes, my really really cool shoes (with a cherry on top!) Now….NOW I’m into buying a jacket (just ask Christian the importance of a good jacket.) Nice clothes – I need stuff to go out in – be the muse I was meant to be. I’m in the process of making my own backpack cause I have my green one with the angel wings proudly sporting a flex of plaid explaining ‘real men wear kilts’, add a pin suggesting that I float along with the faeries and another to comment that I do listen to the Cure… delightful, but I want a smaller one. Anyway, anyone wanna shop?
*comfort* Back in my element – adjust adjust – I’ll get there again anyway. My element is wind anyway, I used to live in the Windy city, lucky me… movement. So I alight onto the land of surreal dreams and bona fide fuck ups. Lucky me. And all I wanted to do today was rant about fat baseball players. Baseball and hockey tastes good. Maybe I’ve had to much baseball, to much of a good thing? But didn’t those boys used to be skinnier? Old school please stand up! Wrigley Field rocks my world. Fat baseball players, the fatter the wife the skinnier the trophy girlfriend. I don’t care if they can still play – damn fatso, you have maybe THE greatest “American” job… SO GET TO WORK. You never see fat astronauts. If you wanna get fat – become a director – then you can be any size you want without ridicule. What little boy doesn’t go to his father and say “I wanna be a baseball player.” Okay so maybe some of them say ‘I wanna dress baseball players,’ either way!... I wanted to be a baseball player! I played pitcher and catcher. I wasn’t very good but I practiced ~ I got to play at Wrigley! I’ve seen some larger players make amazing catches, plays that I’ll never be able to imitate, homeruns I’ll never dream of – but have some pride. Wasn’t the Babe rather large? Maybe I shouldn’t be complaining. It just doesn’t make sense to me? Baseball players, astronauts, filmmakers, though I’m beginning to thing Australia/New Zealand is catching up. (And yes I know India makes way more movies than we do but not the same caliber, thank you very much!) Cartoonist? To regional. President? To puppeteered. The only other great American profession is… carpetbagger. Cowboy?... Football player maybe… none seem to be dominated by the female of the species, shock shock horror horror shock shock horror! The only great American profession for women is First Lady! And what will happen to that one when we get a woman president? By the way, any guy laughing out there… if it weren’t for your mother carrying you around for nine months where would you be – so unless you’re a test tube baby – and even then they still use an egg somewhere in the process. Happiness overwhelms my life every day. (Cause I know I’m right!) I was watching a ball game, just shortly – theory testing. Goodness – I love to babble.
I don't suggest long term hospital stays for anyone...
There are ghosts in my hospital room. I can hear them. When I close my eyes I can feel them standing in my personal space. Damn rude ghosts… Four days of watching T.V. to the point of shrinking my already small brain even further than half of our American population. Sad sad sad state of affairs. I have the Chicken Pox. BUT ~ as I was watching the news, Websters’ has a new dictionary! They were saying some of the new words to the English language but I’m pretty sure they were just slang. I’m excited about this new edition. My mom has an older one with pages that are made of a light paper, great definitions. We got a newer model – maybe – six years ago. I need a really good thesaurus. A few more months and I can go back to school. (I think.) I also think I’m going to have to pay for my own college this time. I have this underlying quote I heard melded to the left side of my brain, just above slumber – “Hi! I have a college degree, would you like fries with that!” Oh yah, I’m in the hospital with the Pox. I’m very ichy. I have painkillers on tap so it’s not to bad. I’m hooked up to these cute machines that don’t like to stop beeping, they must be communicating to each other. I haven’t called anyone to tell them – I feel like I bother people with all my damn sicknesses as it is. What’s one more? Really? Okay so boredom has kicked in but I’m mostly just extraordinarily tired cause you never get any sleep in the hospital. *blah* I’m going to sleep - ! Just in case I've see you in the last couple days - I hope you've had the Pox... if not I'm really sorry, wanna share a room?
What happens when there’s nothing more to say? I reiterate the facts in more and more elaborate words. No matter – you still won’t be able to get through. Life gives you so many wonderful choices. Should I? Maybe not? But it tastes so good… and you decide. The decision isn’t the important thing in the sentence. You are. I think I’m pretty forgiving. I think I listen and understand. I don’t think I hate anything really… but I *really* dislike it when people don’t take responsibility for their own actions. From small stupid bullshit, a purchase, maybe the wrong type of flour; this disresponsibility grows into not going after your happiness. If you bought the wrong type of flour – next time write it down! Don’t rely on the person who goes with you to the market to remember YOUR groceries. Then, life goes on. Being happy is very important to me. I don’t have time for anger, resentment, jealousy and other such nonsense! Let me be surrounded with freedom, beauty, truth, and love. (Baz has it so right!) How do people drag the muck into there lives and not want to soar brilliantly through the clouds? I understand a little depression every once in a while, things just aren’t going your way, ect… even deep depression – but for that someone better have died…(only in a few cases do I accept a broken heart.) I’m just tired of feeling guilty for shit I didn’t do. Get off your ass and find what your looking for, do what your suppose to do, be who your suppose to be – no one can do it for you! You have to do it for yourself! You can live vicariously up to a point… Take responsibility for yourself. Live life. Be happy. Everyone deserves to be happy. EVERYONE!
shopping again today - for my sisters - I still have no jacket. to small. to big. or just not cool enough... I'm moments away from watching Kill Bill II. I've purchased chips and dip for the occasion. Quentin....yum.... ...I'm really beginning to like this Uma. Now Angelina I loved right off the bat... but Uma's growing on me... nice uneventful day. walk walk walking. more flirting fun - it's a shame that's not what I'm looking for.
when i go to sleep at night - i dream. apparently not many 'adults' do. of everyone. of everything. im a prophet. im mad. simply. Yesterday I went to see The Village. M.Night, if you ever need a mistress - though I know you'd NEVER cheat on your wife. I got all gussied up. I got "checked out." I checked out a few muffins - I know, I know... save some room for later...*wicked wicked grin*....(when YOU spend years of being sick and average and metamorph into a sex goddess ~ you can tell me to calm down...) People talk about these dreams where their back in school - naked. I have those except I'm not naked, I'm just never wearing pants... ever. I was back in the fourth grade, Mr. VanSteen was at the chalkboard. And there I was with no pants. Essay time, and I'm the dork that likes them. Students take one and pass it back... I've given you a few resource pages about the topic and... begin... I leaf through pages about satellite systems, the internet, how books are made, magazine clippings about the same, I remember looking out the window and seeing other kids playing in the school yard. Your topic: What is the best type of communication? Between two people, human contact is a glorious declaration of our abilty to communicate. ...I turned that in... And... I don't intend on waking up, but I was thinking about putting on some pants.
1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when women make love they produce amounts of the hormone estrogen, which makes hair shine and skin smooth 2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses the pores and makes your skin glow. 3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that romantic dinner. 4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers! (unless ya kinky) 5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases endorphins into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and leaving you with a feeling of well-being. 6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called pheromones. These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy! 7. Sex is the safest tranquilliser in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM. 8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up. 9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain. (guess that ever safe "not tonight honey I have a headache" won't cut it anymore...unless u guys are into the hard-f*cking) 10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a natural antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.
Okay so Atlanta Bread… cute guys and the old lady version of Christian – Ha! I completely had forgotten about that and my sister started playing with her boy toy’s digital camera. This older lady was in A.B. and taking digital photos from a little table while her husband carried the food over I thought… hummm… I wonder if Christian does that... Photographers do it in dark rooms!
When I cross people on the street, sit next to them on the bus – my mind wanders into little stories about how they got there and where they are going. Some people don’t let you imagine. Some people smell like 76 open bottles of beer on the wall and slur up to you telling you a nice little spanish girl shouldn’t be hanging out with a white girl. I’m so thankful that only happened once. So a few people win the lottery, others learn to love, little boys get puppies for Christmas. (Most of my stories are *really* sugar coated!) *blech* I’m not wasting my time on filth and anger… Little stories, poetic lyrics, love triangles (though I don’t like to be *in* them,) haunted houses and full lives – I love ‘em. Confidence, don’t mistake that one for ego. Appetizers, intelligent conversation, and my newest penchant strawberry wine! It’s not babble… my mind just likes to wander. And all I wanted to say was maybe I like lyrics because I like those poetic stories – brevity set to music. Something I can’t do, and I don’t want to.
I pick and choose my words... then computers EAT THEM!
And after it was all over she walked into her messy kitchen and... made macaroni and cheese... That was a dreadfull storm and as I sat on my laundry room floor hopeing all my cats were away from the windows all I could think of was, 'damn is it ever going to END!' I adore rainy weather. I love to dance in it. I love to sleep, there may not be a better lullaby. But ~ this was bad. Knowing me I wouldn't have taken it as seriously if my family wasn't there freaking out about my reading on the couch WAY TO CLOSE TO THE WINDOW!!! I'd take a snowstorm anyday. No electricity for two days. No AC... plenty of SWELLTERING HEAT though... I couldn't sleep. I did almost finish with my book. (I read them I don't write them.) My sisters and I were going to have a Boggle game or two... it was too hot to think! My brain is still a bit singed... I do rather want to finish the pages I have left... then I'm going to rent Needful Things and see how different it is from what I read. I am really excited about going to see Garden State. I've discussed this a little with Elise and I'm going to have to start stalking Zach Braff. Z N - think about it!
Marblehead, 2003 Dude, the jerk hut is not reopening for the summer. I'm moving to Florida.
It could just as easily have taken place anywhere in the United States because I was driving my Jetta on the right side of the road. But in my dream last night, I was driving to London's Heathrow Airport at night (in unusually light traffic, I might add) when men standing along the road started flashing lights at the passing cars. I vividly remember the lights looked like a smaller, two-light version of a traffic signal, only white. When other cars stopped in the middle of the road and their drivers got out of the cars, I did the same. I asked someone what was going on and a man told me we were to kill the lights of our cars and lie down on the ground. He said it was a signal from the blackout days World War II to alert citizens that a bombing was imminent. Lights should be doused and people should take cover. While I understood we were in the middle of some sort of terror attack on London, I wasn't sure why we were being instructed to lie down, exposed, in the middle of the highway, but I did so. The first aircraft was a helicopter, which I saw rise from between two sections of the highway and explode. It wasn't close enought to me to be a danger. Then second helicopter lifted up and exploded. The third was a small, commuter-sized airplane, which lifed off over the highway then exploded. Again, not close enough to be a danger to me or the others lying on the highway, but frightening. While at the time I didn't know what sort of damage the explosions created or how many people might have been killed, the size of each aircraft made me wonder if these particular terrorists might not have been the most intelligent of the lot. After the plane explosion, I stood up and said that I wasn't going to lie out in the open anymore. While others around me protested, others followed me to the edge of the road. We crawled down an embankment and ended up hiding beneath rows of grapevines in a vineyard, where we found ourselves among a group of United States soldiers. They told us we shouldn't be there, but took us to a shelter where we stayed the rest of the night. Then I woke up.
Most days I spend with Caroline are fun, and today was no exception. It began with us jamming to Bob Marley and the Wailers "Legend" on the way to the Westlake soccer tournament. The tournament started yesterday, but I couldn't go because I had to work, so one of the other girl's mother took Caroline along. They won one game and lost the other yesterday. So, now that you're up to speed, the team lost their first game this morning. That wasn't such a bad thing, but what was a bad thing was the mother of one of our players who was under the impression that she was the coach. She yelled instructions, and loudly pinpointed everything the girls did wrong, even when they did what she had loudly proclaimed earlier would be the "right" thing to do. I tried to be tactful, but I told her that A. the girls are too busy playing to listen to her, and B. all parents should get out onto the field sometimes and experience what it feels like to have people coming at you because you have the ball, and then try to dump it off to a teammate before someone steals it. You know what she said? "I know they're not listening, but it makes me feel better." Dumb bitch. During the break between games, Caroline and I went to McDonald's for lunch, where we OD'd on Happy Meals just to get the mini plushie Neopets -- her latest favorite thing. From there, we went to Borders, where I picked up a copy of "Wicked" by Gregory Maguire. I'll let you know how it is. After that, we stopped at the tournament HQ to buy Caro a tournament T-shirt before heading to the fields for the second game. They lost, but were appeased by the participation trophies they received. When the tournament ended, Caroline and I went to the Build-a-Bear Workshop, where she selected, stuffed, groomed, named and dressed in soccer attire, a Border Collie plushie, aptly named "Mia." I bought Scott a pair of jeans at Aeropostale (with the promise of cutting off the label if they fit), but they are too tight for his fat little ass, so back they go. Mexican dinner, stop by mom's to tell her about the tournament and then home. One of the neat things from the tournament was a tradition of teams trading patches after each game. Because we're just a little ghetto team, our girls didn't have patches to trade, but came home with patches from two of the teams they played. So, now I'm off to sew them on. And if you happen to be wondering what I'm planning for tomorrow, the answer is nothing . Absolutely nothing. Happy Memorial Day.
Guess what I'm doing today. Sandusky 2003
I'm really glad during the graduation I covered this morning for the paper, none of the three valedictorians uttered the words "the best four years of our lives." Oh, sure, we got leaving footprints, embarking on a journey, making the world a better place and using education as a map to success. Fortunately, however, we didn't have to hear about how high school is the best time of your life. Because those of us who have been there, done that know better. College beats high school hands down, but that's still not the best time of your life. Your wedding day... even with a bad perm and a dress you would never choose again, if given the choice, wedding days still eclipse high school. Buying your first house... pretty damn cool, too. But nothing, absolutely nothing can compare with the moment you greet your first child. When it happens, both of you are tired and crying, neither particularly attractive... but that moment, for me, was the best time in my life. Remember high school fondly for they were, indeed, very good years. And that sunscreen tip? Yeah.
Sandusky 2004
I wonder if I've become jaded with interviewing celebrities. Or maybe it's just that I think T0dd R*ndgren is as boring as he thinks I am.
If I had $100 that I didn't have to use for bills or groceries, I would buy, 100 bucks worth of: Candles, in all the sizes and scents I like. CDs or DVDs that I've been meaning to buy. Flip flops, in every color imaginable. Tickets to see 311 this summer. Girly stuff. Lotions, gels, hair thingies, sparkly stuff. Beer. Lots of beer. From all over the world. A GPS for geocaching. Books. stuff from IKEA. It doesn't matter what stuff. Just stuff. It's all good. I'm sure there are more things I would buy, but that's a start. What would you buy?
Sandusky 2003
Good night's sleep. Good breakfast. Good weather. Good mood. Good day at work on the forecast. Good hair day. Goodbye (for now).
Sandusky 2004
I have a confession to make. Today I'll be wearing the same pants to work that I wore yesterday. I hate doing it because it makes me look like a hick, but these are the only pants I have that when I look in the mirror I don't want to cry. I started eDiets yesterday because I just can't go it alone, but that doesn't help today when I look in my closet and nothing fits.
Once every 17 years. Bah. That's nothing . I scoff at cicadas. You want a formidable insect opponent? Try this: And not just every 17 years. No. How does every year grab you? All winter the larve bide their time until spring. Then they develop into 5,324,946, 295 mayflies, which fly out of Lake Erie, have sex, then find a surface to latch onto. Cars, streets, trees, dogs, little old ladies... you name it, they'll stick to it. After that, they die and dry up, leaving their exoskeleton still clinging. One year it was so bad, they had to break out snow plows to shovel the carcasses away. Cicadas? You people have it made.
Put-in-Bay 2003
I was going to clean the house today. I'd planned it around lunch with Mom. But from Damon's we went to the library for a couple of videos for her to show the little kids in her school library. Then we parked downtown and poked around in the shops. In the antique store, we talked about how when I was little, I saved up my money and went to Grant's department store to buy Mom an awful Carnival glass (or perhaps Carnival glass-like) bowl that looked like half a watermelon with legs. In retrospect, the thing was positively hideous, but I remember how beautiful I thought it was so I had to buy it for her. We stopped at the coffeehouse to buy muffins for the kids, went to the furniture store and she told me about how one empty store front used to be the finest dress shop in town. Some of the windows still have displays from the shop after the finest dress shop in town, but nothing has been in there for at least 25 years. When my stepdad ran for state representative in the early 80's he rented the old store for his campaign headquarters. While we were supposed to be licking envelopes, my stepsister and I found old lipsticks, manequins and wigs in the backroom. Mom and I picked up the kids from their schools, so by the time she dropped us off at home it was nearly 3 p.m. I managed to get some of the trim painted in the living room this morning, as well a load of dishes, a load of laundry and some vacuuming done. But even if I'd done nothing but spend time with my mom, I'd call it a success. ... I spoke today with the managing editor of the Florida newspaper to which I sent my resume. She said she had not started going through the stack of resumes on her desk, but she remembered my name. I'm not sure what that means, but I'll take it as a good sign, k?
My life is just too boring to write about. Sunburn. New capri pants. Skate competition photos coming soon to a website near you. Today I have to find an auto insurance company who will allow us to pay in installments. See, our current company used to allow us until we had a bit of trouble and couldn't keep up with the payments. So because we had trouble paying, their wisdom said the best way to get the money out of us is, naturally, to make us pay the premium in full. Right. If I can't pay the installment, how do you expect me to pay in full? The last time, we made our children eat gruel and scrub the kitchen floor for six months so we could pay the bill. I just threw that scrubbing part in because I didn't feel like doing it. Don't tell them, mmkay? This just in: It's cool. We can go on an automatic payment plan. Whew. So, now it's time to get back to my boring life. Catch ya later.
I spent the entire morning at the soccer fields. Both kids' teams won, with Scott scoring 3 of 5 goals for his team and Caroline stellar at defense for her team. Rock on, kiddos! From there we went downtown for a skateboard competition. Scott wasn't competing, but it was so cool to watch. I took a whole roll of shots on the Fed and probably half a roll on the lomo. So stay tuned.
Cedar Point, 2003
I had a dream last night that Phil, Caroline and I were riding in his van. He'd put it on autopilot and we were all sitting in the back, talking. At one point, I realized we seemed to be going at a rate of speed that was too fast for a city street. I looked forward and I noticed that there were flares in the road and a barricade on the other side of the rapidly approaching intersection. On the other side of the barricade was a construction crane that we would surely hit if we didn't stop or turn. I ran up to the driver's seat, but just as I dropped into the seat, the van slammed head-on into the crane. I woke up just at that instant. ... It was confirmed to me today that 13-year-old boys are, in fact, morons. I called the guidance counselor at the local junior high school to find out when honors night will be. Typically, I send a photographer to the event and then we run the list of award winners afterward. The counselor was perplexed, wondering why I hadn't received the event handout that was sent home with all the students, one of whom is my son. Hellooo, we're talking about 13-year-old boys here. Particularly my 13-year-old boy who forgets permission slips, gym shorts, lunch tickets and school pictures. Talking further with the counselor, however, I know why Scott conveniently "forgot" about honors night. Students are not allowed to wear jeans or shorts to the event. They must dress up, which for Scott is akin to having his fingernails pulled out with pliers. But, this is one of those times when it really sucks to have a mother who is a reporter. Not only do I know about honors night, but I know about the dress code. And there ain't no gettin' out of it. So how are you today?
I watched "Mona Lisa Smile" tonight. I didn't love it, but I liked it. It does explain so much why my mother-in-law is the way she is. But the very best part of the film?

Key West, March 2004
The spiders were roused from their winter slumber this morning when I fired up the long-unused Nordic Track. Sorry, spiders, the scales tipped this morning at a weight I haven't seen in a very long time. A weight beyond the scope of my regular justification. "Oh, it's only X over my pre-London weight. I can lose that quick." Which, of course, I never do. But today's number was one that said (quite loudly, I might add) that if I don't modify my current behaviors I'll find myself back to my start weight, which was over 200 pounds. Frightening, sobering, motivating thought. Especially after finding a photo of myself at a pub in London. Certainly not the most flattering image of me ever (a warning for the harmful effects of too much Guinness at one sitting) but I was fit, damn it! So, spiders, this is your only warning. You'll have to find another home.
West Virginia I-77, February 2004
Ordinarily I wouldn't see 4 a.m. on a Monday morning when I have work in less than a handful of hours. I can only blame the Mexican food for part of that. Sitting here with nothing to do and hours in which to do it, I wrote a short story. I've e-mailed it to Bob -- He's shared his with me, so I wanted him to be the first to read mine -- and later I'll link to it here. After I've had some sleep.
I'm fairly certain that Mexican food is the Creator's way of punishing me for some past transgression. A sort of epicurean karma come back to get me. And every time I go for Mexican food I end up feeling this way. I just never learn.
For some reason the description on the DVD cover made me believe "Osama" would be the kind of film in which the downtrodden prevail. It is a beautiful film, but when it ends, that hope is summarily quashed.

Today I vacuumed enough dog wool from my bedroom carpet to clothe a small Third World country. I also discovered that said carpet is green. Who knew?
Mound Key, February 2004
After frozen pizzas, the kids and I watched "Master and Commander" on DVD. It was very well-done, but the doctor excepted, I didn't really warm up to any of the characters. Despite being a two-hour film, it didn't feel as if we had time to get to know and love them, even Russell Crowe's character. Afterward I watched "Love Actually," which, actually, also left me a little... lukewarm. The Colin Firth storyline was sweet and silly and worth a few warm fuzzies, but the rest not so much. Hugh Grant as PM was quite a stretch for the old imagination. And Alan Rickman's character was too grey for a guy who typically plays black or white. P.S. And this has nothing to do with either film... if you haven't tried the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, run out right now and get one. Those things are fan-fucking-tabulous!
Sandusky, March 2004
I'm not a big fan of cooking. No. That's not right. I love cooking. I adore cooking. I just hate washing up afterward, so I just try to avoid the whole thing completely. I also hate grocery shopping. But I've found a reason to do both: the new and improved world foods section at Kroger. Oh, I'm sure those fortunate enough not to live in East Bum Fuck (like me) might find my wide-eyed wonderment amusing. But until now the "ethnic" aisles at the local supermarkets around here have pretty much consisted of a few boxes of matzo balls, two dozen varieties of Old El Paso salsa and Kikkoman soy sauce, give or take a can of tripe and a tube of wasabi. At Kroger, though, we're talking a wide variety of stuff from all over the world. India, Japan, Scotland, France, Ireland, England, Italy, Jamaica, Germany, Turkey... I know I'm leaving some out. The best find, however, was: And you know what that means, don't you? English breakfast next weekend. My house. Be there or be square.
There is something wrong with the fact that it is 7 p.m. on a Friday and I am without beer. Off to remedy that situation right now.
Key West, March 2994 Hands down, this is the most fantastic car I've ever seen. I want one.
I was offered a job today that I really, really want. The problem (there's always a problem, isn't there?) is that I'd have to take about a $90/week pay cut... or find a part-time job to make up the difference. On the other hand, it has huge potential for job satisfaction. And this I know from first-hand experience. Not sure what I'm going to do, though.
... you scream. We all scream for ice cream. You'd scream too, if you ate as much ice cream as I did today. Scott, Caroline and I spent the entire day doing the grand tour of area ice cream shops for a story I'm doing for our FunC0ast tab, which runs on Fridays. At each place, we asked about the specialty or most popular item. We tried a banana split, peanut butter milkshake, C0bb's Cooler (which was a float made with slush), fresh strawberry sundae, orange/vanilla twist made with homemade orange sherbet, OSU Buckeye flurry, a Rocky Road cone and Flavor Blast ice cream cone (which is swirled with flavored syrup). We went to about 10 shops total, but could not bear to eat something at every place. There is, my friends, such a thing as too much ice cream. Miss Nesta is proving to be pretty good choice. She is still adjusting, so she hasn't said anything yet. But today she ventured from the highest perch to try a little of her fruit and vegetable seed mix. We're keeping her on top of the dresser in our bedroom, which provides a bit of seclusion, as well as keeps Sonic from sticking his big fat nose against her cage and scaring the bejezus out of her. I get the impression that once she warms up to her new surroundings and people, she's going to be a feisty little bird.
You know how I told myself that parakeets are messy little beasties? We know own two Australian Shepherds, a red betta called Aku and a little green budgie called Nesta. I so totally caved.
Caroline and I picked up some treats for the doggies today, as well as a toy rope for Hinckley. See, Sonic is a toy hog. He has two plush soccer balls, a purple racquetball and a plush Cookie Monster. Hinckley would play with the ball if Sonic didn't steal it. Consequently, Hinckley has been toy-less pretty much since we got Sonic. When we got home, Caroline took Sonic outside, while I played tug-o-war with Hinckley until he wore out. It didn't take very long. He's old and out of shape, kind of like me Phil. Heh. We also picked up a new betta fish with intentions of doing the betta vase thingies we'd done with Samurai Jack. But after reading on the 'net how it's really not a good environment for the fish, Caroline and I cleaned out an old goldfish bowl and are prepping it to be a new home for Aku. While at the pet supply shop, watched the parakeets playing. When we were dating, Phil and I had two, called Louie and Ziggy. Louie was a blue 'keet, named for my favorite college bar. Ziggy, a green bird, was named for Ziggy Marley. We gave the birds to a nice lady in Michigan, after we'd signed a lease on a rental house. As adorable as parakeets are, they are very messy little beasties. I really need to keep that in mind, since I was very tempted to take one home with me.
I ripped open the USPS package today in eager anticipation of the French Connection skirt I had every intention of wearing to work because it was just so darn khaki and cute. However, skirt is not quite what I would call it. Scrap of fabric with great big buttons that barely covers my ass is more like it. Needless to say, I will not be wearing the skirt to work anytime soon. Also disappointing was the French Connection polo shirt I ordered for Phil. It's everything the seller claimed it was. Unfortunately, Phil's body isn't.
It's difficult to maintain an interesting journal when you ain't got no drama, but I'm not going to write about work right now. Nor am I going to talk about other opportunities that may or may not be presenting themselves to me right now. But I can tell you that Phil is hating his boss right about now. What is it, asshole season?
Not sure if I should be proud or alarmed that I am remarkably adept at determining the difference between urlLink dog toys and marital aids .

You may or may not have noticed that I deleted a few recent entries. Call me paranoid, but I have this feeling that anything I say write, can and will be used against me. So, just for the record, everything is hunky and dory. And you can quote me on that.

I feel inordinately and strangely pleased that I managed to have a sexy dream last night that wasn't somehow interrupted by my husband. While I won't divulge the intimate details, the dream was about an old boyfriend, Brian. He was a basketball player more devoted to his sport than a relationship, but I was ass over elbows for that guy. So that made the dream particularly pleasant. Yay!

Caroline's Joke of the Day™: What is Snoop Dogg's favorite weather condition? . . . . . . . . . . . Drizzle!
Phil called a marina in Florida Wednesday that recently changed owners. He had a conversation with one of the women in the office, who told him they will be looking for a manager about six months from now. Do you know how perfect that would be? We'd have time to get the house finished, on the market and get our stuff packed up. Phil's going to call the owner and fax his resume, so pray to the diety of your choice and keep your fingers crossed, k?
Phil said last night I was asleep with my arm stretched to the night table, my fingers tapping on the tabletop. He said I did it for about 20 minutes. I wonder what was up with that. ... Yesterday morning, Phil was awakened by some guys on a cell phone who said they found our phone number scrawled on a piece of paper, at the local amusement park's wave-action pool. One guy told him, "You shouldn't leave your phone number at Soak City." Still half-asleep, Phil thanked him, hung up the phone and went back to sleep. When he really woke up, he found the number on our caller ID and called the guys back. They were heading home after spending Tuesday at the amusement park. While in the wave-action pool, they found the piece of paper in the water. It had been folded about eight times. The one guy said they found it strange to find a piece of paper with nothing but a phone number on it. So they called. We were baffled. Who would have taken our phone number to Cedar Point? Who did we give our number to recently? We couldn't come up with a reasonable explanation. So we assumed that the water had smudged the numbers, making it look like our phone number. At lunch yesterday, we explained the mysterious events to the kids. After considering, Scott announced that he had the answer to the mysery. As it turns out, he wrote our phone number on a piece of paper for one of his best friends, who had previously lost the number. And later that day, Brian went to Soak City. ... Yes, indeed, my life is really really boring.

Sandusky 2003 I've probably shared this photo before in the old blog, but yesterday when my father-in-law was taking a picture of his four granddaughters it hit me again just how much this girl of mine blows me away.
Friday: Spent the entire night on the couch watching television and feeling sick. Saturday: Sent Scott off to Hoover Sailing Club for a regatta in the morning, then spent the rest of the day shopping with Caroline. I bought Phil a pastel lime green shirt and he liked it. Armageddon is sure to begin at any moment. Sunday: Slept until 4 a.m., played games on the computer until 7 a.m., went back to bed until noon. Still not 100%. Met my 4-year-old niece today for the first time. Brother-in-law has three daughters with three different women and is just beginning to have visitation time with the middle girl. She's a sweetie, but I expect today was really overwhelming for her. Bought the newest Starsailor album today, too. Two thumbs up. Now: Off to watch the rest of Amelie (again).
I left my flat iron plugged in for three days. Unfortunately, my ugly bathroom did not catch fire. Luden's Throat Lozenges were the perfect way to get away with eating candy at school. Sandals on a rainy day when you have a cold... not a good idea. When you tell your 13-year-old son that you "just bid on whatever jeans were sized 29x30 on eBay," you can get away with making him wear Lucky and Old Navy brands. What exactly is wrong with eating chips and sandwiches and Ramen noodles everyday for lunch? My son seems to think he has to have some variety at lunchtime. What does he think I am? A school cafeteria? I want to see The Chronicles of Riddick. Not because it looks interesting or because I'm a Vin Diesel fan. It's all about the Karl Urban, baby. Thanks to urlLink jennyj , I discovered urlLink Tube Gossip which made me laugh and laugh and laugh. I'm going home now. Catch ya later.
While I was home sick, I think I watched every decorating show known to man, including but not limited to: Decorating Cents, Design on a Dime, Surprised by Design, While You Were Out, Home to Go, Trading Spaces, Design Guys, Clean Sweep, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, Sensible Chic, Rally Round the House, Monster House and Outer Spaces. I'm pretty sure I now hold the equivalent of an associate's degree in Interior Decorating.
Against my better judgement, I came to work today. I still could use another day to recover, but I didn't want to push it with my boss. Everything was hunky and dory until a guy stopped in the lobby (note to self: never, EVER, answer a call from the lobby again) to show us a letter written by a Large Area Amusement Park (henceforth, LAAP) to outside marine contractors. LAAP will no longer allow outside contractors to service boats in the marina because LAAP has a service agreement with a Local Service Facilty (LSF, you get the idea) that gives LSF exclusive right to provide services at LAAP docks. Whether or not this is legal, ethical or just not very nice doesn't really matter. The issue I have is that Phil works for LAAP and is a former employee of LSF. Editor is satisfied that because lobby guy gave us the information, Phil should not suffer any repercussions. I hope she's right because tomorrow the story's going to have my byline on it. Oh, and by the way, I didn't get the city editor gig. I kinda expected I wouldn't and I'm not bothered that I didn't. I case you were wondering.
Ipswich, UK 2002
But don't think I'll be scarfing bon bons and playing Word Mojo. Well, okay, I might play Word Mojo, but the very idea of eating anything, much less bon bons, makes my stomach queasy.
I received a phone call last night from the city editor, wondering if I would be okay to come to work today because without my Campbell School story, they have no Sunday C-Cover. God forbid they don't have a Sunday C-Cover because I'm sick ! I told her that I was going to take half a sick day today and then go cover the last day of Campbell School. It's a historic old school that is closing after the last day of school today. But dammit, I'm sick. Vertical is not something I can accomplish for an extended period of time. I'm coughing my head off. My throat is swollen. And yet I feel guilty because without the story, the paper doesn't have a Sunday C-Cover. How is that my problem?!
According to urlLink this (thanks to urlLink seussie by the way), I resemble Ashley Judd, Julia Roberts and Mariah Carey. In a parallel universe, maybe. This one, not so much.
The worst thing about taking a sick day when you're actually sick is... well... being sick. It's different when I take a sick day when Caroline's sick. I can clean the house, snuggle with her on the couch, get a load of laundry done. But today, I don't feel like doing any of those things. Snuggling on the couch excepted. I slept until 10 a.m. and had some bizarre Nyquil-induced dreams that I don't really remember. I have vague memories of standing up to some Nazi-esque organization trying to hinder my freedom of religion... and hot boys. In the same dream. Not sure what that was all about, but I kinda liked it.
Key West 2004
We went to the new Japanese restaurant tonight for dinner and it was fantastic. The restaurant is well-decorated, the sushi was fresh and delicious and I was tempted to take the whole table home with me because it was just so pretty. What was surprising was how many familiar faces we saw. Most of them were waiting for hibatchi, but it was a nice turnout for the first night. Because the closest Japanese restaurant is nearly an hour a way, it was so refreshing to leave the house 15 minutes before our reservation time, enjoy a leisurely meal with friends and not have to worry about a long drive home. Scott sailed in a regatta today in Toledo, where they finished third in the Thistle class. There were only four boats, but it still meant hardware. And since the sailing club is called Jolly Roger, he brought home a great third place flag with a skull and crossbones. I happened to drive by a garage sale today after soccer and on a whim decided to see what they had. Most of it was crap, but I found a retro-looking barstool that has chrome legs, a slatted wooden back and vinyl covered seat. The seat and foam beneath were ripped, but I'm going to go all Trading Spaces on it and recover the seat with some funky fabric. Eventually.
Loved it. Loved it. Loved it. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but my only disappointment was that something from the book didn't make it into the film. Still... see above. I think I enjoyed the film most out of everyone in our household, including Caroline, who has been anticipating it for weeks.
Sandusky, 2004 The young maid from Schwabia sat atop a ride at Cedar Point for years, enduring with a smile the crude comments and snickering about her ample bosom. She retired two years ago to a home for aging carousel horses.
Randy and I had a groove. He'd play the straight guy, I'd be the sarcastic one. He'd give the opportunity, I'd take the jab. Our listeners ate it up. And I know they'd love the whole Bob Newart-ness of me taking the job of the girl who replaced me. The timing is off. The staffing at the station has been slashed, leaving no money for me. Then there's the whole moving to Florida thing. The way my luck works, I'd get a call from a Florida newspaper the week after I accepted the morning show gig. It just doesn't feel right. But damn do I want it.
In my e-mail today: "Geeeet A Biggeeer Coock " Apparently that cooking gig didn't quite pan out for the Swedish Chef.
I received an e-mail this morning from my former on-air partner at the radio station. The girl who replaced me is leaving and he wanted to know if I'd be interested in coming back. She told him I might be. I am. I really, really am. The problem is that I'd have to take a pay cut to do it. That is worrying. Not because I think I'm worth more. I am. . I just can't afford it. Clyde says I should just get a part-time job on the side to supplement. Maybe doing something else I really love. That's not a bad idea. In fact, it's a great idea. I want to consider this. I'm going to consider this.
I was going to regale you with tales of how I exfoliated my feet last night while watching the "What Not to Wear" marathon on TLC, but really... how boring would that be? Instead, to anyone tempted to lean over to a friend and whisper -- behind the shade of a hand -- that my trousers look a little bulgy around my hips today: I already know. But if I had to wear those stone-colored capri pants one more day, there's no telling what types of unspeakable horrors I may have committed. Besides, I'm wearing a low-cut shirt today, which leads me to Trish Fashion Tip #1 : Dazzle 'em with boobage and they'll forget all about the saddlebags.
So the weather music bed started playing at 6:50 a.m. and it occurred to me that I have no idea how to go live. Thank God for voice tracking.
Mimi was right. I loved Cold Mountain. I am not a Nic0le Kidman fan, so her presence in the film bugged me a little. I can see why she'd have been chosen for the role, however. She's got that delicate, pampered Ada look about her. I thought Jude Law was well cast, too. In any case, what had been a book that moved too slowly for my taste, turned out to be an excellent film.
Put-in-Bay 2004
Curses to fcuk for marking downthe skirt I want to what seems a very tempting £25. Add shipping and conversion at the current rate (about 55 cents), it would cost $63. Not so tempting anymore, huh? ::cue whining:: But I want that skirt! I need that skirt! Don't you want meto look good? Don't you care about me?::end whining:: I got that whine off a little boy at Perry's Cave last week. His mom had given him $5 to spend on anything in the gift shop. First he found some little trinket that fell in his price range, eagerly showing it to her. She told him he could afford it, but he wanted to go back and keep looking. Just sohe didn't miss the souvenir. You know how it goes. A few minutes later he came back and told her he found a vest that he really wanted. He told her the price was "six two five."She said it was too expensive. "Don't you want me to look good?" he asked. "Don't you careif your son looks nice?" He was smoooooth. I have to give the mom credit. She stood firm. Me? I'd have folded faster than a house of cards over $1.25. And I really do want that skirt.
Over the weekend I signed on for the Movie Pass at Blockbuster, which is similar to Netflix. While I don't get the films delivered directly to my door, the Blockbuster is less than a mile from my house on the road that goes right past my street. I'm not that lazy. So far I've seen: James and the Giant Peach - this was a Caroline pick that I'd seen in the theater with Scott when he was little. It's a family favorite and I just love Joanna Lumley as Aunt Spike. Starsky Hutch - I'm not a big fan of Ben Stiller, or Owen Wilson, for that matter. While I wouldn't say this was one of the best movies I've ever seen,when Snoop Dogg says, "Found your nine iron, bitch" and clocks Vince Vaughn with a golf club? I'm still laughing at that. 50 First Dates - I was surprised to find myself really liking this one. Adam Sandler was (oddly) endearing, Drew Barrymore was adorableand, of course, the soundtrack kicked ass. Bringing Down the House - When this movie came out, I found myself strangely attracted to it, but I didn't see it. My curiosity was piqued again when it first came out on DVD, but still I didn't see it. With it falling after 50 First Dates in the alphabetical layout at Blockbuster, I gave it a shot... and I liked it. Chasing Liberty - Anne Hathaway was successful with the regular girl becomes a princess thing in "Princess Diaries." Amanda Bynes was cute as a button being the American girl in London in "What a Girl Wants." Then it started getting out of control... Hillary Duff in Rome and Mandy Moore as the president's daughter in Prague. I'm sorry, but I just could not buy any guy, especially a secret service agent, falling for Mandy Moore's character after a couple of days. Tonight's movie is Cold Mountain, which Phil picked after having heard it was a Civil War movie. When I read the description that it's about a wounded soldier making his way back to the woman he loves, Phil decided he might not want to watch that after all. I'm not all that keen on it myself... so I'll let ya know.
Because urlLink Supa Jen said so, here's what I did on my summer vacation: Sunday: My father-in-law,brother-in-law, Caroline and I sailed over in the afternoon, arriving at urlLink Put-in-Bay about 4 p.m. After getting us secured to a mooring ball in the harbor, FIL and BIL caught the first ferry home, while Caroline and I got settled.We ran into Scott, who had sailed over with his teammates earlier in the day, at the urlLink yacht club . All the teams were there for introductions, instructions and dinner, so Caroline and Iate at urlLink The Boathouse before heading back out to the boat for the evening. Monday: While Scott was crewing aboard a urlLink Thistle in the urlLink I-LYA Junior Sail Regatta , Caro and I did the local history thing. See, PIB is steeped in family history for Phil's family. His great-granddad and two brothers were prominent islanders in the early days. Several of the family homes and businesses are still standing. So we visited the urlLink historical society ,rode our bikes around to see all the different buildings, to the cemetery and went up in urlLink Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial . From up there, we could see the different race courses set up between the islands, but it was impossible to tell at that height which was Scott's boat.The days have sort of blended a little, but I'm pretty sure I had some of the famous lobster bisque at urlLink The Boardwalk on Monday. And I went to a cocktail party, arriving just in time for a glass of lousy island wine. Tuesday: We took in the island's biggest tourist trap -- urlLink Perry's Cave . While I could think of more exciting things to do than shell out $9.50 to spend 30 minutes in a chilly, damp crack in the ground, Caroline loved it. Even more, she loved spending $5 a pop to "mine" for gemstones and arrowheads. Get this racket: You buy a bag of sand, take it out to the front lawn where they have a sluice set up, dump the sand into a sieve and shake it around in the water until the gems and arrowheads (all which have been planted in the bag of sand) are revealed. Of course, she is thrilled with her little chunks of citrine, garnet, peridot and quartz... so I guess it wasn't a total waste, eh? Phil brought the powerboat over Tuesday evening and I have to admit I was really glad to see him. See, the first time I ever saw him was on the island, so it's kind of "our" place. And except for one day last fall when I went over to take some lomoshots one morning, I haven't been to Put-in-Bay withouthim for nearly 16 years. We had sushi and beers for dinner, then stopped in at Tony's forice cream and beer. Scott was with us for a bit, but then went back to hang out with his teammates. We took Caroline to the water taxi, which delivered her to the boat for the night. After I knew she was settled in with "Molly Moon's Incredible Book of Hypnotism," Phil and I went to get our drunk on. So in the entry below, where I showed the photos of the places I was going to drink... that pretty much sums it up. Wednesday: We spent the morning on the water, watching the races. Monday and Tuesday had been qualifier days for the Championship and the Commodore fleets. Scott's boat didn't make the cut into the Championship fleet, so they were sailing in the Commodore fleet races on Wednesday and Thursday. I'd like to say they did well... but they didn't. They had lots of things they did right. It just wasn't enough to propel them into contention for hardware. At lunchtime, Phil dropped Caroline and I off on the island -- she'd had enough of the waves -- and we rode our bikes around the island more and did some browsing in the shops. At Del Sol, we bought this awesome nail polish that changes color in the sun, going from a coral-y pink to purple. We were barely out of the shop before we painted our toenails. In the evening, all the team members and their parents gathered for a party in the backyard of urlLink Aunt Jane's Victorian Manor , which is owned by the aunt of two of the kids on the sailing team. Phil and I were assigned to "fire watch" at the hotel where all the teams were staying, so we went to the hotel first. There were three teams of two assigned to each fire watch shift. Our primary job was to make sure the kids weren't causing any trouble and to keep the boys out of the girls rooms and vice versa. We wererelieved for a short time by a couple of guys from our club so we could go to the party for awhile, butwent back to the hotel after about 30 minutes. When our shift ended, two of the three sets of replacements arrived, so we volunteered to wait in the girls' hall until the final set arrived. About waiting ten minutes beyond the official start of the next shift, we were beginning to wonder where our replacements were. Finally, Phil went out into the lobby to find two women sitting in the armchairs, reading books. I went out and asked them if they were on duty. "Yes," the one woman replied. I recognized the second one as having walked right past us in the hall and did not tell us she was there to replace us . I asked if they wanted our chair in the hallway in order to keep an eye on things. The first woman said, "No. That's not something I choose to do." Gahhhhhhhh! Now, I'm no prude. Not by a long shot. So if she wanted to ignore therules and let the kids do whatever the hell they want... so be it.But I was so pissed that the stupid bitch couldn't choose to let us know she was there before we fucking starved to death! By that time, the party was over and most of the restaurants had closed. We managed to get something at Mossback's before heading out to the boat to crash. Thursday: Phil headed back home in the morning, while Caroline and I slept-in late. By the time we were up and showered, Scott had finished racing for the week. He hung out with us until My mom arrived on the ferry. We had pizza at Frosty's, then Scott went off to get ready for the closing awards banquet. Can I justtell you how handsome myboy -- who hates to dress up -- looked at the banquet wearing khaki pants, white shirt, navy blazer and tie? I know I'm biased, but he really did look so damn cute. Near the end of the banquet, the thunderstorm that had been brewing out over the lake finally hit. So Caroline, Mom and I went back to the boat. Scott came for a short visit... I think preparing himself for the initiation that lay ahead. Friday: At 8 a.m. I called for the water taxi to get Caroline and I to the registration table for the I-LYA Optimist Championship, a 1-day regatta for urlLink Optimist sailors. I didn't really think anything of it when the driver told me he was already heading my way. When the taxi arrived, Scott was aboard with all his gear. Checkout at the hotel wasn't until 9 a.m., but he had gathered his things as soon as he woke up and left. As the day progressed, we found out it was because he had to drink water from one of his teammate's sailing boots. There aren't any circumstances under which drinking from a funky old sailing boot is pleasant, but for some reason the entire thing pissed Scott off. After tossing his cookies, he launched a four-letter tirade at his roommates, then stormed out of the hotel after curfew. He walked to Perry's monument where he "threw his guts up" and in the process, lost his flip-flops... which he was wearing because the day before,he'd managed todrop one of his Chuck Taylor high tops overboard while on our boat. Barefoot, he went back to the hotel, where he passed the night and broke camp as early as possible. "I wanted to get away from those fuckers," he told me. I feel for the kid... sort of. I mean, he knew all week that something like this would happen. But perhaps he thought that because his teammates think he's cool that he would somehow escape initiation. Or maybe he felt as if drinking "bootwater" is somehow worse than having an eyebrow shaved off. But I think he got over it, because later I heard Scott tell Phil the initiation that "they will talk about for years to come." Erm, ohhhkay. In the meantime, Caroline entered the Opti regatta. Mom, FIL (who had arrived on an early ferry to take our boat back home) and I watched from shore. We couldn't really tell which boat was her, but we were pretty certain it was one of the boats near the back of the fleet. After three races, we saw one boat head back to the yacht club and realized it was Caroline. When we met her down there, she was wet and shivering. She told me she had dumped before the race even started. While her coaches were bailing her boat, one of the lines had gotten tangled in her mainsheet block, so she had little control over her main. I think sticking it out three races was a pretty good start to her racing career. And even after the results were tallied, she didn't finish last. So, go Caroline! FIL and Scott sailed our boat back to Sandusky, while Mom, Caro andI waited around for the awards. Caroline thought they might give out participation awards... she said "precipitation," then laughed and corrected herself. I told her that since she had gotten so wet, she deserved a precipitation award, so I bought her a candy she liked... in lieu of the participation awards that weren't. From there, we caught the ferry home. The end. I"m sure there's stuff I forgot. And way more stuff than you probably wanted to know... but... there ya go.
I didn't get a chance to post yesterday after my first day back on the air. It was seamless. Mind you, I didn't say flawless... but it felt as if I had never left. I'm not sure our listeners grasped the Newhart concept we were going for with my "reintroduction," but I did get a few callers saying it's good to have me back. It's good to be back.
Ingredients: 1- urlLink island , sprinkled liberally with tourists, locals and a lot of family history. 1-30-foot sailboat called Fizgig. 1-nine-year-old girl with a freckled nose. 1-teenage boy. a pinch of rest a dash of relaxation a splash of alcohol. Frosty pizza, to taste. Directions:Add your favorite partner-in-crime on Tuesday and Wednesday. If desired, add your mother on Thursday and Friday. Mix well and enjoy. (I wanted to write a longer entry about my vacation but it started feeling like a travel brochure.) The main reason we were there was because Scott was crewing on a Thistlein his first I-LYA Junior Sail Regatta. Overall, they finished second to last for the week, but Scott learned a few things about camaraderie, meeting girls and drinking water from an old sailing boot.
For the nextsix days I will be on an island in the middle of Lake Erie that looks like this: I will drink beer here: Here: And maybe even here: Since I will berunning strictly onisland time -- no computers, no televisions and no schedules to follow -- I'll catch you this time next week.
Today was perfect for the last day of work. I had the chance to interview Alice C00per and the CFO of the B0ston P0ps in peace. Don was the only person around when it was time to say good-bye. I have to admit there was an exhilaration to getting a story finished by deadline or the feeling of scooping the competition on a big story. I expect I'll forever beusing my workas a litmus test for those who will fill the beat after me. I'll especially miss LaRaye and her incessant humming. I'll miss kibbitzing with Laura. I'll even miss the school board members. Going into the building will be strange from now on... familiar, yet no longer mine. But at least I now I know what's up those big stairs.
I probably should have clarified. That tip? It came from a police record Iread while doing cop rounds. It's not about me. I have no priors, no outstanding warrants. I'mhigher above the legal drinking age than I care to admitand I'm married to my baby daddy.
Here's a tip: If you're going to call the police on your baby daddy, it's best to first make sure you don't have outstanding warrants against you.
I dunno. I can't see Martha Stewart's stint in jail as anything but a good thing. Imagine the new products and colors. Jumpsuit orange and Cellblock grey paint;a whole new line of flatware comprised totally ofspoons; and maybe brightly-colored dinnerware patterned after cafeteria trays. Too bad the handbags made out of license plates has already been done.
It was brought to my attention last night on more than one occasion that Phil and I are, as those wacky youngsters say, "old." I suppose in comparison to the majority of the kids at the concert last night we are a little long in the tooth, but after thinking about it, I realized a couple of things: The average age of the people at last night's concert was about 19-20. Which means when 311 released their first album "Music" in 1993, those kids hadn't even gone through puberty. Even when they released their blue album in 1995 that put 311 on the map, those kids were still in middle school. It also means that the guys in the band are far closer to my decrepit age of 37 than 19-20. In fact, four of the five members of 311 were freshmen when I was a senior in high school. Now I'm not saying I'm some sort of better fan because I could have attended 311's first gigs without getting my mom's permission. I just prefer to think that instead of being "old," I'm old school.
We arrived at Prom0west Pavili0n in Columbus shortly after the doors opened at 6 p.m. Because the tickets did not say exactly when the concert was actually going to start, I had been worried that the opening band would be started and all the good vantage points taken. Instead, we were among the first to enter and staked a claim in the mosh pit directly in front of stage right. The opening band was Medeski Martin and Wood, a three-man instrumental jam band. They were groovy and kind of Phishy, but despite the inventive use of whistles and animal calls by the percussionist, the 45 minute set stretched interminably. Had I been relaxing at home with a joint, I can't think of any band better than MMW, but we were ready for 311. Before the concert started, one of the security guards came over to us and asked if we were sure we wanted to stay in the pit. "You know what happens right?" he asked, looking skeptically at Caroline. "We've had some little girls get crushed." I assured him we would be fine. I told him that the only way Caroline was going to get crushed is if they get through me first. The reactions around us were mixed. Some people thought we were nuts for letting a little girl in the pit. Others thought we were cool for bringing the kids to the show. While others were just pissed because we had a great spot and they couldn't get it. I stood behind Caroline with my hands on the rail on either side of her, forming a protective little pocket for her to stand in. Phil blocked from the left, Scott blocked from the rear (when he wasn't moshing) and a nice couple to the right blocked from that side. The moshing wasn't really a problem. The crowd surfers coming down right over our heads wasn't much of an issue, either. In fact, Scott did a little surfing himself. It was those damn little bimbos who felt they were entitled to push their way up to the front of the pit. A couple of them tried to squeeze between me and the people on the right. Tried being the operative word. I felt a little bit like Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates) in Fried Green Tomatoes when she was at the supermarket, ramming the car of the girls who took her parking space. 'Member that? "Face it girls, I'm older and I have more insurance." I doubt anyone will be surprised when I say that 311 was terrific and being so close to the stage was amazing. They did a two-hour set, a mix of old and new, including a killer cover of Led Zeppelin's "D'yer Mak'er" and the famous drum solo all the guys do together. I'd have to say this concert definitely tops my list of all-time favorites. We were standing right in front of Tim, but S.A. wasn't far away and every now and then Nick made his way over to our side of the stage. I can't say for sure whether or not it was because of Caroline, but when Nick dove into the crowd near the end of the show, he did it at the other end. I reckon landing on a nine-year-old could have been unpleasant for all involved. The best part of the night, however, was at the very end. The band did their final song and said goodnight. Before he left the stage, Chad threw one of his drumsticks out into the crowd. It landed in front of the security guard nearest us and all the people around were clammoring for it. He put it in his pocket, but as the crowd started shuffling off, he gave it to Caroline. So. Awesome night, amazing show... and now the adrenalin rush is finally starting to subside.
I'm going to see 311! I'm going to see 311! I'm going to see 311! I'm going to see 311! I'm going to see 311! There's a chance I might get backstage passes, too, so keep your fingers crossed, k?
I've made several aborted attempts at this entry. I'm struggling because my feelings are still a little tender. In a good way. Just about a week ago, my mom went to her friends' house for a couple of beers. While she was there, she met a deputy sheriff nearing retirement and his wife. When my mom told Joe that her first husband had been a deputy sheriff as well, he recognized the name. He told Mom that when he first started with the department, he'd asked the sheriff the significance of a plaque hanging in the office. The plaque was one my mother had bought in honor of my dad to memorialize deputies who had died, in the line of duty or otherwise. Joe said the sheriff told him my father had died as a result of a head injury he'd received in a fight with an unruly man while on a call. The story was new to my mom, but not outside the realm of possibility because my dad didn't always talk about work. He may never have mentioned being knocked to the ground and hitting his head on the concrete. But in early May 1970, he complained of terrible headaches. The last one was so severe, he lost consciousness. He was taken to the hospital and an abscess/aneurism/tumor... something... was removed. The doctor told my mom the operation had been a success, but my dad never woke up. He died in mid-June 1970. Joe told my mom that before he retires, he wants to find out if there is a correlation between the fight and my father's death. He said if so, he wants to get my dad's name added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in D.C., as well as the local memorial on the county courthouse lawn. Joe never knew my dad. He has no compelling reason to do this, other than his own sense of fairness and respect. While I'm knocked out by Joe's exceptional kindness, I'm even more awed that my father - who died before he'd even been deputy sheriff for a year - left that kind of impression on so many people. Even those who didn't know him. I want to be that kind of person.
Cable television has done it to me again. Specifically the USA Network with a bleeped-out version of "Blow." Why have I not seen that movie in all its un-edited Johnny Depp goodness until now? I'd blame the CIA, but this crime bears the signature of Bl0ckbuster. How can I rent every film on my to-see list when they insist on charging me late fees every time I return a movie?
My mom held one of her world famous garage sales yesterday. You haven't heard of it? Clearly you are out of the loop. She lives in a great location for it, so usually once a summer she opens her 2-1/2 car garage. My aunts and cousins bring their crap over and see if we can unload it. We hang out all day together, make a big lunch and take whatever is left to Goodwill. Good fun. All totalled, we made about $650 this time. My share was $108.95. My mom raked in $135, but $125 was selling a computer; and her cousin took in $188, but $150 of that was a TV. So I emerged the clear winner in the Pure Crap Sales division. The best part is that I no longer have a crap pile in the basement. We're getting ready to paint the house, but I'm having trouble deciding what colors to use. I want something completely different than anyone else in the neighborhood, but can't decide between an Acorn Spice house with Chianti shutters or a Sun Ray house with Caribbean Green shutters. The first combination is really warm and inviting, but the second has a really cool tropical flava. Hmmmm.
Can someone tell me how I've managed to live 37 years without experiencing "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"? I blame the CIA.
If all else fails, urlLink blame the CIA . Hey, it's the excuse I'm going with from now on.
From urlLink Jennifer : Wackiness: 114/100 Rationality: 140/100 Constructiveness: 130/100 Leadership: 128/100 You are a urlLink WRCL--Wacky Rational Constructive Leader . This makes you a golden god . People gravitate to you, and you make them feel good. You are smart, charismatic, and interesting. You may be too sensitive to others reactions, especially criticism. Your self-opinion and mood depends greatly on those around you. You think fast and have a smart mouth, is a hoot to your friends and razorwire to your enemies. You hold a grudge like a brass ring. You crackle. Although you have a leader's personality, you often choose not to lead, as leaders stray too far from their audience. You probably weren't very popular in high school--the joke's on them! You may be a rock star.
We're staying in Ohio. There are too many variables, jobs being the first. And what if we don't make enough money? The cost of housing down in Florida is more than here and we're already robbing Peter to pay Paul. We're in a debt management program, so it might be smart to get that paid off first. And with the trouble we've had staying current on all our bills, who is going to want to give us a home loan? An apartment is no place for dogs and a teenage boy. What if Scott doesn't make the sailing team? Or the soccer team? Or even fit in? Sandusky is a known entity. We know the schools, the teams, the probability that our kids will do well. We are barely scraping by, but we're managing. And when our debt is paid off, we will have a significant amount of money more than we do right now. Then we can think about moving. It's not a fun choice. It's not the exciting decision. But it feels kind of responsible.
While I readily admit to being heavily biased toward 311, their new greatest hits album is a fan-fucking-tastic album.
Looking back, it seems like 2002 was the year to take things apart and examine them. I let things lay in 2003, scattered, in disarray. This year is the one in which I put things back where they belong. I don't regret being a journalist. There are elements of it I will miss -- the people I've met, the stories I've heard, the opportunity to put my words on paper and know that thousands of people are reading them. But it was a world in which I never really fit, no matter how much I enjoyed what I did. This is not a nice way of saying something else. I'm not talking about a specific person or the climate of the newsroom. It's about me having always struggled to be a journalist. To think of all the questions that needed to be asked. To remember to follow the money. To be able to ask the questions that were difficult to ask. I've written some great stuff over the past two and a half years. I'm proud of that. But I'm also very glad to be going back where I belong.
I had a dream last night that I was leaving some sort of event... a festival or concert or something... with a teenage Caroline, when Julio Iglesi@s came up behind me and started kissing on me, trying to pick me up. He was all, "I want to make love to you." and telling me he needed it because his wife and son had just died in a car crash. That one gave me the heebies and the jeebies.
I've made it. I'll tell you about it over the weekend.
The word of the day on my SBC Yahoo DSL opening screen is untenable: (adjective) impossible to defend. Apropos for today, untenable. There is no longer any sort of defense for what I have let myself become. That photo over there on the right? She's in there somewhere, but the 56 pounds I lost has nearly completely crept right back up on me. I've let it. And I've run out of excuses. Rocky marriage? Not anymore. Work-related stress? Nope. That's gone. Can't afford a YMCA membership? Got a dusty Nordic Track in the basement and miles of sidewalks. Not to mention two fat dogs. Busy? Not that busy. It's simple, really. Before, I thought wanted something very badly. More than I ever thought I wanted something in the world. And I thought being slim and beautiful was the answer to getting it. I didn't stand a snowball's chance in hell of getting it because I wasn't beautiful on the inside at the time. But now I'm back to my old self in every way, shape and form... and I really don't like it. I don't like how I look. I'm not comfortable in my skin. But how the hell do I get that motivation back? How do I want the best me more than anything in the world?
When Caroline was a wee girl... about three or so... instead of saying bottom, she would refer to her backside as her "bobbin". Of course, we thought that was the most adorable thing ever , so we promptly adopted it. As she's matured, bobbin has fallen out of favor and I'm still mourning the loss. However, a few months ago, she coined a new Carolinism. She was in the toilet for a particularly long amount of time, prompting Phil to ask what she was doing. She replied, "Taking a dunk." Dunk. How cute is that !?
This is why I've seen "13 G0ing on 30" three times (so far):
If you take Murphy's Law and mix it with Newton's Law of Gravity, you have the show for this morning. I had to do it alone because my on-air partner took today (and all next week) off for his Annual Birthday Vacation. Also proving the theory that some things never change, my first solo gig bordered on disastrous. To the average listener, it was probably just sub-par to the normal Monday through Friday fare... but having just crawled from the mangled, hulking train wreck that it was, I know better. And I get to do it again Monday! Wheeee! If you've been wondering where I've been (yeah, I know you haven't... but humor me, mmkay?)... it's soccer camp week. Every August the kids attend a week-long day camp run by Great Britain Buckeye S0ccer. In return for one free camper, we give room and board to one of the coaches for the week. This is the fourth year we've done it and once again we've been having a great week. This year our coach is a cute boy (by boy I mean over 21, but too young for me) from Manchester UK called Kevin, who attends college here in Ohi0. Monday we took him sailing; Tuesday we forced him to watch Finding Nemo; Wednesday he raced sailboats with Phil, Scott, et. al; and last night we took him to Cedar P0int. All the while keeping him well-lubricated with Budweiser. 'Cos we're cool like that. The week has gone by much too quickly and I will be sad to see Kev go. The good news, however, is that his college is less than an hour away, so we'll be able to go down during soccer season and watch him play. Yay! So. Now that I've recovered from the embarassment that was the M0rning Mix, I'm off to record my shift for tomorrow. Cya!

Things are getting pretty crazy around here. Been doing some last minute packing before heading out to Chicago very early tomorrow morning to spend time with my father. Thanks for the prayers. They are availing much. I do not know the frequency with which I will be posting while I'm gone. Might be daily. Might not. But I shall return soon. Be safe!
The more you speak truth, the more you become one with it.-Gibran.
Ah man! Have you come across my mom's comment under the african women poem? lol. I completely adore her. She reminds me to commune with that little girl within me. In a world where young people are trying so hard to be grown, wanting to grow up so fast, I am learning to welcome my inner child to this enormous space of womanhood. Actually, my inner child is one of my biggest inspirations. Some of her memories give me hope (wings to fly)...Like, I remember that little girl who was not shy to battle grown-ups in the middle of the dance floor at birthday parties. And they got served every-single-time. I want back that kind of freedom...lol...freedom is too expensive now-a-days so people don't go after it. They're not willing to pay the price...well, I am. I'm counting the cost and going for it--whatever "it" is. oh, back to the topic at hand,(lol) I remember that little girl who walked around with a bookbag full of literature(still do, ha!), always had a notebook with pen (still do too), and passionately memorized quotes/poems by her favorite authors and poets (yup, still do this too). I would walk around quoting Gwendolyn Brooks (first poet I was introduced to in 3rd grade), Ralph Emerson, Langston Hughes, Maya Angelou, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Henry Thoreau, and other favorites, to my friends (who did not understand them; I would try to explain the words, and when they still didn't get them, I'd become frustrated--as if we weren't kids. lol). I would recite them to grown-ups who always appeared to be in awe; and certainly I quoted them to myself...you would've thought I was crazy. And people probably did! lol. But even as a young girl, I just genuinely loved the art...I respect it...indeed, God gave it to me as gift. I remember how when my friends were eager to go out and do "fun stuff", I deeply desired to be stuck in a corner reading...and the weird thing was, I found excitement and joy in it. lol. I didn't want much of anything else. But I would go out and sometimes be miserable (people-pleasing)because I did not want to endure the comments about my strange love-life with words. Basically, I was weird (still am, but I celebrate it now fully) because I grew up in an environment and a culture where people did not value the "peculiar" devotion I had to learning. See, I remember...and those memories got me here....right now.... at three something in the morning...fully awake...writing....sometimes words hold me together. And as you can see, they keep me UP too.:) Thanks mother, for reminding me that that little girl is still here with me today. And oh yeah, for those of you who have kids, work with kids, or are around kids enough to influence them, please introduce them to different kinds of literature. Especially, children in the urban communities because unfortunately, their world starts and ends right where they are. A lot of these kids are not fortunate enough to travel. Well, a book can transport you to destinations unknown. Teach them to expand their world through reading. But first, you've got to check you... make sure you read. One cannot truly succeed at teaching what he/she is not living. If you try to, you won't be able to live with or answer the questions. Selah. Blogging off....B.Girl.
Just sharing a few sentences. (Imagine what this man does to me)...haha... "I need You waaayyyy more than a casual affair You seduce the wind to move me My spirit soars to the realm that I can recognize Your voice." ... There is no love more amazing than God's. And, it is real! -B.Girl
A random thought:..If love was a spew of colors, it would be black, white, red, blue, green, pink, gray... It would be black because it's bold and definitive, solid, and can go with anything. It would be white because it's pure and celestial and accepting. It would be red because love gives you courage; love is fire with an eternal flame. Blue because its vastness links my mind to a blue sea, peaceful, calm but sometimes chaotic. It would be green because in love we are constantly evolving. Pink because love is sensitive and nurturing. Yellow because love lights me up like the sun. I stay shining and beaming for no apparent reason. And gray because sometimes love is filled with compassion and sorrow. And truth is, sometimes it hurts though it might not mean to. -B.Girl
Well, since he asked...big shout out my homeboy Jason Reynolds--that literary Prince. I appreciate the love man. Thanks for sharing the poem. I hear you! Told you... If Christ was a young poet you'd be his voice yes, that messianic voice that be resurrecting the spiritually dead that healing voice that makes crippled minds walk that power.full voice that rearranges mountains by questioning their stance And direct lost stars to find their their path You bring light to our troubled world And God... well, he spits abundant life through you. ....Write on!
oh come/let me bear you...sweet catastrophe/and bring with you the aches and pain/bring with you the trials that carry my name/for though i may wrestle on borderlines of insanity/i shall become a sanctimonious tower/unwavered, characterized by tenacity/. i am armed and ready/let's war!/and watch me overcome/. copyright 2004 Erica Kamara
Sometimes life throws things unexpected at us. Whether it's an illness of you or a loved one. Financial emptiness. Emotional ruts. Job loss. Relationship stress. Injustice. Or the like, we have to position ourselves to receive the hit. Trying times are inevitable. It's how you cope, how you strike back against adversity that really counts. Never choose to give in. Meanwhile, when things are all good, you've got to be sowing for the unexpected. Putting in physical and spiritual work (the natural comes before the spiritual). For me, it means immersing myself in God's word until I am drenched, wet from Living Water. So that when those hardtimes hit, I can pour out of myself to myself. This way, I am equipped to encourage myself from allowing my spirit to sink down below. Are you doing the work? God will allow the trials to come. Be sure to prepare for your day. It might just be within the next hour! -B.Girl
My dad's been hospitalized off and on for a while now. Illnesses regarding his heart, lungs, bones, and so forth have been plaguing his body. Among many things, it's teaching me to value my relationship with him, to become conscious of my own health, to value my relationship with God and with others, to write and share my gift with people because I never know the hour. Let me share my truth in regards to my writing life...See, though it would be nice, it is not a fantasy for me to become some big and famous writer/. I am satisfied with just being quoted while my words breathe life into a dying soul/. I just want the messages God has given me to connect with people throughout the distant and vast corners of the world/. To reach the women in villages,/ and small towns,/ on broad city streets,/ in crack-infested alleys;/ the men toiling under hot sun,/ the men gone self-destruct,/ the single fathers struggling to nurture little girls because mommy's too far to fetch/ the children displaced,/ the children war-torn,/ the children society-raised/ the ones fatherless and motherless.../just to let them know that God cares; that he sees the emblem of tears engraved on their hearts; that the hope lying dormant inside of them can be awakened if they just open up to that true, true Love/. All the while, we're looking around, God is right there./ You have a choice. Choose to see Him. OK...ok....enough for now...anyway, let me request...if you're reading this, please say a prayer for my dad, Mr. Kamara. Gratitude! --B.Girl
African women…/ We dance ‘til beats breathe through our skin Shake our tumbahs Flaunting femininity’s grace. To African balophones and djembe drums We rock our bodies Creating stylistically distinct melodies With shakeras, tambourines, and the kora. In call and response form We spit sporadic truths Moving as if our rhythm has power To merge our souls with the Son. We stomp our feet Sing atop our lungs. Expressing our RIGHT to BE… Our song is our hope Our music is dialogue Our dance is our way Of declaring our freedom. Oh yes, We dance ‘til beats breathe… Through our skin. by Erica Kamara Copyright 2004
Had a great weekend. Spent a lot of time creating and writing on Friday evening. Drove to the train station and rode the metro to Eastern Market on Saturday afternoon. Spent hours in a bookstore filled with worn books. I loved it! Bought a book by one of my all-time favorite authors, Kahlil Gibran. He's from the 1800's but his work is so relevant today. Also, bought a beautiful long tie-dyed skirt for $20. It's pink and red. Flared and very eccentric. I had a great time riding the subway. It's always fun observing the people and using the time to read or write while riding. For some reason, I've been starting poems and not ending them. It annoys me. I like to finish stuff---go all the way. And when that doesn't happen, I find myself getting frustrated at the poem. Sometimes I try to force it, though I know I shouldn't. It's teaching me patience in a very weird way. I'm learning that sometimes, a poem just needs time. Time to come about. Space to sit or just be. And then it might revisit me. --B.Girl

The last time I subdued myself to tears was probably about a month ago. I'm trying to figure out, since when has it been so much work for me to cry. Crying used to be relatively easy. Now I have to surrender myself to the tears that are probably tired of sitting in my eyes, or the unresolved issues that are tired of living in my heart. The last time I cried...I guess I was disturbed at the uncomfortable changes that were taking place in my life. God was planting seeds; and you know when seeds are being planted, there has to be a certain amount of digging up taking place. It can be a painful process. God was uprooting all of my bitterness and insecurities at the same time and I was trying to figure out what was going on. Yet I was asking him to bloom me recklessly. Well, how can that happen without, first, dealing with the root? I find that sometimes we ask God for things, but we don't want to take the whole process that is required to manifest that thing for which we've asked. I am learning to either deal with the process, or limit God and myself by asking for what I ‘think’ I will be able to handle. I find the former to be more beneficial-- so I put on and put up; or sometimes, I just simply let go! When was the last time you cried? --B.Girl
So...God answered my prayer. I FINALLY have my own spot. I just talked to God about this like...um..2 days ago, (but I thought I would have to pay a fortune to my own blog) and now I am all of a sudden lead to the site through some random clicking on the web? GET OUT!! I have so much to learn from the world, yet I have so much to say, so much to give, to share. Lord knows my thoughts are many. I just needed somewhere to put them down so the world can have (limited) access to 'em. I hope something blesses you while you're here.... And just so you'll know my purpose for being on here, I am aiming to be free....free to express myself beyond imaginations through whatever means I choose. Whatever inspires me, I'm posting. Whatever pushes my buttons, I'm posting. Whatever brings joy to my heart, I'm posting. Whatever tickles my soul, I'm what? Posting. (lol) As much as I learn, I'm posting. It's about the art of LOVE, freedom, hope, music, denial, GOD, reality, honesty and loyalty, companionship, grace, peace, heartaches, surrendering, sacrifice, purpose, growth, balance, soul, poetry, imperfection....(I could go on). It's about how my appreciation of LIFE meets my love for words, and how that passion is made transferrable to paper; well... in this case, my personal blog. ENJOY....But also, please give back to me and add to others by sharing/commenting/posting your thoughts as well....GOD's BEST TO YOUUUUUU.:) --B.Girl
When it comes to living life unpretenseful and real, children inspire me. In particular, my three-year-old niece, Breanna. Though she is a darling, Breanna is what some people would probably categorize as a mean kid because her smiles don't come too often and she is as free as can be to speak her mind. She only smiles when she feels like it, not even caring to gain approval or someone else's affection. I find many children in their formative years to be this way. It's when they begin to get older and adults start telling them whatis "polite" to do, that itbecomes confusing for them to find balance sothey end up losing some of their freedom to be themselves. Sorry to say that, unknowingly, some parentsenforce their insecurities upon their children; whereas, they want their kids to behave, the reasons behind their kids behaving are not always because it's the right thing to do, but because they want them to beperceived in a certain way by onlookers.Of course, I'd like to think that no parent consciously puts their child through this, but this happens, sometimes without even realizing it. I admire howchildren keep it real by honestly communicating theirfeelings. A friend recently made a point to me that it's because they're not as insecure as adults. To think of it, we grow up and put on armored fronts to protect our insecure/softspots. As writer Sark says, we stumble from one obligation to another, lost in a series of have-tos. People buy gifts they don't want to, attend functions out of guilt or fear, spend time with people they don't even enjoy, or end up doing random things they would really rathernot do. We go through all types of headaches just tobe approved bypeople. And litte by little, anger builds up in our hearts and we become mean and crabby because somewhere down the line, we were not being true to ourselves. Sometimes we just snap or continue to walk around with a nasty countenance or demeanor. And we're supposed to be a reflection of the Light in this world? Ithink as adults, we become masked and unbearably ugly because our real selves are covered up with masks to fit other people's perceptions . We deserve tobe free and live life unpretenseful. That's when we are able to most add to the world. Truth is, a lot of times, being the real you will be at someone else's expense. Not because you want it to, but because others are not always happy to see you walk in your destiny. I am learing that with freedom comes the responsibility to deal with other people's unlawful reactions. You can choose to give in to people's attitudes toward you or you can overlook them with loveand keep shining. Keep being the SUPERSTAR that you truly are--MASK FREE. As for me, my greatest desire is to walk in the path that God has set out for me--only me. No two people's route in life are exactly the same; sowhy even bother to go through the headache of gaining people's approval to go about your route? It's proven over again that people can neverfully understand what they have not encountered.I have realized that no one has the answers to the pivotal questions about my route. All the answers are within me. Allyour answers are within you. Any complications asyou are walking, should go, first, to the One who's directingyour path. That's the only approvalwe really need behind what we do and how we go about them. " We deserve to be caretakers of our spirits and dreams, and this means truly sensing and listening for our most alive route. It may not be a common path, or popular one, yet it will be clearly ours." --Sark blogging off....b.girl
I got this from the back of my favorite tea box. Wanted to post it since it inspires me: Add Joy To Your Daily Life 1.

Ashley Woodson is a beautiful and sweet inner city young girl I met on July fourth at a retreat center in Woodstock, IL. She appeared to be very quiet in passing. But once I sat down to talk with her, I became amazed at how much she had to share with me. Three hours passed seeming like minutes. She walked around with a book bag on her back filled with writing materials, and a composition notebook filled with writing. At eleven, she already has several books filled with poetry. With anxiety and passion, she read her work aloud to me. I sat in awe of the issues she addressed and I marveled at her play on words. As I complimented her work, she told me that she thought they were just ok and that she writes a lot of bad poems. So of course, we had this whole interesting conversation about 'bad poems'. If there is even such a thing as bad poetry; and if so, what subjects a poem to that category. Ashley went on. I listened. Ashley kept on. I learned. She is by far, the most intelligent and focused eleven year old I have conversed with. Then I aked her to tell me about herself. She talked about how she wanted to become a poet and about how she started writing. As she fluctuated from one subject to another, I found out that she had a really low self-esteem, she did not like her looks, and that she no longer liked the fact that she found companionship in writing. When I asked her why, she explained how her friends tease her for carrying around a notebook all the time and writing "stupid poetry". They ask, why can't you be like a regular young girl? Though it infuriates her when they say things like that, she does not voice her feelings to them because she says they won't listen any how. So instead, she turns to her secret world of writing to release what she calls "bad poetry". For Ashley, bad poetry is depressing poetry. Poetry that depicts the harsh reality of a young girl lost, trying to fit in. Bad poetry is poetry about a young girl who writes about how she hates her calling to words because no one seems to understand her. For me, if there is even such a thing as bad poetry, it would be poetry that does not have a heart or soul in it. Ashley's poems has her heart and soul in them. Furthermore, like famous writer Rilke, I believe that all poetry that arises out of a necessity to write is good. Because the writer acted on the calling to write down what was put in his/her heart/mind. I pulled out a poem I wrote a few months ago, particularly to uplift young girls esteem. I read it to Ashley and we both had tears in our eyes. The big smile on her face was enough of a reward for having written that poem. I dedicated the poem to her, gave her the copy to keep, gave her all the wisdom my experience have taught me abut writing and self-esteem, and we exchanged information to become pen pals. Before she walked out of the door, I heard her recite lines to the poem I had read to her moments before. I guess she was the one God had in mind when he gave those words to me. And I wrote them for her without even knowing her. Blogging off...B-Girl. p/s: oh yeah...shout to my writing pal Ashley Woodson from Evanston, IL. (I know you're reading this...haha)
While most people are either walking around with eyes wide shut or have their heads turned and would rather not see, while developed countries, or politicians and people in elite positions come up with endless excuses as to why they cannot intervene, and while you and I go about our daily routine of living the good ol American way, the world is dying. Whether it's a slow death of living on an erroneous perception of reality, or maybe through inadequate diet of media programming or 'subtle' lies from crooked officials; whether it's through the mental and physical deterioration from drug use, or an apocalypse of ethnic cleansing and mass slaughters, our brothers and sisters on the other side of the globe, right down the street from us, right in our own homes, in some cases, even ourselves, are dying. Because I have a background different from most people I am in day-to-day contact with, in that I had the unfortunate experience of living through a devastating civil war in Liberia (for four-and-a-half years), and since I tend to be extra sensitive about isues regarding wars and innocent people being massacred, I was trying to refrain from posting about this issue. However, I think it's important that I do, because through exposure, who knows what may happen? Almost since the beginning, I've been following the news stories on the horrific genocide presently pervading The Dafur province of western Sudan, Africa. The atrocities have been going on for the past 16 months (since March 2003) in Dafur. It is a fact that the Sudan government is trying to eliminate the black population. ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND people (innocent mothers, fathers, grand-parents, children, etc) are already dead, and a minimum of THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND more people will die. It is fact that up to ONE MILLION people could die. According to Boston Globe, "If they [atrocities] are not stopped immediately, the world will witness a human calamity on the scale of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda." Are you famaliar the Rwandan genocide? Well, it is important to know that over 800,000 people died in Rwanda during a span of a short few months. For what? But out of ignorance, selfishness, and intolerance. It's sad to know that the organized persecution and massacre in Dafur is a historic continuum in which successive Arab governments have sought to entirely destroy black Africans in Sudan. So...what can WE do about it?? If you are in the DC area on Thursday, July 22nd at 12 Noon, there is a "Die-In" being held at the White House. "One thousand people will lie down, as if dead, in front of the President's Mansion powerfully reminding the US Government of the number of people who are dying in Dafur each day." (http://darfurgenocide.org/dcprotest.htm) Please visit the site for more details. And if you can't make it, please go to the site to educate yourself about the situation in Sudan, search the web to find out even more info about the crisis and other crisis on a global scale so that you will know what to pray for specifically. I believe that everything intertwines. We are affected by the incidents over there even though it might not be directly. War has no justification. It can never answer for its physical, mental, or emotional destruction; nor can it answer for the blood of innocent lives that are lost. I know first-hand of what it's like to be on the other side and I cannot seem to post this without crying for the memories are still with me today. Don't feel sorry. Just take time to pray for the people of Dafur, Rwanda, Haiti, Liberia, Iraq...the list goes on. Do the research, you'll see. It's time to act! Who says one person can't make a difference? Blogging off...
"Our worst fear is not that we are inadequate, our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, "Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?" Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God; your playing small doesn't serve the world. There is nothing enlightening about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God within us. It is not just in some of us, it is in everyone. And, as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others." - Nelson Mandela
In undergrad, I took a sociology class (in particular) that included discussions on interracial relationships, mainly focusing on blacks and their relationship with people of other races. I've never thought it was wrong; and I was never bothered with it, unless people become strict in saying I will ONLY date in my race or ONLY date outside of my race because I think that an opinion of such is indeed a biased one. After all, who are we to tag love, or stamp it to stay within a certain color line or boundary? At the same time, I respect people's personal preferences; but I don't respect how people throw their preferences on others and make it a law for all of humanity to follow. With that being said, I wrote something for that Black girl and that Asian guy who educated me. By just being, they made me realize that true love is not necessarily colorblind. Even better, love recognizes the color differences, willingly accepts it and radically celebrates it for what it is. Remember the time when we were sitting in a restaurant eating and having fruitful conversation And all of a sudden this guy pulls out his camera and starts to take pictures of us? As if we were infamous or as if each of us was ill-representing our race... Like you were betraying all black men And I, all asian women? And remember the time that brotha, in utter disrespect, was trying hard to hit on you even though I had you on my arms? And how it's constant for people to stare... and stare...and stare... at us like we're committing crimes? Funny how, when holding hands We exert burning chaos and fill hearts with irrational rage. And our travels together sparks secret chatters as if we're moving down social ladders. But hey, though it's not even about that, I love... the thick texture of your natural hair the deep darkness of your complexion the dynamic richness of your African culture the way you stroke my mentals and reach deep inside of you to give me yourself And I love... your natural inquisition to dive into the abyss of my Asian culture how you find beauty in the slant of my eyes and make me feel good about the thinness of my hair and how I give you me, like the pureness of a child I mean, why use racial backgrounds as foundation to build upon when we've got passion and love more abysmal than the Atlantic ocean? And since our relationship is platform, Let's be that voice that'll tell the world that love is color--Full. And while most people believe we are representations of all that's wrong with society We know we are an example of all that is right. Because this is how it is.
I miss writing on here daily. I've been procrastinating to come online because I don't like the keyboard on this computer. lol. What's the purpose of dividing the keyboard letters in half. Can someone please tell me? For real, I'm trying to figure this one out. Anyway, all is well here. Since it's been a some days...let me go back and recap...Saturday, I got to Illinois at seven thirty in the morn.(8:30 AM eastern time)...chilled with my family who were so delighted to see me....took an afteroon walk with dad (who happens to be doing so much better, by the way), came back home and slept myself away. I had to be up at 3a.m. on Saturday morning to leave and catch my 6:15 flight for Chicago. Thanks to my amazing potna who risked sleep to take me to the airport. Anyway, Sunday, went to church, and then went all around Chicago with my fully sanguine brother Eric. Monday, went out to the mall with my sister. We spent 2 hours in Sephora, her favorite store and my new found obsession. lol. Tuesday, spent 70% of the day twisting my hair...ahhhhh...then went out with my sister and her boyfriend to eat and play miniature golf, my new found hobbie. I had so much fun playing. I'm surely finding a spot, once I get back home, to go play. Wednesday, two of my sisters and me went to my other sister's house to watch movies and eat. But I ended up in the corner reading The Diary of Anne Frank instead of watching the movie. Oh well! And today, well I'm feeling like going to sit in Borders, catch up on reading my Word, and just chill man. Till next time...Peace out, Love out too...blogging off....this Bohemian girl:)
Every so often I get to accessing my life and almost always, I realize how much I take for granted the immense blessings God's given me. I mean, besides the basics of having my every need met--food, clothing, shelter, healthy mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual states--I have even my silliest wants met too. lol. I have such an imperfectly wonderful life and I am hooked up with some of the most wonderful persons in the world. It's an amazing gift to have the unconditional love and support of family and friends who adore me and vice versa. It is so easy to overlook the simple things, the everyday people in our lives. Yet, it is those very people who add meaning to us and keeps us going on. When it all comes down to it, isn't it true that what we really miss the most are the simple things? The conversations with friends, the embrace, the smiles and laughter, the hanging-outs, and so forth? I am so glad for the opportunity to create memories with the paternal side of my family. I am making the most of it and having a blast. After all, I am surrounded by a bunch of people who love to reason intelligently and have ongoing discussions about one end of the spectrum to another. Now, anyone who knows me, knows that I'm not big on food, but my dad can cook up a storm. (what does that mean anyway? ...cook up a storm?...lol)oh well, since he's been feeling a lot better, he spends a lot of time in the kitchen or in his garden. I find it very interesting watching him. And because I did not grow up around him, I have this inexplicable fascination with observing his mannerisms and so forth. I think I'll write about that sometime. However, I miss pinching my mom's cheeks, cooking and going to the mall with my sister Pink, the teachings and hugs from people at COLD, the love and conversation from my beautiful friends, and the unexpected hugs and kisses, along with answering the wide-range of blatently innocent questions that comes from my 4-year-old nephew Elven. Oh how I miss him so!! I would give anything for his hug right now. Anyway, to serve as a reminder-- Take advantage of the simple things. Author Keri Smith said, "simple things hold the secret." Appreciate the love of the people God has placed in your life-- in your household, at work, at church, wherever--realizing that they were all placed there with you for a reason. Add to them, encourage them, and love them like tomorrow will not come. Peace! -B.Girl.
Sometimes life just ain't all it's cracked up to be. And our deepest desires may not turn out to be all we imagine them to be. Still, we follow our sensual longings to find out, Only to end up drowning in a sea of regrets. Yea, we go through mental growth or the conscience awakening of having found out for ourselves But we experience moral loss, with innocence lost. And it's never really worth it.-B.Girl
" Beware: perfectionism can kill you "-Steve Brown Perfectionism induces procrastination. I am fighting to overcome this perfectionistic mindset I've acquired. Often, I would rather wait to do something perfectly or not do it at all. Somewhere down the line, I've told myself that if it can't be done right now in the right way, then I won't even start on it. ahhh...so upsetting because I find myself not getting things done because of such flawed mindset. What is "perfection" anyway, but a figment of imagination. We create this (sometimes unrealistic) ideal in our minds, and try to grab it; but since it's out of our grasp, we never attain it. Hence, we feel inadequate when we're already adequate and have eluded the fact that our ideals were unrealistic to start with any way. O yes, perfection is certainly worth striving for, but when it gets to the point where I'm at a standstill, not moving because I want something to be "perfect"--whatever that means for me, then it's time to check in. One way I look at things now is that everything, in itself, is already perfect. Every art project I start on is already perfect. It's when I begin to measure it against something else that it becomes less than adequate. You cannot compare art. Each stand on her own. Blogging off~~@ Bohemian girl
"There are three things important in life: honesty, which means living free of the cunning of the mind; compassion, because if we have no concern for others, we are monsters; and curiosity, for if the mind is not searching, it is dull and unresponsive." -Beatrice Wood
I saw this somewhere and wanted to pass it on. I think we need to go back to the days when we actually had a community. You know, those "it takes a village" days. Now, neighbors don't even care to speak and whatnot. We need more love in the world man.

There is an appointed time for everything, and a time for every affair under the heavens. A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to uproot the plant. A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to tear down, and a time to build. A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance. A time to scatter stones, and a time to gather them; a time to embrace, and a time to be far from embraces. A time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away. A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to be silent, and a time to speak. A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.

According to TIME MAGAZINE, (August 2, 2004 Issue), poetry makes the heart grow stronger. Columnist, David Bjerkie states, "It all has to do with breathing patterns and their relationship to cardiac rhythms. It turns out that reciting epic poetry--especially verses that follows a specific rhythm called hexameter makes an excellent breathing exercise." Through practice you will result in an increase in the synchronization of certain cardiorespiratory patterns that are believed to be favorable for the long term prognostic of cardic patients. Needless to say, whether or not you like poetry doesn't matter. So start reciting.
Things have been so stressful lately. So much have been going on with my school process that I don't know where to start. God has been testing my faith level all the way. There are some days when I don't feel adequate enough to deal with the level of trials He's allowed to come my way. From the beginning of my journey to grad, there have been complications. I didn't expect attending grad to be so much more of a headache than undergrad. I often wish for the days when I had less responsibility than I do now. But this is how God is growing me. I prayed a while back, "Lord I will trust you throughout this process of pursuing higher education". My prayers have come back to haunt me whenever I sit up at night worrying about how school will be paid for, how my apartment will be paid for, how other bills will be paid for, how will I find a job in such a disastrous job market, and so on. Everytime I start to worry, there is the reminder of the vow I've made to trust God. Through it all, I am here in VA Beach at Regent University, in my very first flat, broke and all (lol) but I have the rich promises of my Lord with me. And it is overwhelmingly enough. I am growing so rich in taking responsibility and in perspective, that I'm shaming my self-critic. God is living through me, inspite of. And I am more than grateful. After all, there is a price you pay for wisdom. Bless your sweet sweet heart Lord. Blogging off...this BohemianGirl
I was so bored today, that I actually started a blog. That's right people, a BLOG! Anyway, I was going to go and see 'Bend it Like Beckham' at seven on Sunday. The movie was sold out! And it's been out for...lets see, three months? We had to go to the ten oclock showing. It didn't have very much soccer in it, which was the main reason I wanted to see it. We have a soccer game this weekend. Ugh. I really don't care if we win or not. But I do want to win the game next weekend and kick some SAC Twister a...erm, butt! Went running today. Almost three miles. Was too tired to run any farther. I have Tae Kwon Do tomorrow, and I don't want to go to the Sparring Team class. I hate it. We don't even Spar for goodness sake! I guess now that I've been a black belt for a while Tae Kwon Do has kind of taken a back seat to everything else. Sheesh. I seriously think our teachers planned all their unit tests on the same day. We had a science test on the Earth's atmosphere, we had a Spanish test on unit 3.3, and we had a drill quiz in Art. Then tomorrow we have a math test on all the Algebraic Geometry we've done in the past few units, and then next week we have a General Music test on Rock-n-Roll, Rock-a-Billy, and Surf Music in the 1900s. Fun. And finals are in two weeks. The 8th grade dance is on Friday the Thirteenth. What about the kids in our class who are Triskaidekaphobic? Honestly. And they won't even let us have it in the gym, Mrs. Izzo is making us have it in the CAFETERIA! It's so dirty in there after all three lunches it isn't even funny. The janitors clean it and all, but it stinks like no tomorrow in there. Heather curled her hair today! It was all spiraled and pretty-pretty! We got to talking about this one girl in our school, and she has such long hair that we want to put bubble-gum in it and see if she chops it all off. But that would be mean, says Beth. Yada yada. Bla bla. Basketball is *evil*. Pure hell is gym class basketball. C'mon, we should at least do some cool sport, like volleyball, track, or soccer. But NO, we do basketball! Mr. Reed makes us walk around the track and dribble with our right hand. Then he says to try it with our left hand. Now, I won't go into detail, but to put it simply, I can't dribble a basketball with my left hand. THEN he told us to dribble left-handed AND jog at the same time. I can't even get walking/dribbling left-handed right, so you can imagine what RUNNING while dribbling left-handed is like for me! It left me begging him to let us play soccer the next class. Feeling: Tired. Confident. Drinking: Water. Eating: Nothing. Listening to: Evanescence. Reading: Sabriel by Garth Nix. Pretty good book. Writing: That Fantasy story for Language Arts that is limited to SIX pages. Honestly. Can she *really* put a limit on imagination? *Smiles innocently* Procrastinating: Spanish amd Math homework.
I had just enough time on the computer today (since we're packin' yo, lol) to take Tea's new DotG test (that stands for Daughters of the Goddess, a Tortallan RPG, www.therogue.net/rpg ). This time its a "What is your Gift color" This is what I got for me (my real name): If I lived in Tortall, My Gift Would look like this. urlLink What's My Gift Color? This is what I got for my character in DotG (Jaedyn of Owain's Creek): If I lived in Tortall, My Gift Would look like this. urlLink What's My Gift Color? Here's what I got for my BD name (Aylwen): If I lived in Tortall, My Gift Would look like this. urlLink What's My Gift Color? THANK YOU TEA! Today I don't have enough time to fill out that little thing I always do (Feeling, Eating, Drinking, Writing etc) so I'll do that another time. Seeya!
Update: Just got the new MB CD. Musically, I don't like it as much as the last one. The lyrics are still pretty good, but I just think overall the CD is too mellow. Or maybe I'm just judging it too quickly. Dunno, just dunno. +Shrugs+ Fave Songs on "Hotel Paper": 1) Are You Happy Now 2) Love Me Like That (Feat. Sheryl Crow) 3) Breathe 4) Tuesday Morning 5) Hotel Paper I'd say about a three and a half out of five stars. Just not as good as the first album. It's pretty good though. Love the lyrics though. Thoughtful. I'll do better though when I'm famous *grins* I know ya'll will just love my CDs and buy a ton of them and listen to them over and over again, right? "Breathe" by Michelle Branch I've been driving for an hour Just talking to the rain You say I've been driving you crazy And that it's keeping you away So just give me one good reason Tell me why I should stay 'Cause I don't wanna waste another moment In saying things we never meant to say And I take it just a little bit I hold my breath and count to ten I've been waiting for a chance To let you in. Chorus: If I just breathe Let it fill the space between I'll know everything is alright Breathe Every little piece of me You'll see Everything is alright If I just breathe Well its all so overrated In not saying how you feel So you end up watching chances fade And wondering what is real And I give you just a little time I wonder if you realize That I've been waiting 'Till I see it in your eyes Chorus So I whisper in the dark Hoping that you'll hear me Do you hear me? Chorus Everything is alright if I just breathe I've been driving for an hour Just talking to the rain.
Today Michelle Branch's new CD Hotel Paper came out. I usually don't listen to that kind of music (pop) but I like the lyrics to all of Branch's old songs, so I'll probably go out and get it tonight. But Target probably won't have it. I don't get it. They have tons of Harry Potter copies (which sold out before I could get a copy for mom and me to share) but they usually don't have the new CDs until about a month after they come out. Sheesh. I've been drawing a lot lately. My book gives me inspiration to draw evil Pirate characters. *Don't Ask*. "Are You Happy Now" by Michelle Branch No, don't just walk away Pretending everything's okay And you don't care about me, yeah. I know its just no use When all your lies become your truths And I don't care yea yeah yeah. Could you look me in the eye And tell me that you're happy now Would you tell it to my face Or have I been erased Are you happy now? Are you happy now You took all there was to take And left me with an empty plate And you don't care about it, yeah. And I, I'm giving up this game And leaving you with all the blame 'Cause I don't care, yeah yeah yeah Could you look me in the eye And tell me that you're happy now Would you tell it to my face Or have I been erased Are you happy now Are you happy now Are you happy now Are you happy now Yeah yeah yeah Do you really have everything you want You can only give something you regret You can't run away from yourself Could you look me in the eyes And tell me that you're happy now... C'mon tell it to my face Or have I been replaced Are you happy now? Yeah yeah yeah yeah oh Would you look me in the eye? Could you look me in the eye? I've had all that I can take I'm not about to break 'Cause I'm happy now, ooh. Are you happy now? Feeling: Bored. I also feel like drawing again. Drinking: What's new here? Let me wake you up when I'm drinking something besides water, K? Eating: Nada. Listening to: "Your Song" Ewan McGregor from Moulin Rouge. Reading: So yeah, I'm waiting for my vacation so I can read...STILL Writing: My novel, duh! Procrastinating: I dunno. Oh yeah! I've gotta call Evan! Oh, Evan, if you're reading this, sorry I forgot last night! I was watching Rat Race! Y'know, the movie with the narcoleptic spaniard?
Yeah, haven't posted in a while. Well, last friday was the last day of school, which I thought was really fun. At lunch our table had a feast! Melissa brought two cans of pringles, Andrea's mom made her famous chocolate-vanilla powdered cookies, someone's mom made M cookies, I brought Fruit Punch for drinks, and Heather and Jake brought a bunch of cheeto bags. The teachers picked up after us routinely during the lunch time because they were afraid we would start a food fight (which Evan and Daniel almost did, so I guess the teachers were right). Then we had our awards ceremony. They had the usual awards like the ones for all A's or all A's and B's. Then they had the ones for foreign language with like "Most fluent" or whatever. Then our team (the Rock Stars, corny I know, I didn't pick it though soo...) teachers went up and gave out more "Personal" awards. Winner of "Best Laugh" = Brett (LoL!) Winner of "Best Voice" = Of course....DANIEL. Told you he would. Winner of "Most likely to be a Lawyer" = Anisha Winner of "Most likely to be an Astronaut" as in, their head is always in the clouds = Season. Which I thought was hilarious since she is such a ditz. Winner(s) of "Most independant fashion statements" = Catie, Jill, and Courtney. Winner of "Most Diplomatic" = Matt. LoL. And there were a bunch of others. On Saturday I was really sick with strep, so I was just hanging around the house a lot. I felt equally horrible on Sunday, but I still went to clean out and paint my room. Today Shelb and I went swimming in our pool, which was blown up lopsided so Dad has to unfill, move, then refill tomorrow night. I also made hot dogs for lunch without hurting myself! WHOOT! Feeling: I feel like singing. But I don't want to scare Shelby out of the house so... Drinking: Water. Eating: M Listening to: "Are You Happy Now" by Michelle Branch Reading: I can't wait until our sixteen-hour drive to MN and MI. Then I'll be able to start reading another book. Writing: RPG posts. Procrastinating: Giving Alex her B-day present. I've had it since the Sunday before her b-day. I was going to give it to her on Wed. her B-day, but I didn't have a bag so I just said I would give it to her at her party. Then the morning before her party I get strep, and I call her and she's just like "Okay whatever." I don't think she wanted me to go anyway, and I didn't really want to either since we're not exactly friends at all and her mom probably made her invite me. So then while I'm downstairs trying to sleep, someone calls and Shelby picked up the phone. These two girls were coughing and laughing and talking in fake raspy voices and saying "Oh we're sick, we have strep!" and then they stopped and they asked Shelby if we had caller ID. Shelb said "No, but there is such a thing as *69" and they hung up. My mom did press *69 and it turned out to be Brittany's cell number. So my mom called Alex's home phone. Mom said "Hey Alex, this is Alex right?" "No, this is Brittany, but I'll get Alex for you." so then Alex comes on the phone. My mom goes "Hey, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday, and say that Mallory can't come since she has strep and I don't want you all to catch it. By the way, did you just call here?" Alex gets real quiet and just says no. So my mom says goodbye and tells me everything when I wake up for lunch. I think it's hilarious since Alex and I really don't even like each other anymore. So now I'm tempted not even to give her the present that is supposed to congratulate her supposed maturity and new age. But I know my mom will make me give it to her anyway. Oh well.
*Cries* This was the last day of a lot of things. This was my very last day of Middle School chorus after three years. This was my last day of P.E. in Middle School after three years. This was my last day of Spanish w/ Señora Rivera, and my last day of Science with Mrs. Ward. Mrs. Ward said that she, Ms. Fecher, Mrs. Weigand, and Mrs. Malchester had come up with really cool categories for awards tomorrow. Cool. Mrs. Ward and Señora Rivera both said that our 8th grade class of 2003 was, out of all their years teaching, the classes filled with the most personalities. I have to believe them. Daniel WILL win "Best Voice" because Mrs. Ward likes his voice... *Cue Music* We've come such a long long way Now the waiting is over We've shared our dreams And now it seems That time...has slipped away We leave you with a smile You're the ones who made it all worth while As we're walking down the aisle We leave you... With a smile And now we near the end Near the end And say goodbye to all our friends There'll always be Sweet memories When we look back across the years We leave you with a smile You're the ones who made it all worth while As we're walking down the aisle We leave you... With a smile We leave you...with a smiiiiiiiiiiiiiiile Feeling: My leg hurts. And I'll miss Middle School. Drinking: The usual (Erm, water...duh) Eating: M Listening to: This guy on the history channel...he is talking about Theodore Roosevelt. Reading: My dad won't let me start reading another book. He wants me to save them for the trip to Grandma's since it will be a REALLY long drive from Maryland to Minnesota. Writing: Birthday cards. Procrastinating: Everything.
Update: Life stinks. Real bad. I seriously pulled my hamstring at Tae Kwon Do, and now my whole right leg feels like Jelly. This stinks. Grand Master Bai wanted to give me something to make it feel less sore before my dad came, so he handed me this little patch thingy. He said something to the affect of "Put where hurt." He's Korean, and although his son Master Bai has slightly better English it is kind of hard to understand either of them. So I just kind of nodded. Then I saw that all over the back of the patch were Korean letters and stuff. The patch is really tingly. Weird. I'm such a klutz. Just when I thought things couldn't get bad or worse...GO FIGURE! Cue the Alanis Morrisette music! *Plays 'Ironic'* An old man turned ninety-eight He won the lottery and died the next day It's a black fly in your Chardonnay It's a death row pardon two minutes too late Isn't it ironic... don't you think (chorus) It's like rain on your wedding day It's a free ride when you've already paid It's the good advice that you just didn't take And who would've thought it figures Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye He waited his whole damn life to take that flight And as the plane crashed down he thought "Well, isn't this nice." And isn't it ironic ... don't you think It's like rain on your wedding day It's a free ride when you've already paid It's the good advice that you just didn't take And who would've thought it figures Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you When you think everything's okay and everything's going right And life has a funny way of helping you out when You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up In your face A traffic jam when you're already late It's like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife It's meeting the man of my dreams And then meeting his beautiful wife And isn't it ironic... don't you think A little too ironic.. and yeah I really do think...

wants to huggle urlLink DotG Random Hookups Jaedyn is my character in DOTG. Those nifty avatar things were made by TEA the same person who made the ever-popular FUZZIES! THANK YOU TEA. *Ahem* Well, not much has happened. Today was the first day of early dismissals. Only two days left of school. I passed all my finals! WHOOT! I got a B on science w/ an 88%, but the scantron thing screwed up so I actually have about a ninety-two, but Mrs. Ward only changed the Exam grade of people where it would've affected their final grade. I had an 85 on my Spanish final, which is a LOT better than I thought I would do...but Señora Rivera curved it since so many people were one point from passing and thus I have a 89.5, to be raised by the MUY INTELLIJENTE Y SIMPATICA Señora Rivera. All the rest were A's of different degrees, and despite the fact that I about killed myself studying for Science, I'm pretty happy. Finished Abhorsen by Garth Nix. Everyone said it wasn't as good as Sabriel, but I thought all three of them were awesome. In order of most favorite to least: 1) Sabriel (1st in the series) 2) Abhorsen (3rd in the series) 3) Lirael (2nd in the series) Good books. NOW IF YOU DON'T GO OUT AND CHECK OUT/ BUY THESE BOOKS I WILL SIC MOGGET/YRAEL AFTER YOU! Oh yeah, HOTEL PAPER comes out TUESDAY, JUNE 24TH! I'm doing a lot of advertising, aren't I? Feeling: I HAVE SUCH A BAD HEADACHE RIGHT NOW!! Gah. I'm also pretty relieved testing is over. Incredibly Tired = Me. Drinking: Water. Eating: Recees Peanut Butter Cups, Yum. Listening To: Evanescence...AGAIN Reading: I just finished Abhorsen about twenty minutes ago. Writing: My great American Novel. Oh yeah. Procrastinating: Sleeping. P.S. I'm officially the Assistant Innkeeper of the White Horse Inn on the Barrow-Downs!
Hey! Yesterday BW gave me a Personal Title! What do you think about " The Melody of Misery "? Cool, huh? Still. Finals are this week and next. That sucks. We got yearbooks on Monday though, so I'm happy. About half of the 8th grade has signed mine, and a few sixth graders and I think one seventh grader. I don't like sevies so that's okay. We had a fire drill during 8th period, then we also had a locker clean-out in the same class. And we also had to send someone to go get Newsletters during...you guessed it, the same class. The locker clean out was good for me at least because I swear I haven't seen the bottom of my locker since August. There was a whole binder down there that I haven't used since October. Weird. Ugh. Season signed Heather's YB. She wrote (direct quote): Hey Heather! It was nice getting to know you! Stay nice! Keep this autograph for when I am famous! ~Season! Yeah. Uh-huh. Well, yesterday after school, I heard that Clayton threw a pencil at Season that was full of wet glue and it got stuck in her hair. Heather said she was fussing about it for the rest of the Spanish Review. I wish I had stayed after to see it! Mrs. Fetcher still hasn't given back our Sci-Fi/Fantasy short stories yet. I want to see what grade I got. It was about a pirate who attacks her hometown because the people used to make fun of her because her magic was the ability to smell Quality Cheese and tell when someone last washed his or her socks. But (obviously, its so cliche) the heroines save the day by thinking of a clever way to divert and in then end, kill the pirate. Cool, huh? Feeling: Right now, I feel like writing. And editing, can't forget editing. I also feel tired. I always feel tired. I never sleep. ( Drinking: Water (I know, I'm getting so predictable) Eating: Pringles. Listening to: I'd Rather Be in Love, By Michelle Branch. Reading: Abhorsen by Garth Nix. Writing: Music. Procrastinating: Sleeping.
((Note: This was written on June 5th, but blogger was being stupid so I'm posting it now)) Yeah! Happy Birthday to me! Shelby made me breakfast...now, you can only imagine the shock that came with that. I wore the shirt she gave me for my present to school, and my dad drove us all. Heather said she was broke and couldn't get me a gift, but that she'd bring money to the mall Saturday and let me pick something out. Sweet. In Chorus we started watching West Side Story . The outline Sharp gave us makes it sound really stupid, and I wonder if it really is. Ahh, then in Language Arts we talked about The Giver, which I've already read and think it is totally bogus. The only part I agree with is the theme that perhaps some people really are too stupid to make the right decision. In History, Melissa and Carly wished me happy b-day, and Alex gave me a gift! It was bagged in a cool Garfield bag, and it was this little makeup kit thingy, and a few pairs of nifty socks. LoL. And Melissa counted down the minutes till my real bithday (11:09 AM), and when it came she leapt out of her chair and screamed, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MALLORY!" In Math, blah. Nada. At lunch...wait...blah, nada again. Right before gym started, Brandon asked me to the 8th grade dance! I know Brandon is kind of geeky and stuff, but he really is a nice guy, and I seriously would have gone with him "as friends" or whatever if he had asked me one week sooner. But Heather and I had already planned an Anti-Dance, Non-Conformist Alternative to the Corny 8th Grade Dance night out. In gym we played partner dodgeball. Fun. Except for the fact that as soon as Heather and I made it to second base, the people who came after us got out, making three outs! Man! And we were so happy after getting to first base, we even made it to second! Ahh, in science we talked about tides. Mrs. Ward walked up to me and whispered, "Happy Birthday, Mallory!" Next to her, Matt was like, "ITS YOUR BIRTHDAY?!?!?!" and everyone hears and starts chorusing, "Happy birthday Mallory!" Then they sang happy birthday to me in Spanish...in Spanish. Fun! I went running after school, three miles around the neighborhoods. Then I went home, took a shower, and got ready for going out for dinner. My parents have made it a tradition to go out to dinner for anyone's birthday. We went to Red Lobster, despite the fact that my whole science class thinks there is a correlation between the high cancer rate in MD and our closeness/"love" to/of seafood. Then I came home, and ate some cake! I called Heather and made plans for this weekend. We're going to go see Bruce Almighty on Saturday, then go to Sakuro's Hibachi Grill. Our last soccer game is this weekend. Cool. Oh yea! And there is this Sports Center a little ways away, and apparently they're hiring for summer jobs for teenagers helping out children's Sports Camps. One of them was for Tae Kwon Do, and I'm going to look into it. Mom said they were only looking for ages 15-17 though, but she thinks that since I'm a blackbelt in Tae Kwon Do they might make an exception. I mean, seriously, it's a good alternative to babysitting. That was my other option, but since Breana is babysat by Amanda, and Emerick hates me (but he likes my sister apparently, because he only doesn't like "Big Girls!" Direct quote), working with kids doing 'my' sport sounds like...dare I say it...fun! Feeling: Older. Hopefully Wiser. Tired. Drinking: Water. Eating: Leftover Birthday Cake. Listening to: I know I usually listen to Rock/Punk, but ever since she came out in 2001, I've loved Michelle Branch's music. I had never, ever heard Everywhere before, and still, when I heard it in the mall one night, I somehow knew the words. I've loved her music ever since. So now, since my friend's dad is in the business, I've got an early copy of Hotel Paper to listen to. Reading: Lirael by Garth Nix. Still. Writing: Music. Procrastinating: Everything. Okay, maybe not everything, but a lot of things.
Oh, by the way: MY BIRTHDAY IS TOMORROW! YAY! I'LL BE 14! AND NO CLOSER TO DRIVING!!!
Errr, yeah. Hi. Uhh, we won that soccer game 2-1, and now our team has 'bragging rights' or whatever. I know if the other team had won, they'd be living it up but our team is 'too humble' and no one has even mentioned the game at school. Oh well. But I almost killed three players during the game. I swear, I'm the only one on either team who thinks people shouldn't get called for pushing, but maybe that's because I unconsiously do that every game. Apparently, as the one girl calls it, I 'side tackled' her. Another girl, I was trying to take the ball from her and we both ran into my team's sweeper, Nora. As I tripped, I kicked the other girl who was falling to, in the eye. Now she has a black eye and Nora says she had her leg tested and it is bruised in five places. Every singe final except for math is on the THIRTEENTH! Thats FRIDAY, the 13th!! Honestly, there are at least two people I know who have triskaidekaphobia! Not to mention the fact that for midterms they spaced them out! Mrs. Weigand says the History test will be killer, but I don't think so. It's on all the things that happened after the signing of the constitution. Can't be that hard. Still, Melissa thinks the only ones anyone is going to pass are Language Arts and Math. Spanish. Will. Kill. Us. All. In other news, the school dance was canceled for about three days and a weekend, and I didn't find out until Monday. Now they've put it back on. And now they're raising lunch prices for next year. Our county sucks. It's not the kids fault the food costs so much! Oh well. Maybe next year they won't have the price raise in the high school. Basketball is STILL EVIL, but we're starting floor hockey tomorrow. In art, well...I have no idea what we're doing in art. General Music class is so boring, I think everyone just sleeps during it. We just learned about DISCO AND ABBA! You are the dancing queen Young and sweet only seventeen See that girl, watch that scene Diggin the dancing queen! I swear, leave it to Mrs. Zeigler to make you fall asleep. Feeling: Exhausted. Sick. Drinking: Water Eating: I just ate pancakes. Yum. Listening to: Ahhh, mix. Reading: Lirael by Garth Nix. Another good book. So far. Writing: Gah. Posts for BD and DOTG. But I haven't been online for those two in a while. They'll kill me. Tea and Emmie and Margery will kill me. I'M SORRY AIKO, TANIS, AND CELESTIA!!! Procrastinating: Taking Jaedyn to Tanis' party. Busy Busy. Bye. School.
OMG! I was at six flags today...it was really boring (derr) except for I got into a fight with some stranger. I was there with my dad, Shelb, Meghan, Brad, and meesh. meesh and I went on this little spinny kinda ride that had cows for the seats. While we were waiting for the ride to start, one of the game koisks was playing some rap song (like I would know what the hell they were saying...::rolls eyes:: ). The girls across from our cow were waving their arms like they were eminem or something it was soo funny, and I know it sounds stupid now but it was hilarious when meesh and I saw it. meesh was like, "Holy sh!t, its the winner of the million dollar America's Funniest Home Video award!" The 'rap' girls in the cow noticed we were laughing at them and one of them (who had really nappy blond hair and was wearing a bandaid on her cheek) sneered at us and screamed "BOO!" "Yeah! We're really scared 'cause of your mask!" meesh screamed back. *snickers* meesh is so cool. Then of course, I *had* to add, "Oh wait, it isn't a mask!" of course. Stupid, yes, but classic, ne? I GOT AIM REINSTALLED! Hallelujah! I've erased all these old s/n (paula, alex, hannah, erica...) but people who I don't know (or don't want to know) keep IMing me. But at least I can still talk to soccer friends, dotg peoples, bd peoples, and sheroes. That's cool. Besides, I love my new away messages! LoL. I HAVE DEDICATED A HIPPO AWAY MESSAGE TO *YOU* EMMIE, I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY! LoL. Meghan is leaving tomorrow. YEAH! I can't wait. Mom says I should go and see her off, but I really don't want to. I hope she has fun in D.C. since all she did while she was here all she did was complain about Brad. Oh well. I hope she has fun when she goes back home and then she'll be stuck with all three of her brothers! Brad has a twin...lol. Ugh. MD is so boring during the summer. I see my friends a lot but there is never anything to do around here. Oh well...again...I saw the Constellation last week though, an old Civil War battleship. That was kind of cool. Except that the ceilings were a bit too low for my mom so she couldn't come below deck with me, Brad, Meg, and meesh. My mom got back from here weekend work trip to Cali on...what was it...SUNDAY! She brought us all T-shirts from China-town. They're in my (and my moms...like mother like daughter...) favorite colors! Ten bucks to the person who guesses it first... (*hint*Black and Red*hint*) Tryouts are the fifteenth! I'm so ready! If I don't make soccer, no big deal. Keneisha, mom, and meesh all say I should just try out for cross country anyway since I'm a runner. I lurrrve running. Those are the only sports I'm really good at....soccer, track/cross country, and Tae Kwon Do. I am *not* hand-eye coordinated, but I can do any sport that heavily involves footwork. Speaking of TKD, I had a great practice tonight...just thought I'd mention it...being a black belt rocks...we get to learn all the awesome kicks. Sundae is such a cutie pie! Everyone mixes *her* up with Midnight, but I don't blame them. We made her an indoor cat after what happened to Middie. But she is soooooo like him its not even funny. She gets along with GenGen well... Feeling: Tired I guess. Drinking: Water...what else is new? My mom has banned pop until I get my brackets off, and I just don't care for anything but water and milk besides pop. STOP MAKING FUN OF ME BECAUSE I SAY POP!!! (Random spasms, eh?) Eating: Yumm. Mexican rice. Listening to: "Away From Me" by Evanescence. Not sure which album its from though, since I burned a new CD with my favorites from all their old albums. I could look it up, but all the Evanescence CDs from before Fallen are under my bed. I don't want to go there unless its absolutely necessary. Reading: Corsairs Corsets...by several authors that I don't feel like listing right now. Writing: Chapter six, so sue me. I know, I know! I need to keep writing! I've planned everything but I just can't write it out! Procrastinating: Practicing guitar. I know meesh will be pissed when I get to the rehearsals and I mess up all the time. I need to stop procrastinating...
I know its early in the morning, but I'm turning nocturnal these days so...I took a bunch of quizzes so I thought I'd post them here out of sheer and utter boredom. Gray: You poor, depressed child. A rain cloud seems to follow you everywhere. The worst has always got to happen doesn't it? Life is miserable. urlLink Made by Sara urlLink What color do you see the world in? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla Oh, that makes me feel wonderful... You were a brave knight, fighting for the king and dualing other knights in great battles. Perhaps you were a hero in your past life. urlLink Who were you in your past life? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla Ten bucks to the person who e-mails or sends me a PM first explaining that up there... Big Grin; :-D applaud my award-winning smile This quiz was made by Sara (www.saradover.com) urlLink What facial expression are you? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla Oh dear Lord. I can think of several of my friends' reactions to this. Mom would show me a picture (or several) of me making a smile as big as the one up there. Dad and Brad and probably Jake and most likely most of the kids at school who know me would burst out in long fits of laughter.

*Sigh* I can't wait until Meghan leaves. She makes Psycho Brad seem really nice. Thats really hard to do, by the way. We're going to Six Flags tomorrow, which I really don't want to do. First, I've been there a gazillion times since we moved to Maryland, and after a while it just gets really old. No joke. Second, did you see the news around the last weekend of June? Dude! The Six Flags I've been to *so* many times was on the news because that damn Jokers Two Face ride got stuck with 28 people on it! Now, as cool as I think that is....I'd rather not take my chances with Six Flags' track record of failed rides. I took all them quizzes Tea and Rosalie (with the accented 'i', I think) made. They're kinda fun when you're super super bored. Which I have been since school ended. All my friends are on vacation, damnit! Anyway, on to the quiz results: Quiz #1, 'DotG Name Generator' By tea. Not far off from my actual character, except that her name is Jaedyn and she is not De Negacien. urlLink My DotG name is Jaedyn de Negacien Quiz #2, 'What Job Would You Have in Tortall?' by tea. This is a joke quiz, btw. We used it when Daughter Alessia gave the students a test to see what they would be when they grew up. Jaedyn wasn't happy to receive this result (but then again, who would be (don't answer that, please!)): urlLink What Tortallan Career Would I Have? Quiz #3, 'Which DotG Character Are You?' by Rosalie. Jaedyn wasn't included in this test, so I didn't get hers. Oh well. It was a nifty quiz! urlLink What DotG Character am I? By Rosalie DUDE! Hillaron! Hell yes! He's the DotG charrie I am most like in real life. I am a pyromaniac. I love to experiment with explosive things...and then say it wasn't me! BOOM! Ahem...anyways...
Hey! Not much has been going on. Still sick of Meghan but she is leaving on Thursday so its all good. I asked some of my friends (Jake, Jem, and meesh) to fill out this quiz about me. They had to agree on everything. I got this from somewhere...can't remember. I told them I'd fill it out for them later. You're supposed to put percentages of how much you are of that adjective. It doesn't all have to add up to 100% in the end, 'cause there are too many adj. for that, but each adj. has to be ranging from 0-100%. This is what they all put for me: Wild: 55% Crazy: 60% Loveable: 89% Funny: 90% Annoying: 40% (After this adj. Jake wrote "Only on some days...") Psycho: 99% (JemJem said that this isn't always such a bad thing, but I dunno...) Daring: 50% Friendly: 75% Argumentative: 95% Patient: 0% Determined: 85% Creative: 90% Optimistic: 35% Happy: 35% Intelligent: 85% Bossy: 20% (meesh wrote: "that is your cousin Meghan's job right now...") Beautiful: Okay, on this one I got two different percentages. Jake put 80%. JemJem and meesh put 75% in a best friend sort of way. Critical: 65% Outgoing: 80% Athletic: 90% Superstitious: 15% Curious: 45% Moody: 67% Loud: 83% Passionate: 52% Obsessive: 40% Eccentric: 75% Arrogant: 59% (Gee, thanks JemJem... ;-> ) Studious: 80% Honest: 67% Open-Minded: 45% Talented: 90% Enthusiastic: 85% Lively/Active: 75% Popular: 65% Chaotic: 100% Realistic: 85% Rebellious: 85% Energetic: 50% Rough/Tough: 85% (Jake reminds me at this point what Hannah says she thought when she first met me. We were at Karate, and it was back when she was a Black belt and I was just a Red. We were about to spar and Hannah thought "Oh shit. She's gonna kick my ass like she did to that other boy!") Clumsy: 50% Spontaneous: 87% Talkative: 86% Strong: 75% Reliable/Loyal: 90% Independent: 90% Bright/Bubbly: 60% Self-Conscious: 70% Idealistic: 90% Sarcastic: 85% Child-like: 60% Yes, now I see my friend's true colors...

I haven't posted since Monday? Well then... My psycho neighbor keeps coming over and ringing the doorbell, stealing the mail, and calling on the phone. Brad thinks its hilarious and keeps egging her on. Meg thinks it is extremely freaky and wants Brad to ignore her...which he won't. We (Me, Brad, Meg) have been painting my dad's shed for FIVE DAYS! Damnit. It is the job that will never end, and its the job from hell. Thank you. Meg keeps bossing me and Brad around, so we have quit and then rejoined her painting squad on numerous occasions. Mostly because Meg would remind us after we quit that there was good money involved. We still haven't finished. On Wednesday night some cousins from my moms side (Brad Meg are from my dad's side) stayed the night. They drove from Michigan to here since their flight leaves at Baltimore-Washington International Airport. It was my Uncle Joe, his daughters Katie Sarah, Joe's 2nd wife Sue, and Sue Joe's sons, RJ and Desmond (Desi). They had to go get their passports on Thursday, but then me, Brad, Meg, Katie, and Sarah stayed home alone in the afternoon. It was very funny because my psycho neighbor kept coming to ring the doorbell. We locked all the doors and her dumbass dog still went through the backyard (since the psycho neighbor stole our padlock) and pooped all over the place. But that night my dad talked to the psycho neighbor's adoptive mother. She's in trouble now... That's about it. Oh yeah. Me, Brad, Meg, my dad went to see Lara Croft 2 today. It sucked. Don't go see it, its not worth the time. Honest. Pirates of the Carribean was better...Savvy?

Anyway, now my hair is chocolate brown instead of mousey brown, and those damn streaks turned wine red. Next time I'm either going for red or black...LoL. Also on Sunday my old friend Chelsea came over with her mom and her sister Martea. She has changed a lot since she moved to Hawaii. A LOT. She's scary now. I know I have a lot of rocker or 'punk' buddies at school, but...she cuts herself...and she...she is suicidal. And her whole entire life revolves around anime characters (that are usually gay guys that look like girls). Chelsea is so different now... SOCCER CAMP IS AWESOME! Its not one of thoses sissy and wussy camps. We get dirty, we sweat, we work hard...not to mention get a head start for the soccer tryouts for High School in a month. Its so freakin awesome. It goes from Monday-Friday and lasts from 8AM to 12PM. The ages allowed to go are from 9 to incoming 9th graders, but most of the kids there are incoming 9th graders. There are about 47 kids there, and only seven of the girls and fifteen of the boys are from South (my old Middle School). Most of them are the kids and siblings of kids from North (the other Middle School that is connected to my old Middle school...got it? LoL). We have mini-teams, each with four or five kids on them, and there are six boy mini teams and five girl mini-teams. I'm on girl mini-team five, which has a record of 0-0. Go Losers! Go us! Then there are big teams, with 8-10 people on them. There are two girls' big teams, each with 10 girls on them. They're called USA and China; I'm on USA. There are three boys' big teams, each with nine or so boys on them, called Brazil, Columbia, and Ukraine. Whichever boy team wins the tournament in their boy division goes against the girl division winner. Its awesome. What else? Not much else, really. Seeya.
Evanescence rocks my world. Okay, so maybe thats a little much, but hey, Amy Lee kicks ass. She represents the kind of person I want to be...successful and awesome without being a slut like Britney Spears. Amy doesn't need to stoop down to Britney's level (stripping and dressing like she can't afford extra fabric) to be successful and Amy is the best. Her voice is so beautiful even if she is screaming out. I've been a fan of Evanescence since before their album Origin came out, and I'm so glad they made it and Amy and Ben are doing what they were born to do. Missing by Evanescence Please, please forgive me, But I won't be home again. Maybe someday you'll have woken up, And barely conscious, you'll say to no one: "Isn't something missing?" You won't cry for my absence, I know - You forgot me long ago. Am I that unimportant...? Am I so insignificant...? Isn't something missing? Isn't someone missing me? [Chorus] Even though I'd be sacrificed, You won't try for me, not now. Though I'd die to know you love me, I'm all alone. It's too late now. Isn't someone missing me? Please, please forgive me, I won't be home again. I know what you do to yourself, Shudder deep and cry out: "Isn't something missing? Isn't someone missing me?" [Chorus] And if I bleed, I'll bleed, Knowing you don't care. And if I sleep just to dream of you And wake without you there, Isn't something missing? Isn't something... [Chorus]

My carpet is wet. Why? I live in a walled-off, warm, cozy room in the basement. While I was at Tae Kwon Do last night, the huge storm that passed over Central Maryland and many other places beside flooded my city. Flooded. Since the law states that every bedroom has to have two emergency escape routes, and I'm underground, I have one door leading upstairs and one door leading to a stairwell outside in my backyard. That damn backyard door leaked water into my room. Dammit. I'm totally done wallowing in my self-pity for now, because I got to sleep in this morning. I am becoming a night bird. I continually stay up past midnight and one oclock to wait for someone on the BDs to post, and the next morning I sleep in until twelve noon. Gramma is getting better, but she finds out this Sat. when she starts chemo. I saw Pirates of the Carribean last night. It was an AWESOME movie. I loved Jack Sparrow (Depp), and how he walked, talked, and planned like he was perpetually drunk. Awesome. Orlando Bloom was alright, but I didn't care for him much. CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow ROCKS MY WORLD! J/K. :-)
*Sobs* Gramma has cancer. I told you she went into surgery right? They found cancer. She's still in the hospital, apparently. My father knew but he didn't even tell me or Shelby until last night. We were watching " Last Comic Standing " and a commercial for Pirates of the Carribean came on. Dad and I are going to go see it tonight, but my mom asked me if I would rather wait until cousins Brad and Meghan came to visit in two weeks. Then my dad said he wasn't sure if we would still be meeting them if "something happened." Then my mom asked him if "This was something you had discussed with the kids." Shelby and I were both chorusing "What? What? Tell me!" "Gramma has cancer." Now, I have no idea what he meant about "something happening" but I don't think it is good. Now both dad's parents have cancer. Aunt Theresa, Kassie, and Ben are taking care of Grandpa. I'm scared. I love Gramma...I love her house, I love her pancakes (panercookins), I love her smile, I love her laugh, I love her rice crispie treats....and I love her. *Sobs*
Whoot! I'm back from Vacation! Hell yeah! On Friday, June 27th, my parents and sister and I drove 18 hours from Central Maryland to Winona, Minnesota where my dad's family lives. We stayed in a Holiday Inn that has a really nice pool (that I didn't swim in this year for some reason...can't remember why). On Saturday we just kinda visited with everyone and played cards a lot. Don't go to visit my dad's family unless you can deal cards really quickly or play cribbage and count your cards correctly. Up there its hard core card playing! LoL. On Sunday we did the same for most of the day. Shelby beat me at BS and King's Corner all day. That night me, Shelby, my parents, Aunt Kim, and cousin Faith went to see some movies 'cause we were all kinda bored. At least I was kinda. My mom and I went to see Alex Emma while everyone else went to see Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. Alex Emma was about a writer who falls in love with his sternographer (sp? someone who types out everything in code). Mom and I were the only two in the theatre! On Monday we went to a place where there were a ton of hand-crafted and hand-made toys and a whole carosel made of these awesome carved animals. We also played mini-golf. It was awesome. On Tuesday we went horse-back riding. I had a pretty brown mare named Dixie. We went on a trail that went uphill and I was so freaked out that the horse would go over the edge and take me with her! LoL. On Wednesday we said goodbye to my Grandparents who were about to leave for my grandpa's doctor appointment. He has cancer and needs to get medicine every Wednesday. Then we left and drove 8 hrs to get to Gwinn, Michigan. On the way, my dad got a ticket in Wisconsin for speeding to get past some slow driver. It's one-way traffic up there so the police guy fined him extra. In Wisconsin we also stopped at a cheese store where I asked the lady at the counter if the cheese was quality as stated in the Quality Cheese Act of 2003. She looked at me like I was crazy, but I don't blame her. Now, Gwinn is a really small town. They don't have air conditioning usually. They have no fast-food restaurants at all, but they do have a sit-in pizza parlour and an ice cream shop. Population: 1,500. We stayed in the Red Fox Inn at a closed-down Military Base about five miles away from Gwinn. My grandmother's and Aunt Nora's house (connected) were filled up since my Uncle Joe's family (Aunt Sue, RJ, Desi, Katie, Sara) and my Aunt Lucy and my Uncle Glenn would be staying there. On Thursday me, Shelb, Dad, Mom went to the nearest city (Marquette) and looked around all the shops. The guy at a guitar/music store yelled at me when I tried to pick up and play one of the guitars, saying that the natural oils from my hands would rust the strings. Now, I have two guitars and have had them for a long time, and the strings on them sure as hell don't look rusted! Later on Thursday we went and picked up my Uncle Glenn from the Airport. On Friday (4th of July) we all went down to the park in Gwinn to celebrate Independance day. Every year they have a little fair hosted by the VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars) and the Fire dept on alternating years. This year it was the Fire dept. Shelby and I won $93 with these rip-ticket things. At night on Friday we went down to the lake and campground my Great-Uncle Norm Meden owns (Meden's Eden, LoL) and my dad set off fireworks with my 2nd cousin Andre. On Saturday...erm...what did we do on Saturday...oh yeah! Okay, we went to this mountain called Sugarloaf where you can climb to the top where there is a little overhang where you can look at Lake Superior. Shelby, Katie, RJ, and I went the "Difficult" trail (one without a trail, LoL, we literally went rock climbing) while Aunt Lucy and my mom went the easy way where there were steps to climb. Then we went down to the break wall nearby on Lake Superior and skipped rocks. On Sunday morning we all left Michigan to drive almost 20 hours to Maryland again. It shouldve only taken 16 hours but the Pennsylvania turnpike was hell. People would stop just to watch a trucker get a ticket or stop to watch a family pee in the bushes. So now I'm home again! Feeling: Happy. LoL. 'Nuff said. Drinking: RC cola! Something besides WATER! Halleluja! Eating: Blueberry muffins Listening to: "Someday I'll Fly Away" Moulin Rouge Soundtrack. Reading: RPGs Writing: Catch-up RPG posts Procrastinating: Sending a "Get Well" card to my Grandma, who is in surgery. G'Night MD! IT FEELS SO GOOD TO BE HOME!
Away From Me I hold my breath as this life starts to take its toll I hide behind a smile as this perfect plan unfolds But oh, God, I feel I've been lied to Lost all faith in the things I have achieved and I have woken now to find myself In the shadows of all I have created I'm longing to be lost in you Away from this place I have made Won't you take me away from me? Crawling through this world As this ease flows through my veins I look into myself But my own heart has been changed I can't go on like this I loathe all I've become I, I've woken now to find myself In the shadows of all I have created I'm longing to be lost in you Away from this place I have made Won't you take me away from me? Lost in a dying world I search for something more I have grown so weary of this lie I live and I, I've woken now, to find myself In the shadows of all I have created I'm longing to be lost in you Away from this place I have made Won't you take me away from me Away from me Away from me From me From me Yeah, I'm in the Moody Music mood. I'm so incredibly bored, that I've gone through my room and thrown out everything that I have no more need of. I've found things from when I first moved here seven and a half years ago and I found stuff from when I first moved into the basement three and a half years ago. I can't wait until school on Tuesday. Ninth grade is kind of boring, but its a lot better than being grounded at home. What really sucks is that I'm looking at three more weeks of punishment and yet Hannah, who did the real dirty work that got me in trouble in the first place, gets off doing nothing. Her parents probably don't even know about what happened! So I'm the one in trouble. No worries though, Hannah, I just love being on punishment. *snickers* I've become a fan of Coldplay. At first I really didn't like their music. The first song of theirs that I heard, "Clocks", pissed me off because they stole "my" beat. Not that it was copywrited or anything. But any of my best friends could tell you that before that song came out I was drumming my hands to that beat. That's a stupid reason for not liking them, though, I know. My other reason was for the same reason I dislike the Dave Mathews (sp?) Band. Their music was too mellow. But later on, when I heard "The Scientist" I realized that their music wasn't truly mellow, it was just...well, heartfelt and honest. Full of sincerity and angst without having to cuss and strum power chords. Beauty. That is how I recently (yesterday, actually) started actually liking Coldplay. SHUT UP!! DON'T LAUGH AT ME LIKE THAT!! LoL. I've also recently realized that I really don't mind different styles of music. No, I don't adore Rap (Go Shawty, Ish yo Birfday...what the hell is that?), and I don't swoon for pop (Dirrrrrrty...what the...), but I really don't diss it like I used to. I've become so used to it (especially 50, since he's all over the place) that I don't mind it. But my heart still stays with Alternative and Classic rock. Thank God for that. I also find it hilarious that Avril Lavigne, the so-called Punk Rawk Princess, was nominated for the POP award at the MTV Video Music Awards. She so adamantly calls her music "Hard Core Punk Rawk" that I found it endlessly funny that she was nominated for an award category that also featured such "hated" artists as Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears. I love you, MTV, for showing Avril what she is, but I hate you, MTV, for not showing us Avril's face when she was nominated for a POP award. Really, I don't mind Avril's music, as I've said before, I've become used to the addling little pre-teen wanna-be Avril-ites, but she shouldn't be calling her music rock. I mean, Britney Spears' music stinks, but at least she isn't calling it Rap or Hard Core Metal. Lately I find myself listening more and more to the guitar parts in music, picking out the notes and chords. I no longer look at a song as a whole, but I rate a song by its lyrics and its guitar chords. Its sincerity. How the singer and performers really feel. Did you see Chris Martin's face as he sang "The Scientist" in front of the VMA audience? Did you see his passion? What about Michelle branch when she sang "Goodbye to You" live on my birthday last year? Did you hear her youth and her enthusiasm as she sang? What about every single song Linkin Park plays? Do you hear it in their voices? That , my friends, is what music is really all about. Here I am, rambling on (no pun intended) about music. What else is there to do? Now, honestly, I totally despise everything Christina Aguilera stands for, the way she dresses and carries herself, but I can't help but give her some props for "Can't Hold Us Down." Honestly, forget the fact that she's the only white person in the video, and forget her passive (but strong) voice and Lil Kim's appearance in the song/video. Listen to the lyrics closely... So what am I not supposed to have an opinion Should I be quiet just because I'm a woman Call me a #### cos I speak what's on my mind Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled When a female fires back Suddenly the target don't know how to act So he does what any little boy will do Making up a few false rumors or two That for sure is not a man to me Slanderin' names for popularity It's sad you only get your fame through controversy But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say This is for my girls all around the world Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth Thinking all women should be seen, not heard So what do we do girls? Shout louder! Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground Lift your hands high and wave them proud Take a deep breath and say it loud Never can, never will, can't hold us down Nobody can hold us down Nobody can hold us down Nobody can hold us down Never can, never will So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying Are you offended by the message I'm bringing Call me whatever cos your words don't mean a thing Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing If you look back in history It's a common double standard of society The guy gets all the glory the more he can score While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore I don't understand why it's okay The guy can get away with it the girl gets named All my ladies come together and make a change Start a new beginning for us everybody sing This is for my girls all around the world Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth Thinking all women should be seen, not heard What do we do girls? Shout louder! Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud Take a deep breath and say it loud Never can, never will, can't hold us down Lil' Kim: Check it - Here's something I just can't understand If the guy have three girls then he's the man He can either give us some head, sex her off If the girl do the same, then she's a whore But the table's about to turn I'll bet my fame on it Cats take my ideas and put their name on it It's aiight though, you can't hold me down I got to keep on movin' To all my girls with a man who be tryin to mack Do it right back to him and let that be that You need to let him know that his game is whack And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back But you're just a little boy Think you're so cute, so coy You must talk so big To make up for small lil' things So you're just a little boy All you'll do is annoy You must talk so big To make up for small lil' things This is for my girls... This is for my girls all around the world Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth Thinking all women should be seen, not heard So what do we do girls? Shout louder! Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud Take a deep breath and say it loud Never can, never will, can't hold us down This is for my girls all around the world Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth Thinking all women should be seen, not heard So what do we do girls? Shout louder! Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud Take a deep breath and say it loud Never can, never will, can't hold us down Spread the word, can't hold us down Really, Christina. You've outdone yourself this time. " You must talk to big to make up for smaller things... " Whoa! What girl honestly has never wanted to say this to some guy that was being, as "Snoop Dogg" would say, P-I-M-P? I really love the concept Christina is trying to get across here. Not that I'm promoting sluts or anything, but really, there always has and always will be a double standard for girls as opposed to guys. Prime example for kids at school: when we do Superfit, there are always goals for guys doing the events for superfit and they're always different from girls. Hell, I know girls who could whoop ass going by the guy's standards for the Superfit awards in P.E. Oh, lets talk about Stacie Orrico. Damn, I'm talking about a lot of Pop People today, aren't I? Well, don't worry, If you're still hanging on and still reading this, I'll get to my beloved Alternative rock soon. I don't like her first single, "Stuck", but I love her second single, "More To Life". Read: I've got it all But I feel so deprived I go up, I come down And I'm emptier inside Tell me what is this thing That I feel like I'm missing And why can't I let it go There's gotta be more to life Than chasing down every temporary high To satisfy me 'Cause the more that I'm Tripping out thinking there must be More to life Well there's life, but I'm sure There's gotta be more Than wanting more I've got the time But I'm wasting it slowly Here in this moment I'm halfway out the door Onto the next thing I'm searching for Something thats missing There's gotta be more to life Than chasing down every temporary high To satisfy me 'Cause the more that I'm Tripping out thinking their must be More to life Well there's life but I'm sure There's gotta be more I'm wanting...more I'm always waiting on something Better than this Why am I feeling like there's Something I'm missing? There's gotta be more to life Than chasing down every temporary high To satisfy me 'Cause the more that I'm Tripping out thinking there must be More to life Well there's life but I'm sure There's gotta be more... Plus I love her accent. Where is she from, anyway? She sounds Spanish or Mexican, almost. I dunno... Next song on the list. "Hell Song" by Sum41. Not really Rock, I know. More like...punk-pop, eh? Although they act like dorks in the video, I like the lyrics to this song too. " I feel I've come to realize / How fast life can be compromised... " Okay. Cool. " Knowing endless / Consequences / I feel so useless in this... " Don't we all feel this way sometimes? What about that chorus...hmmmmm: Part of me won't agree 'Cause I don't know if its for sure Suddenly, suddenly, I don't feel so insecure Part of me won't agree 'Cause I don't know if its for sure Suddenly, suddenly, I don't feel so insecure Anymore.... Another song. I have no idea who sings this one, but I know that its called Kryptonite. I know this is an old song, and I used to listen to it when my friends let me borrow their "Now" CDs. I'm not sure which "Now" it is on, since their are like, twenty of those CDs, but I've loved the song for a long time. I heard it again 'cause my dad burned it onto one of his CDs and we were listening to it on the way to Jason's. My favorite verse is this: You've called me strong You've called me weak But still your secrets I will keep You took for granted All the times I never let you down... Mmmkay, know the feeling. But I won't name any names. And I won't do that cough thing where you cough and then put the name in the cough somewhere. I know you were expecting that, don't deny it. I still like Evanescence, but only the guitar parts because they're easy to learn and quite catchy sometimes. I've fallen in love with "Bowling for Soup". They have a wicked re-make of "I Ran (So Far Away)". How do I know that it was a killer, wicked awesome remake? Even Dad liked it. Coooool. I also think that their song, "Punk Rock 101" is funny. I don't know what else to write, but I'm likely to post again tomorrow about the woes of being grounded.
On Friday I had my B-day classes, which I will go into now... First I had Creative Writing. Let me first remind you that on the schedules all they put are the course title, the teachers NAME (NOT their Title, ie, Mrs. Mr. etc), and the room number. So I walk in, and since the student's seats were apparently shown by the name cards (uhh, duh), I began looking for my name card and seat. I walk past one isle and into another and see the teacher. She's middle-aged, not young, not old. I ask, "Mrs. Mitchell?" Just to make sure I'm in the right class, you see, since I could not find my name. She glares at me, looking down her nose in a most regal way. " Dr. Mitchell." She replies. If Heather were there, she'd say, "Oh no she didn't!" (I miss you Heather! Where are you? Did you go to Glen Burnie?) Anyway, she went through the usual, boring, first-day course syllabus, and our first essay question was, "Who Are You?" Being the psychotic person that I am, I wrote a stupid, one and a half page essay that was melodramatic and predictable, since I was pissed off about the original and misleading outline of creative writing which had made me originally sign up for the course in the first place. My last three sentences were: "Most of all, I am Mallory. I will always be Mallory. Who are you?" *Snorts* Melissa, a girl from my Sunday School classes, was in my Creative Wri. class. I knew I recognized her from somewhere! She talked to me after class and I was like, "Oh yeah! Melissa! Duh!" I felt so stupid. My second class was Spanish II, which was in one of the portable classrooms outside, and Melissa walked with me since she had Spanish too. I was surprised to find that two-thirds of the class was 10th and 11th graders. It kinda made me feel cool, being a 9th grader and all. Anyway. Familiar Faces: Catie, HANNAH (ack), Ashley, Melissa, Willie, Chris, Todd (LoL), and other people...yeah. Spanish was real boring, but not half as boring as Am. Govt on A-Day is. Then I walked all the way back inside to have A lunch, as opposed to the D lunch I have on A-days. Confuzzling, ne? There were considerably more Southies at this lunch. Paula. LoL. *Snort* I sat with Catie and Ashley. Familiar Faces: Catie, Ashley, Paula, Cheryl, Jill, Daniel, Todd, etc. The whole gang. Did you know they sell Gatorade (sp?) and Mozzerella sticks at High School? COOOOL! Then I walked all the way back OUTSIDE for Algebra I. Same familiar faces: Catie, Ashely, Krista, Todd. I also noticed that SEAN was in my Algebra class. LoL. Algebra was okay. Real easy though. Speaking of easy... Todd and I went to Guitar I next. All summer I feared that Guitar I would be far, far too easy for me. My fears were confirmed when I picked up a guitar from the wall. We plucked out three notes on the High E string, E, F, and G. We weren't allowed to have picks, and we didn't even strum some chords. Linnell talked about advancing about five of the more seasoned guitarists to Guitar II, but I don't think she'll keep her word. Let me put it this way: its like being Spanish and knowing Spanish, then signing up for Spanish as a class. Or, more like me or anyone else like me taking ESOL (English Speakers of Other Languages). Get it? Other than that, its all good. Power flickered on and off with a HUGE dry thunderstorm Friday afternoon. Just thought I'd ought to tell you.
Was going to post yesterday as promised, but... Right. Back track to Tuesday morning, 5:30 AM. I wake up and get dressed and get everything ready, and go out to the bus stop at 6:30 for my first day of High School. I stood around waiting for the bus with Mandy, a neighborhood friend who is in tenth grade now, and a fellow freshman from Middle School South, Catie. I sat with Catie, and it felt so incredibly strange to be sitting in the front of the bus. I was glad to be leaving the bus stop though, because there are a few creepy people that go to my bus stop. There were about five gothic folk out there, one of whom I remember from Middle School when he was asked to cut, dye, and spike (with Elmers glue) the principal's hair. The other people there were Nina and Claire, people who I also remembered from Middle School, but I stayed away from them since they were smoking and puffing some ciggarets. I leared from my father's mistakes and decided a long time ago that I would never EVER smoke in my life. Fast forward to Advisory period. This is kind of like homeroom, and mine holds all the freshan with 'S' last names. We sat in alphabetical order, and I happened to get a seat next to one freshman who had failed ninth grade and was back again. Mrs. Hrebiniak (I amazed myself by pronouncing it correctly) explained everything to us, though it was really boring because most of it was stuff we remembered from middle school. She was very sweet, but Mrs. Hrebiniak did treat us like we were kindergarteners. She was nice though. Kind of. Next I made my way downstairs and without any trouble found my English 9 teacher, Mrs. Andrione. She spoke with a Botsonian's accent and has become one of my favorite teachers already, though I have yet to meet my other four on the next B-day. She's already given us homework, and I'm COMPLETELY stumped as to what I am going to write by tomorrow. The only time I got "lost" was going from English 9 to Keyboarding (mandatory, I swear). But I found it before the bell rang and found a seat next to other "Southies". Mrs. Taylor was boring, but she didn't hand out as many papers and Mrs. Andrione so I was happy. My parents weren't because these days the school system drills you to death with permission slips, consent forms, insurance forms (in case of DEATH or DISMEMBERMENT, y'know, *sarcasm*), and queries for money for just about everything BUT the schooling itself, which comes out of taxes anyway. Next was Biology. Remember that girl from homeroom/advisory? Yeah, the one that failed? She was in my science class, along with four others who either failed ninth grade, or just biology. Luckily there were about ten others there who I recognized from South. It was a small class. Biology teacher seemed to be a kind of "Wanna-be young" kind of person, but she gave us raisins as we (quickly) went through what was inorganic and organic. Then we went to lunch. There were only about ten Southies there that I recognized, and I sat with Amber (from P.E.) and Brandon (the one who asked me to the dance last year, when I couldn't go). Lunch sucked. I had packed a snack, in case there was nothing good at the cafeteria lines, but the only reason I couldn't get cafeteria food was because the damn schools raised the prices for lunch! 1.75 for a main course, a small side, and milk! It used to be 1.10! That means its like, 40 cents for MILK! What is the world coming to? I'm paying more for lunch than my parents are gor one gallon of gas...well, barely since the gas prices are almost two dollars now too... American Government. This was so incredibly BORING. I'm not even joking. Mr. Bright was old, I knew that from the start. He talked really, really low. He didn't know how to pronounce my name (which isn't too surprising) but not only that, he couldn't pronounce the name "KATIE". We had to yell for him to be able to hear us correct him. The teacher next door seemed a lot more fun, because we could hear him making his "back-to-school" speech about how everyone is important and everyone can make a difference. Mr. Bright goes, "Yes, I remember when I had that boy as a student, right there." He points to my seat. Mr. Bright really *was* old. Then I made my way down to the girl's locker room, so I could change for cross-country practice. The soccer team was in the Girls Gym lobby, since they had a scrimmage. The field hockey girls came in after me, and kept complaining about how the lights were out in the bathroom. At cross-country, we did our warm-up run around the school twice, which is almost two miles since its the high school and two other middle schools. Then coach made us run six 800s (two laps around the track), each with six minutes rest between, each 800 under four minutes. When we finished, we were about to do our routine sprints to end the day, but we heard thunder so the cross-country team and the field hockey team packed up and either went home with their parents or went to the Girls Gym Lobby to wait for their parents to pick them up. We were walking to the Gym, me and Kendra, when the wind got REALLY REALLY bad, and started to whip sand at us. So we started running to the gym, and got their just in time before the pouring rain came. We waited there with the field hockey people and the football boys for about a half hour. Coach let us use his cell phone to call home, and he even took one girl home since her mother was stuck in traffic. Before the rain and the lightning ended though, the janitors came to the girls lobby. They got pissed off because two of the ceiling tiles fell down because of the huge winds, and they actually ORDERED US ALL TO LEAVE THE GYM. They kicked us OUT OF THE SCHOOL! The doors only open from the inside, so we had to wait outside for our parents, in the rain and lightning. Christena was like, "This has to be illegal in at least five different ways..." Then my dad picked me up. We got home, and the cable (TV and Internet) was out. The power had gone out for almost a half hour before. This morning, school was canceled because the school and some of the students didn't have power at all. Now we have cable back, which I am very glad of because I'm grounded and am stuck in the house. Tuesday had to be the most exciting day since...a long time ago....

Romeo and Juliet's: Juliet - The daughter of Capulet and Lady Capulet. A beautiful thirteen-year-old girl, Juliet begins the play as a naÃƒÂ¯ve child who has thought little about love and marriage. She grows up quickly, though upon falling in love with Romeo, the son of her family's great enemy. Though she loves Romeo as profoundly as he loves her, Juliet nevertheless demonstrates a more level and sober head than does her paramour. Until a falling out near the end of the play, the Nurse is Juliet's closest, and, it seems, only confidante and friend. She fakes her death upon being ordered into an unwanted marrige and Romeo, thinking Juliet dead, kills himself in her tomb. Upon awakening and seeing Romeo dead, Juliet stabs herself with Romeo's dagger. urlLink * Which Tragic Shakespearean Heroin are You? * brought to you by urlLink Quizilla Ehh, good enough for me, I gues...

Because I am so EXTREMELY bored, I took this Pirate Name Generator test (by tea and Des): Mallory: urlLink My pirate name is Mad Abigail Breakes This weekend I'm going to a work picnic or something with Heather! I don't know what its gonna be like but I haven't seen my Home Fry in so long so I don't care. I've been so bored this summer and I haven't seen my friends in ages so I can't wait. Heather says another friend of hers is going, but I don't mind that either. I don't know if I know the friend, but I probably don't 'cause she didn't say his name. OMG that Gap commercial with Madonna and Missy Elliot is so funny! I think its hilarious. I don't like Gap at all, but I thought that pairing for a commercial was rather...odd. Get into the groove, let me show you some moves... LOL! I don't really like Madonna or Missy Elliot, but I still thought it was funny. I didn't do anything remotely interesting today, so get lost if you want something interesting!
Oh, dear Lord! Save me from this hell-hole that is Maryland! Save me from the boredom and save me from a wasted summer! It has been so incredibly boring these past few days. Excruciatingly boring. Okay, want to hear about my day? No, I didn't think so! Oh well, I'll tell you anyway. I woke up this morning at ten-thirty, which I was proud of since for the past two weeks I've been sleeping in since noon. Then I did nothing but watch TV and hang out on the computer until I had to get ready for Tae Kwon Do. Then I left for Tae Kwon Do. TKD was a bit more entertaining that life at home had been, since Michelle was there to laugh at/with. Even though Dennis was there, it was a decent practice because Master Kim was there too. Before we start class, Dennis asks everyone if they did anything exciting over the summer. Like three people raise their hands and they all say something to the extent of "So-and-so had surgery done!" Well, Michelle I guess was feeling goofy or couldn't help but comment. She goes, "Oh yeah! Over the weekend I had my left breast removed!" It doesn't sound funny now, but under the circumstances it was so completely hilarious! We were laughing and sniggering for a few minutes and we finally realize that Master Kim heard the whole thing! Michelle was like, "Ahh, ooops?"

Whoot! I talked to Sarah today for about two minutes. I asked her if she knew what time and where on the 15th the soccer try-outs were. She didn't know, but she says she's gonna call and ask. I'll call Nora and see if she knows too, just in case she does...yeah. Anyways...Sarah had at least some good news! Since we both have last names that end in 'S' and are close together alphabetically, we'll be in the same homeroom in 9th grade! YAY! I didn't want to be stuck there with only Northies and no one I knew, so that's good. I signed up for Guitar 1, but I hope I don't get into it 'cause I'm afraid it will be too easy. But its also a good thing I signed up for it, 'cause its another class I might have with Sarah and since it will be really easy for me it'll be an easy pass class. I watched the Pianist today. It was a sad movie. Awww. But Adrien Brody is kinda cute before he grows a beard in the movie, so I was happy. The Pianist is a very sad movie about a Jew in Warsaw, Poland during WWII, who plays the piano really really well. Sweet. He was about to get sent off to a concentration camp with his family, but his friend that was in the Jewish Police saved him and let him run away. So it was kinda like the Underground Railroad and the Pianist (I'm not sure what his first name was, it was Dutch or Polish or German or something...was it Broderick?) was shipped around in different houses by Anti-Nazi Polish people (that weren't Jewish). It was a very sad movie. Lots of dead people in it.
*Sigh* Another boring day in the life of...who am I? Oh yeah. Another boring day in the life of Mallory. When I die, no one will remember me and it feels good. Doesn't it feel good to know that after a few years, a few hundred bucks to replace the shed you blew up, and a new fire hydrant, you'll never be remembered? Oh yeah. Went to church this morning. The message of today's homaly was "Your job description is not who you are." Sure, you may be a doctor, mother, lawyer or whatever, but deep down your true self is one of God's children. Thank God for St. Paul. Brad keeps comlpaining about St. Bernadette Parish. He says the homaly is too long, then he says that the songs are too long, then he says Father Nick's nose is too long...etc.etc. you get the idea, right? First Day of School Countdown: 23 and a half days. Or is that 22 and a half? Oh well. Either way, High School is upon us and there is nothing we can do about it. Doesn't that feel great too? Knowing that you can't slow down time and ask the Superintendant for three more years of summer vacation. Well, at guitar yesterday we finished writing down the sheet music for the song "Going Under" by Evanescence. Its really an easy song, and meesh John could figure out the power chords just by listening to the CD. Awesome. Its easy to figure out the rhythm once you've got the chords too. All I need to figure out now is the guitar solo and that song is done, and we can move on to some more. Cooooool. Not much else going on. Waiting for soccer try-outs. I'm not quite 100% optimistic about making it, but me and Sarah are more optimistic than some. "We're gonna try out, and we're gonna make it! Right Mallory? Mallory?" Yeah. Ice Age, Sarah, Ice Age. *grin* Feeling: Bored. . .still. Drinking: Water. Eating: Sunflower seeds. Listening to: Exploding cars. Hehehe. They can't blame me. They'll never figure out who put the cooking oil in the middle of the street...::evil:: Reading: Nothing. Writing: Chapter Seven. Procrastinating: White Horse/ Chapter Seven
You are the Dread Pirate Roberts. There will be no survivors. Your name has become more powerful as a weapon of fear than many others ploys. Keep working to maintain the justification of that fear, but remember what is important in life. urlLink Are you a Pirate? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla Awesome. At least I'm not someone stupid like Mary Read or Black Beard. I'm someone cool who no one that doesn't know about pirates knows about. Did that make sense? No, but it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm the Dread Pirate Roberts. I don't get what it is with everyone and PotC! I mean, it was a good movie and everything, but all it did was create a whole new breed of Rabid Orli Fan Girls. GASP! But I love both Jacks, monkey and pirate.
loves urlLink DotG Random Hookups Hahaha. Just felt like posting that. I love the fuzzies.
urlLink Which HP Kid Are You? Nah, what I really wanted to get was Fred/George. But I really didn't like the fifth book, it seemed like it was really unorganized. Not to mention the fact that the most used word in Order of the Phoenix was "Said". He said, she said, it said, we said, they said. SAID! My favorite part was when Fred and George bust outta Hogwarts. Anyways...
*Sighs* Damn, its August already. Tomorrow is Emmie's and Katie's birthdays, so HAPPY EARLY B-DAY!! I just love birthdays. Yeah and I was invited to this seven-year old's birthday party tomorrow, but I have rehearsal with JemJem and meesh so I can't go. But I got her a present and I'll give it to her on Monday at Karate I guess. Less than a month until school. OMHS really isn't that big, but there are a lot of people who're gonna be there so I guess it might look/seem different since I saw it when it was empty. Most of the classes are in a certain hallway, depending on their subject. So, all I have to do is figure out where the hell my class will be in the hallway. I'm not nervous, either. Its gonna be fun. New place, new people, new ways to get in trouble...yeah. Today I watched Braveheart, 'cause I was really really bored. Its a cool movie, and I love the way Mel Gibson says 'arse' with his Scottish accent. Mom says we're going back to Scotland next year and we'll visit uncle Joe in London sometime. Cool. Can't wait. I mean, I'd much rather go to Scotland than the Carribean. Nothing much else is going on, really. Feeling: Bored. Drinking: Water, of course. Eating: Brad has eaten all the good food already. Stupid bugger. Listening to: Scottish accents. Reading: Nothing really. Writing: Chapter Seven. Procrastinating: Nothing that I can think of right now. Let me get back to you on that.
Nothing really exciting happened today, but I had a good - well, better than most! - day so I thought I'd share it with ya'll. The first sign that it was a good day was that even though it was a Monday, it was a B-day and I got driven to school so it was a sign from God that something right would happen today. Creative Writing - On my short story (Like Pandora's Box with a twist, I guess is the easiest way to explain it) I got a 190/200. The only reason I lost ten points was because my plotline was handed in a week earlier instead of with the whole packet. And on my Short Story test I got an 80/85 on my essay about Edgar Allen Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart" and a 15/15 on my multiple choice, so a 95% on my SS test. That's great! Err, well nothing happened in Spanish or Algebra or Guitar, nothing bad, but nothing particularly...nothing abnormally or unusually good either. After school we had a short Cross-Country practice. We basically did warm-up and a 50 minute free-run on campus. We had pictures at four, and it was so funny because all the shorts are reaaaaaaally short and the boys' legs were all pale and white. The girls were all screaming and whooping about how sexy their legs looked and it was just so funny. After practice Coach told us his expectations for the meet tomorrow at Chesapeake. If you remember, we had a dual meet there for our first actual run. He told me that I need to shave about six minutes off my old time, and I'm sure I can shave off four minutes but I might have to try super-hard for six whole minutes...oh well, I'll do my best and have fun and that's all that matters. At Tae Kwon Do we started Hap Ki Do lessons, which is basically a form of self-defense should you ever be grabbed or threatened. It was cool. Christa was kind of cold to me, and talked to me like I should know everything they were doing even though I had never taken HKD before. Its all good though...it was fun...Master K was there! Whoot! I love master K! (ewww, not like THAT! He's married! sheesh, you people and your sick minds! *smiles*) Then I came home, and in less than a half-hour I finish a Periodic Report due tomorrow for American Govt. We had to find an article and write one page about the article and one page on our reaction. Boo ya. Mine sucks, but its better than not doing it at all. Its about this strange tradition in Swaziland where the king gets to choose one wife a year out of the hundreds of legally eligable young women. I guess he abducted one illegally and the mother is pressing charges with a bunch of human and woman's rights activists backing her up. Now I have to finish my English Journal. We read, "The Cask of Amontillado" in English on Friday, and we had to write a journal answering these questions: "Analyze the author's (Edgar Allen Poe's) narrator in the Short Story, "The Cask of Amontillado. How reliable is Montressor in telling the story?To what extent does Poe want the reader to trust Montressor's viewpoint? Why would an author deliberately create an unreliable narrator?" Dude, Montressor was just psycho....and I've come to be reminded that in all the E.A. Poe stories I've read the [first person] narrator is always psycho. But Andrione says that Poe wrote a lot of romance/tragedies, and schools just play up all the drama/horror/thriller stories by Poe. Oh well, I'm off to finish my Poe Journal. 'Night, folks!
*Sighs* So what else is new? Please, tell me something new. Practice on Friday sucked because I felt like crap. I got sick right after lunch, so maybe it was something I ate but all through practice I was sneezing and yawning and my eyes were watering and...it was just hell. I felt a bit better on Saturday when I went to see John, and I felt really good after my three-mile run with Kendra at four. That was cool. We have sports team pictures on Monday, after practice so that we're all sweaty. Coach says it makes us look more "Real" and not all prissy in our pictures. I don't really care either way. Halloween is coming. I've narrowed it down to two ideas for costumes. Now, before you go yelling at me, saying, "You're 14, in High school! Why are you dressing up for a kid holiday?" let me just explain. I always help out at the Tae Kwon Do Halloween party every year, and I need a costume for that. But that's not the only time I can wear it! I could also wear it to school on Halloween, since it'll be a Friday this year, and I'll also wear it when handing out candy to the kiddies. So, I've narrowed it down to being an authentically dressed pirate or Samara from "The Ring." I can't decide. They'd both be easy to make, so I'm stuck. PM me, IM me, write me, let me know! Help... Ugh. Writer's block. Well, not really a block. I know what I want to write, but I just won't. I've put chapter eight off for almost a whole month now. I've edited everything on chapters one through seven, and they're changed and ready for review. I just can't get chapter eight out! Help! Mom and Dad went to a football game tonight. Shelby has Sunday School tonight. I'll be all alone. For once! But then I have SS next week and I have to face Jackie and/or her mom. Miss Valerie is the sweetest person on earth! But, after what Hannah did I'm just so scared to face them. I'm so ashamed. But, we found out what happened with Hannah. Its kind of a personal thing so I don't want to blurt it all out but, it explained a lot. It almost makes me feel a bit bad for her, but then again...after all the things she's done to me and all the trouble she has caused in my life its just so hard to feel sorry for a person like Hannah. The short story is that she's moved out of the school district for OMHS and won't be going there again, and I'm not likely to see her again for a long time so that's good. Might make things a little better in my social life without her ruining everything with my OMHS friends. She ruined everything last year in eigth grade. So...talk to me people! I'm so bored. I should be working though...
Hey everyone. I know its been a while since I posted, but I lost power for two days during Isabel and there just hasn't been much going on lately. Our meet on Thursday at Chesapeake got canceled, since its a low-lying ground and they were afraid it wouldn't be dry enough. They postponed it to next Tuesday, which means we'll have two meets in one weel; one on Tues. and one on Thurs. Oh, and today was Arundel day! Old Mill welcomed Arundel's JV boys soccer, Varsity boys soccer, Varsity girls soccer, and Varsity football to our stadium, meaning that XC had NO PLACE TO PRACTICE! I am beginning to dislike soccer more and more. Almost more than field hockey. I have friends on both teams and I'm not pissed off at any of them per ce, but I just wish that we could use the track more often. Not much else going on. Well, tonight I got my letter for my 9Gup Black Belt test, which is like going down in levels of your black belt until you get your next stripe. Its Oct. 11, which is good because I have no meet that day at all. I have to cancel practice with John and JemJem though, but that happens every week and Black Belt tests only happen three or four times a year, so... Meh. Nothing else. Argh. School is so dull. English is just getting to the point where I want to sleep during it (but I haven't yet). Keyboarding is just...so incredibly easy...if I don't use home row, that is. *evil grin* My science teacher treats us like babies, and that sucks. But my Am. Govt. teacher is fun to laugh with (at?) since he's totally deaf and you haev to scream out your answers and feel really stupid. But the company is good. Creative Writing is my best class by far. I love it. I only like Spanish2 because Catie and me and Amanda sit on the comfy floor. We've got CARPET in our Spanish class. Coooooool. Algebra is just...Algebra. And Guitar is too easy. That's it. I've nothing more to say. Hey friends, IM or Email or tell me which I should be for Halloween: A pirate or Samara from the Ring. Lemme know! Love ya!

Mmmmkay. What's up? You've all heard about Isabel. She was an on-and off category 4/5 hurricane early this week, and it hit southern North Carolina Wednesday night when I got home from Karate. They already canceled school for today (Thursday), which I thought was kind of stupid since the last time they did that for a Hurricane two years ago it didn't even rain. So I had off today. Now its been raining with slight winds for about three hours now, but it really hasn't been that bad. Shelby is happy, since today is her birthday and she's never had off school on her birthday (Niether have I! Wahh). Then I learned from coach that school would be out on Friday too, and that there would be no Hereford meet this Saturday. So its all good. No school until Monday. I'm decently happy. I guess I've been suckered into going to a football game on Tuesday. Alex told me about it over AIM (well, I was at Karate but she left messages). And I am trying to tell Heather (unsuccessfully) that I should be able to go and see the POMS squad perform. It should be fun, I've got several Middle School buddies on the JV football team, who will either be playing (I think?!) or watching, so I won't be alone. I need to support my POMS buddies so... Izzzzzzzy Izzzzzzzy IZZZZZZABEL! WHOOOT. I'm off to go and run in the rain...SINGING IN THE RAIN!!! I Ran (So Far Away): Flock of Seagulls I walked along the avenue I never thought I'd meet a guy like you Need a guy like you With auburn hair and tawny eyes The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through Hypnotize me through And I ran I ran so far away I just ran I ran all night and day I couldn't get away A cloud appears above your head A beam of light comes shining down on you Shining down on you The cloud is moving nearer still Aurora Borealis comes in view Aurora comes in view And I ran I ran so far away I just ran I ran all night and day I couldn't get away Reached out a hand to touch your face You're slowly disappearing from my view Appearing from my view Reached out a hand to try again I'm floating in a beam of light with you A beam of light with you *Two words slightly changed...
Meh. School was okay this week. Decent. I can't believe its only the third week of school. It seems like so much longer! And it seems like even longer when I think that the last cross-country meet was only just last week! Speaking of Cross-Country... Today it was pouring from the remains of hurricane Isabel today. Pouring. I prayed that it would start thundering, but does it ever? I went down to the Girl's locker room, and Toni comes down and says, "We're on unless it starts lightning!" And I just...blech. I felt horrible. We did weight training on Wednesday, and my hamstrings, obliques, and my shoulder muscles (Mr. B would be so disappointed if he knew I forgot!) felt like jello today. Anyway, life sucks a lot for me, so I had to go anyways. I was on Varsity, and since Jessica got sick (oh, what a coincidence!) Toni was on Varsity too. We ran at 4:30, after the Varsity guys. After us would go the JV guys and then the JV girls. Well, we got to the course at three, and it was pouring. Just...and well, I guess that it really wasn't bad with the rain, but rain PLUS wind is killer. Not to mention the mud. So by the time we were done doing the course walk we were freezing to death and were soaked through all our clothes and shoes. Okay, fast forward to about 3/4 of a mile into the race. A hill moderately slopes after a half mile through the extremely muddy (and I mean EXTREMELY muddy) wood trail. Even though I was in the second race, the hill was like a mud hole. I was smart enough to go far to the right where there was still some stable grass, but I know tons of people slowed down there or fell/slipped there. Other than that the course really wasn't that bad. I keep improving my time by about 3-4 minutes each race. That's decent! I'm still on Varsity since I got a 25 minute run in today. I could've done better, but my sore muscles plus the weather was just killing me. Not much else going on. Dad's coming home from Minnesota tomorrow. He was there to visit Grandma and Grandpa. They both have cancer, and its getting really bad. But lately they've been getting better, Dad says. Looks like we'll be going back for Thanksgiving or Christmas without bringing some black clothes (said in the most respectable and completely serious way, of course). That's about all. I've been running late on posts, but I should catch up this weekend. I'm looking at finishing most of my games before starting ANY new ones. I'm loaded now, I've lost count, but one or two just ended and another is on its last five or so posts. Which is good. I love 'em though, and I'll miss playing them. Its all good though. Hey, check out this really short song that I love, because I have nothing else to post about! The Last Rock Show Stand in line behind me We've got tons of time to Let it all hang out And cast the demons out. Once we're in the roof falls I heard that we have got to raise it up And let the f****r burn. And this is sure to take awhile cause if we're going out, we're goin' out with style So we all jump around, and we fall to the ground Like it's the last rock show of our lives. Same song different chorus...*Hums along*....
Blargh. School really hasn't been that bad, but I've really had some troubles with getting up so early. Well, I know some people get up way earlier than I do, but really, after two months of sleeping in late getting up at 5:45 to catch the 6:30 bus and get to school when it starts at 7 is almost killing me. And it gets really bad on A-days, since those are my most boring classes. English is my first class and I'm half asleep before announcements! That's sad. Not to mention what I'm like at 2:30 pm when Cross-Country practice starts. Yesterday I got home at 6pm and snoozed until eight, at which point I did homework and went back to bed at 11. I'm just not good without sleep. Tomorrow is school pictures. I've lived for ten school years with decent/okay school pictures. I'm really not picky about how they turn out usually, but I just want a picture that I can show to relatives with pride. All my school pictures have turned out kind of hokey. We never got my Kindergarten-First grade pictures, since then I lived in Scotland and they never sent them home. In second grade I remember that I had a terrible hairday since pictures were after Recess. In third grade my picture was halfway decent, except for the fact that through elementary school I almost always seemed to lose a few teeth right before picture day so I had a nice picture and smile in third grade but a gap in my teeth. In fourth grade I was forced to wear an ugly dress courtesy my Auntie, which I thought was horribly revealing (but it wasn't really, I was just a dork then) and then there were the teeth. I vaguely remember my fifth grade picture, in which I wore black overalls over a silky purple shirt. In sixth grade I wore the same shirt as the girl alphabetically next to me in the yearbook and I had the same hair length, so we look alike. In seventh grade I had a really bad haircut. In eight grade my shirt was the same color as the backdrop, so my head was floating. I just want a good school picture! Is that so much to ask?!? Huh?? I'm tired. Ugh. Homecoming is November 1st. I don't want to go unless someone asks me. I will go to the football game though, because Heather will be in the halftime show and I want to see how my Poms buddy does. We don't have any classes together so I just want to make sure we don't grow too far apart. Umm, what else? Kendra says that for spirit week, the Freshmen wear tropical clothes on misc. day, and wear red (I think) on school color day. Sophomores and Juniors will wear blue or white, and the Seniors wear...you guessed it! Togas! Toga, toga, toga! Don't ask. Umm, what else? Halloween is the state championship for CC. We get out of school two hours early that day for some reason (not just the CC team, the whole school). I think I'm going to be a pirate for Halloween. I don't think I'll go trick-or-treating though. No one gives out enough candy! Jeeze, you have to go through like ten neighborhoods just to get a bunch of Recees Peanut Butter Cups. Sheesh. I'll probably just stay home and give out candy and steal whatever is left. Nothing else. G'night, folks. *Yawn*
Sorry its been so long. Blogger sucks. Or, well, my computer does. Or, well, my internet does. Or, well, you know. I bet you're all wondering how the cross-country meet went on Thursday. Even if you're not, too bad. Well, it was a longer course than usual, by like a half mile. And even though most of it was in the cool woods, there were a LOT of steep hills. Still, moving on. A lot of Chesapeake girls got in front of me, but I always sprint the last three hundred metres so I caught up to some of them. And guess what? Go on, guess! I GOT ON VARSITY!!! WHOO! There were ten Old Mill girls there, and I was within the top seven so I got a spot on Varsity and next meet we go to I'll be running with the varsity girls. Cool! Old Mill didn't do so bad at the meet, but we could've done better. Not much happened on Friday. I was really tired though, I can tell you that. I also forgot my damn running shoes at home, so I had to run in my Vans. If you're wondering whether or not that hurts, trust me, running eight miles for Cross-Country practice in flat-footed Vans HURTS REALLY REALLY BAD. I learned my lesson, that's for sure. Today we had a car wash for Cross-Country. It was technically free, but most people gave donations (which is what we had hoped for in the first place). We were supposed to be there from seven to twelve, but the damn field hockey people apparently had a slot starting at ten AM. I'm not blaming the field hockey girls, I'm blaming the stupid owner of the gas station we used. Still, we made $250 in two and a half hours, so I'm happy. We'll all be able to go to the end-of-season banquet, so its all good. Kendra's mom rocks! She brought what Doug so rightly called 'sustenance', or, Hershey's chocolate, apples, and Sunny Delight. AND GRAPES!! Then I went to Jason's. It was hectic and crowded, but I did eventually get to see John. Now I'm back, finishing all my homework. I seem to have a lot this weekend. But its all really really easy. Spanish II is too easy. Way way too easy. School is a lot better than I thought it would be. Cooooooool. Oh, and I forgot to mention something that completely pisses me off. Hannah tried out for soccer, and somehow she made it and Jess and Nora didn't. When she was going to the tryouts, she never once got a ride from her own parents. And when practice started a day or two before school she had troubles getting carpool rides because her parents "couldn't take her". Then, she goes to school for a whole two days and doesn't show up at all after that. On the third day of school she didn't go to classes but then got to soccer somehow. After that she just stopped coming to school and soccer altogether. So, I'm wondering what is up with Hannah and so is Nora. I got to SpanishII yesterday and Señora calls role. When she gets to Hannah's name she goes, "Oh yes, she got dropped." Now, I wasn't sure what this meant, but I guessed that Hannah had either dropped out or she had been kicked out by the school. After school, I'm getting ready for Cross-Country and Ali is in the locker next to mine. Ali is on the soccer team, but she couldn't find an empty soccer locker so she used one of the CC lockers. And I was talking to Ali, and I asked her what was up with Hannah. She goes, "Oh, you didn't hear? Hannah's moving!" Ali also went on to say that two or three other girls on the team weren't going to practice or were showing up to scrimmages saying they forgot their uniforms. This pisses me off more than anything. I know that Nora wanted a spot on the team and Jess deserved one, and they would have been dedicated to the team. So they were rejected by some Texas-Ranger soccer coach who didn't even bother looking at the Freshman in the first place, and replaced Nora Jess with a few players that were undedicated, making stupid assumptions. Sorry, that was my rant for the day. I'm off punishment now, thank god. Hannah so needed to get in trouble. She was the one who did the dirty work and did most of the work in getting in trouble. Sure, I know I was wrong to let her do it, but I wasn't the one who actually did it! Her parents probably don't even know what happened. She lies like that sometimes. I'm so pissed with her. I had half the mind to call and tell her mom or dad, but then she'd probably lie to them and tell them it was all me. The thing with this is that I have never gotten into trouble for doing such a thing with any of my other friends, which leads my parents to lean to my side and blame Hannah. That's a relief. But I was still stuck on punishment for two and a half weeks and Hannah got off free. Oh well. Life sucks sometimes. Oh, and to add to all of that crap, my CD player is broken. Dad says a new one will be a Christmas gift. Okay, counting down the days - ahem, MONTHS until I get a new CD player. Really, its not like I'm spoiled or anything, but I'm a musician, and I neeeeeeed a way to listen to music and hook it up to my Amp for my guitar. Life sucks a lot right now.
Hey again. Me again. Bored again. A-days suck. B-days rock. On A-days I have English 9, which I used to think was fun but now I think is rather boring and below my level and every student in my class' level. Then I have Keyboarding. Mrs. T picks on me, I think. Still, the only problem I really have with that class is the fact that when we are *forced* to sit ramrod straight and the damn rollie wheely chairs dig into our backs. Ouch. Then there's Biology. I sit next to some cool guys from North, but the class is just so incredibly boring. This is also below our level. Maybe its just because these first few weeks are review days after a [not very long] summer vacation. Lastly...well, there's not many positive things I can say about Mr. Bright and American Government. He is deaf, can't pronounce ANY name WHATSOEVER, and he likes to pick random people to pick on and be mean to everyday. But isn't it every student's nature to hate teachers and school? Okay, maybe not *every* student. The point: A-days stink. B-days, on the other hand, are very cool. First I have Creative Writing, which is cool because Creative Wri. is a lot more accepting of Fantasy and Sci Fi than English is. We're currently developing three themes and three plots for short stories that will all [this is mandatory] be submitted into a county contest. Then I have Spanish out in the portables, which isn't exciting but its actually really really easy. I'm just good with languages. Then I have Algebra, which is just plain fun because of the teacher and the guys who sit near me. Funny stuff. Then there's GuitarIII, which I had to be moved up to since Guitar One was like, baby stuff for me. I haven't had a GuitarIII class yet, since she just yesterday told us the new classroom to go to, but its all good. B-days rock. Tomorrow I have a cross-country meet. Our uniforms aren't the best, but I have my lucky number nine so its all good. I know I'll do fine, but I hope my mom has fun because my dad's already been to a scrimmage but mom hasn't. Other than that, school life is just like middle school. Almost. Kind of...okay, not really. Not much else to say...
And here I thought I was looking forward to Labor day. But I wasn't expecting to be grounded. I guess I'll have to wait until the next holiday. Since I can't do anything now. Next scheduled holidays for OMHS: October 6, October 16, and October 17. I feel like a lazy bum today since I can't go anywhere. But I vaccumed today so mom let me steal cookie dough, even though she says I could get Sal Minela (sp?). I also helped clean out the basement for our yard sale on the 20th. There are some cooooool things there. I hope we get a lot of money. I have a stash where I put my cash that I've been saving up. I don't know what I'm going to do with it though. Last night I watched Gladiator. It was such a sad movie! It was so heart-wrenching when the Emporer's son cries to his father because he thinks the Emperor loves Maximus as a son and hates him! And then Joaquin's character smothers the Emperor in a hug! Dear God, how sad is that? And then when Maximus' son and wife are crucified! And that nice African man who stays a friend of Maximus'. And when Gladiator kills the Emperor, and dies soon after. Lovely. Lovely. So, the movie ended at almost 2 AM. I tried to sleep, but I kept waking up. Then, in a sudden stroke of inspiration, I type up a poem at almost 3AM. I think it was a brilliant poem, which says something since I usually hate all my writing and throw it away or delete it. Then I went to bed and had a horrible dream about Cross-Country team mates calling me by Alex Yanky's nickname for me, "Malaria." Don't ask. Anyways, I'm starting a petition. All my friends, family, and acquaintences are to wear BLACK on DECEMBER 8th . If any of you remember, this is the anniversary of Midnight getting hit by that car. I MISS YOU MIDNIGHT! Maybe if we all wear black we can ressurect him somehow. I'll wear a picture of him around my neck. We remember Midnight, though day breaks. Middie. *sob* What else am I to do? My damn muse wakes me up at 3AM to make me write a brilliant poem, and then leaves me hanging when Aman expects a post for Tadgh and I need a post for Dorlas. You suck sometimes, Butler. But it was a good poem, if I do say so myself. I should have a Tadgh post up by late tonight. If not, all hope is lost.
Hey people. I've been experimenting with different templates and I think I'm going to stick with this one until Cross Country is over at least. It's so pretty, isn't it?
I beat Erica out for Regional's Varsity Team at the County Race. A whole minute and eight seconds faster. She was practically dying, so I felt incredibly bad for her, and Kendra and I had to carry her back to our dugout before she fainted. I hope coach doesn't change his mind again. Homecoming is this week. I'm dressing up, but because I like being psycho. Tropical day, Twin day, Wacky Wednesday, Spirit Day, Halloween, then the Saturday float parade, football game, and dance. NOT GOING TO THE DANCE! YOU CAN'T MAKE ME! But I will go to the game. I love football, didn't you know? I'm a cheesehead, (ten bonus points if you know what that means) so lay off my psycho headgear. And if anyone at the Regional meet this Thursday (spirit day/school color day) thinks I am crazy for painting my face red, white, and blue, I will scream, "I AM A WHALE!" at them and confirm their suspicions. It doesn't sound right to say, "I AM A PATRIOT!" as a chant or mantra, so we decided to be whales. So, Cross Country is almost over, and thus begins a whole new season called Indoor Track. The only part of Indoor Track that is indoor are the meets, otherwise we are outside freezing our butts off while other sports (intelligent people, now that I think of it this way) like basketball are inside when it is snowing. I don't know what events I'm competing in, but it will probably be some sort of middle distance event, even though Shelby has been begging me to do pole vaulting. I'll miss Cross Country! Kevin: Who was that screaming, “We love you Kevin?” Kendra: Err… Me: We said that to everyone on the boy's JV team when they ran! Kendra: No, you said that to all of them! I only said it for Kevin and that he was our hero! Alex: Once again, Kevin’s hopes are dashed… Kendra/Me: WE LOVE YOU DAVID! David: I hate you. Me: Uh, what? Kendra: He just said he hated us! Me: That’s it, no more cheering for David. Kendra: I’m not leaving Kevin. Me: We’ll see him at the finish line! Kendra: I’m not leaving Kevin. Me: I’m not suggesting you leave him, per ce… Kendra: I’M NOT LEAVING KEVIN. Me: All righty then. Me neither. KEVIN IS MY HERO! I have a feeling that I should mention the fact that I finished five books in the past month and I am very proud of this considering the facts that (A) I have been bogged down with XC, TKD, and school, and (B) they were all books suggested to me, not books chosen of my own free will. My new mission for Christmas is to learn a Pink Floyd song for my father's Christmas gift. I must complete this mission!
My braces are completely off, but now I have these retainers in that are just like invisalign only they are only temporary to keep my teeth in place until I actually get invisalign. There was still cement on my teeth though, so they had to do that today too (that was one of the reasons I didn't want braces in the first place, LoL). The retainer kind of hurst, but at least it is removable. When I had my pallet expander in, I couldn't pronounce the letter 'K' in a word. Now I have trouble with the letter 'S' since I have the little plastic retainer over both sets of teeth. Darn it! The purpleness has gone! Whoot! Other than that, nothing has really happened. But I did turn in all of my homework today, and I'm getting A's in all my classes but Algebra. Well, actually, I'm not sure what I really have in Algebra so I have to wait until I get my progress report. I know its not less than a B though, so I'm happy with that. I'm doing well in school, is my point, anyway. I finished Chapter Nine tonight, and thus finished BOOK ONE! FINALLY! On to book two when I fell motivated. Yawn.
Yeah, its been a while, huh? Well, I had my surgery on Thursday! Go me. It hurt so incredibly bad. My doctor was gone for over a year, and he said that it would be best if we tried this new laser that had a longer wavelength than the other one. My birthmark was really purple and had to lumps, and I think they called it a cavernous hemangioma, but I'm not sure I spelled that correctly. Anyway, the first hit with the laser didn't hurt that bad. Yeah, it hurt, but not that bad. The second one, however, hurt so badly that I didn't even cry on purpose, and tears just rolled out of my eyes. Ouch. He did three more hits and it was all over. IT WORKED! Well, okay, so it swelled a lot and it isn't completely gone, but hell, the purple-ness is gone! Totally gone! It swelled and swelled to the point where I had to have ice and everyone noticed it at XC practice even though we were in the morning darkness, but IT WORKED! So I'm incredibly happy. This birthmark lip thing has just been so...taxing. I know that I don't even really think about it much anymore, but there's just something wrong when the first thing people notice about you is "That thing on your lip." I have to break the stereotype every time I meet someone new. That sounds kind of self-centered and melodramatic, but I'm not even exaggerating. Still, I'm very happy that the surgery (my 27th!) was a success, and hopefully I'll feel even better about it once the swelling goes down. Argh. Tomorrow I get all my brackets and pallet expander taken out! Whoot! I get a whole night and day without braces, and then the next day I get a retainer. Hallelujah! My XC coach (Coach W.) is totally pissing me off, with his stupid policies and how he plays favorites and worships Larry (not that its Larry's fault, Larry is a nice guy). I can't wait for Track, when its just Coach L. and the track. Thank God. And Keniesha will be there too, and so will Jenn. So I'm happy. Kind of. I just hope that Coach W feels bad next XC season when Larry, Kath, and Katerina are gone and he wonders why I'm not there to take a place. He just doesn't understand that he should set a bunch of rules and NOT MAKE EXCEPTIONS. I'm there for every race, and I make varsity too, and then he still lets whoever wasn't at a race get back on varsity. I know if I missed a race I'd have to earn my spot back. BUT NO, Kate is different. He says, "There's a big difference between your top runner and your sixth and seventh runners..." Bull. Its all varsity. Stupid stupid stupid! Argh. Sunday school. G'night!
I got my 8 gup today for my Black Belt test at Tae Kwon Do. Go me. It was cool, and I think I did really well. Master Kim was there, cool huh? Not much else really happened, but I got really far on Chapter Eight and I'll hopefully finish before the weekend, and thusly be able to start on Chapter Nine this Thursday and Friday when I have no school to attend and only Cross-country practice.

The Autumn Classic Invitational on the military base just ROCKED today. Kate decided not to run since she's been 'sick' lately, though since she talked up a storm throughout the whole meet I don't think she was that ill. We could have beat Chesa. if she would have run, but we came super close and I did so well that I'm fifth on the Varsity team now. Kendra and Tonie did really well, sticking together like glue through the whole course. Alex got back on Boys Varsity, and Trevor sucked so he's back on JV where he belongs (sorry, I love all the other boys but I'm just against Trev. Nah, just kidding Trev). David did really good. So did Kevin. Ah, Larry was in first for Varsity (first out of EVERYONE) until the last hundred-metres, which he should have sprinted...but I still think he could have beat that other dude. Its all such a blur now. I wasn't nervous once the race started, and my legs were numb so I decided to push as hard as I possibly could. And it worked. Larry got an award and whatnot, like always. Our team did pretty well, all in all. Such a feeling of companionship...not to mention the only co-ed sport for fall. *wink*. Nah, just kidding. I love all the boys. I love boys in general. The JV boys were running by and Kendra and I were screaming "We love you!" to all the OM guys that ran by. They laughed. So did we... Oh, and when we got home the football game against Chesa. was going on, and we got to see the marching band! I had never seen it before, and I thought it was so incredibly cool! Their uniforms, mostly. Okay, our mascot is the Patriots, and they were walking - marching - down the way in Revolution uniforms with flutes and drums and trumpets and everything. POMS and cheerleading followed the serenading chorus, and thusly I got to see Heather, Lexi, Sarah, and Lara before their big performance. I'll see 'em all at homecoming game, but its nice to see people you don't see very often. David stole my sandals.
I've had the sniffles really bad lately. *sniff* In Creative Writing we're writing one-act plays. I'm working with this girl named Rachel, a Junior, and my friend Sarah from Middle School. Its starting to turn into this romantic comedy set in India during British occupation, and I think it'll be super awesome (froody!) once we're done. Yeah. I'm already bragging about it and we've just barely finalized the plot/setting etc. Let me know if you want to see it when its all done... Umm, in Spanish2 we went outside and drew an airplane on the safety road, and I was an auxiliar , or, a flight attendant. JOE was a copiloto , and yeah, you guessed it, he was a co-pilot! It was funny. I walked around to all the "passengers" or classmates going, "Quieres Beber? Cola? Agua?" Someone asked me for peanuts, but I told them that we'd run out. Ha! Algebra is just so incredibly boring. Ehh, what else? Oooh, I got a 98 on my current event in American Government. Mr. B said that my reaction was excellent, but he took off two points because I only had two paragraphs - one for the summary of my newspaper article and one for my reaction. But really, he never specified about that area so I wasn't sure what was going on when I handed it in. Oh well, I did great and thats all that matters to me. During our twelve seperate four-hundred meter sprints yesterday I was the first girl to finish (ahead of a lot of boys too!) for half the sprints. It might have been because Kate felt totally sick or Emily was just feeling...well, I dunno what was wrong with her but, well, I was happy so... Invitational tomorrow. Test on Saturday. I'm so overwhelmed and I just hope I can go to the Ren-Faire on Sunday, and do something I actually consider relaxing and non-taxing on my body. For the race, my hope is to beat Jessica and possibly get closer to Katherina. But I won't be running in their race so I have nothing visually to help me, so I have to go by time. Time. My goal is twenty-four to twenty-five. That's kind of slow, almost. But its a good goal to get another point. For the Tae Kwon Do test, I just want to get the next Gup without trouble. I'm pretty confident, but I know I've been kind of half-ass lately about TKD. I asked David today why he turned Alison down for the dance. He said he didn't like her that way, and that he didn't really want to go to homecoming anyway. I hope he doesn't go, otherwise Alison will get really pissed at him if she sees him there. Argh. I also might miss the pep rally the day before the game and homecoming. We might have to leave early for the county meet. I really hope that doesn't happen. It will most likely run late, and thusly I won't be able to make it to the Tae Kwon Do Halloween party, which is always the day before Halloween anyway. So, I'm totally booked and I know I can't ditch Cross Country but I have been organizing and helping at the TKD halloween party for the past three years. Argh.... Well, its been decided. Unless I'm invited to some sort of Halloween party, I'm staying home to hand out candy on 'El Dia de los Muertos' (Day of the Dead, I think). My mom thought I was too old for trick-or-treating when I was in seventh grade, but I went last year (8th grade). This year I just feel like staying home and eating candy and watching movies and writing and... Sigh. Simone: Madame, they're coming up the steps! Madame: Well Simone, that's what the steps are there for...
I'm fairly happy with myself and what I did today. Go me. Okay, let me explain: Today is Yom Kippur. This is the first year that our county (I don't know about our whole state) decided to let us have the day off for a Jewish holiday. I find that quite fair, y'know, since we always have Christian holidays off its only fair that we at least have some Jewish or other religious holidays off, right? So, I was convinced that I would relax today, but not waste this whole day full of non-school wasted time. I woke up this morning at nine-thirty. Just right. Late enough for me to feel rested after a month of waking up at five in the morning, but early enough for me to feel like I have enough time to do things. Here's a list of things I accomplished/did today: 1) Woke up (Yay! Go me!) 2) Roller-bladed for cross training for two hours this morning 3) Finished Chapter Eight! (Hallelujah! Took long enough didn't it?) 4) Re-revised Chapters One-Seven. 5) Baked...well, burned cookies. 6) Watched a movie that was so incredibly stupid it was funny to me: Quest for Camelot, my sister asked me to put it in and I thought it was so hilarious! But the blind guy was kind of cool, and so was that two-headed dragon. "Frankly, we're the reason cousins shouldn't marry..." 7) Went and ran three miles straight with Kendra, and it turned out that it was faster than our actual course time! But that may be because it was on the track and without terrain or hills. Cool, huh? All this before I go to Tae Kwon Do, too! Yesterday I went to Sunday School. Jackie dropped out, I guess. Which stinks, because this is our last year of it and she could've held out for Confirmation. Our teacher is cool, he's an eigth grade Algebra teacher at one of the inner-city schools. He kind of talked bad about me and Melissa and Gjeelea's school and then talked a bit bad about Sev. High, since Sev. is richer than ours and his and whatnot, but he's all in all a cool guy. His mother-in-law was a little creepy at first when she asked for my name, but she's a nice lady too. Well, that's my story for the day... Oh, this really interesting RPG starts the tenth, but I don't think I'll be able to join it. Ambassador's Son, or something like that. I'm so tied down with all the RPGs I'm in now, but two are nigh to an end, but still...Dunno.

Not that spikes would help much on that killer hill. Besides, it'd be fun to slide down that one hill. Tonight is the first night of Sunday School. I want to go actually, and I hope its more interesting and interactive than first through eigth grade of Sunday School was. Yay. For some strange reason, my church does confirmation in tenth grade instead of eigth, so I can't wait for that either.
Hah...I just feel like laughing right now... Today I woke up to get to the Girl's Gym lobby at 6:30 AM for XC, since we were going to an invitational at the toughest course in the state and the course that would be used for the state race. Kendra's mum provided breakfast, being the awesome and think-of-everything mom. Then the caravan left OMHS and headed on the hour and a half drive to Hereford High. When we got there it was pouring, but we all did the course walk. Now, the course really wasn't that bad...until I saw the Hill of Doom (go ahead and laugh now if you're reading, DV!) about a mile and a half into the course. The Hill of Doom features a nearly vertical downhill slope and a nearly vertical uphill slope, with a mere wooden bridge between the two. And on this particularly wet, dreary morning, it featured about five inches of mud and hardly any stable grass. Honestly, it would make a killer awesome sledding hill, but it was just plain suicide trying to WALK up and down that hill for a XC course. Boys JV race was first. You could literally hear the ground rumble. I didn't even go to the starting line, I just went to the hill to take pictures of all our JV guys. When David got to the hill, everyone was telling the runners to slide down the hill, but David tried running and ended up ROLLING down the hill. One boy from a private school gashed his hands up 'cause he fell on a rock running down that killer hill. Not one boy came back clean, and not one boy came back with bragging rights for NOT falling. They all fell. Yeah, all of them. When they came back, all the varsity girls were getting ready, and the JV guys are all going, "Just slide on your butts down that one hill," and we were all extremely excited to get out there and do something funner than mud wrestling...SLIDE DOWN THAT ONE HILL! Pain is temporary...Pride is forever... Guess what? They canceled the meet right after that first race. That pisses me off because all our JV guys had to go through that just to show the officials that the course was too dangerous wet. Not only that...I kinda wanted to go down that hill...y'know, just to know what exactly it was like, and what it would be like at states. Honestly though, I don't think the entire boys team will make it to states. Larry will, and Kate might, and I am feeling fairly confident that the girls will. But the boys...I just don't know. And that's my story of the day!
There are few words grand enough to describe the TSO concert. In fact, I must insist that everyone reading go out on a whim and buy tickets NOW. I can say no more than it is rock meets Bach and that you will LOVE IT. Go, NOW. Anyway... As if you were born into a world of tears, you always tend to look at the darker things in life. Inside you crave attention yet push away society, and you're a hopeless romantic. Drawn to things like the occult and mysteries, you spend your time daydreaming of "What If's". urlLink What Type of Soul Do You Have ? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla Hey, that picture is kind of pretty...I don't know about my result though...

Turkey day was wonderful. My mom is such a good cook! Especially the mashed potatoes and gravy! That is always my favorite part. The turkey was good too but I didn't eat much of it. About one piece and a lot of the skin. Isn't it strange that the tastiest thing is always the least healthy to eat? It was so incredibly good though! Then last night we went to see the movie Timeline, and it wasn't crowded at the mall for once! Oh, that is so strange to type and say! Umm, the movie was really cool but I think they needed to work some things out with the whole time cycle thing. I mean, if they were born and went back in time, how did they get born again to come back and do all the stuff they did and go back in time again? And if the Scottish dude stayed, how did he die and then get reborn again so he could go back in time? It's a vicious cycle, and the movie guys could have done a better job fleshing that time idea out. Other than that, I loved it! Especially Marek's accent! Makes me want to go back home to Scotland more and more, just to hear them speak. Yeah, I'll get a boyfriend there and I won't have to watch movies to hear that awesome accent! Bwhahaha. I'm gonna see John today at three thirty. I can't go later tonight because I'm going to that concert. But it's all good and I get to go to both. Tomorrow I'm planning on going running with Skwerl and Rabbit's Foot. I love running. Really it requires no skill to run , just a pair of legs. But the sports like Cross Country and track do require the will to hone the ability to run and use your legs. I know all the other people in sports can run, but I also know that very few of them would have been able to do what we did in Cross Country. Oh, that makes me so proud. I still miss and love soccer though. I can't wait for school to start again. It's gotten so much easier lately, but I know that midterms are coming up in January so...but second quarter is so much easier than first quarter. The only class I truly hate is Algebra, but that is because it's basically a review of eigth grade math and my teacher is a skunk. I like talking to Amanda and Cory and Sara and RYAN (see, I know the name! *giggles*) in that class. Sometimes I ask Mrs. M stupid questions like why everything we learn we already were taught last year, and I do feel bad about it after I say them but I can't help it! It's sheer distaste for that class! Mrs. M just laughs it off and says I really should join the mock trial/debate team. Pshhhhh.... Grrrr the first day back at school is an A day. I hate A days. They're so boring. Grrr. But then Tuesday is a B day. I lurrrrrve B days. I love Creative Writing and Spanish and ..... well I don't love Algebra but I love Guitar. Our first indoor track meet is December ninth. I think that for the bus ride there I'm going to wear my Polar Bear pajamas over my uniform just for fun, since we won't have gotten our warm-ups (sweat pants, hoodies, etc.) by then. Our uniforms really suck, and they're white with blue lining and red lettering. I like the Cross Country uniforms so much better, even if they are a cross between wrestling and basketball uniforms. I'm looking for the perfect notebook. I know that sounds psycho, but you know what? I AM PSYCHO! Okay, on with the show: I am looking for the perfect notebook. My spiral notebooks stink because the covers won't turn the right way, and in composition notebooks it's hard to tear out pages (in fact, it's nearly impossible for me...). I can imagine the notebook now: A folder built in inside the front cover and another folder built into the inside of the back cover and easy-to-tear-out pages. The front cover would hold my artwork; the back cover would hold my music and the pages would hold my writings! Oh, so perfect! Anyway...
*sniff* Arghhh. I talked to Hannah today. She's in B.A. now, and I guess her internet and phone were screwed up for a while. She says she misses OM, and wants me to take pictures and stuff. I will, hopefully I'll remember. I kind of wish she would have contacted me somehow, but I guess I understand that all this packing up and moving must be hard for her. All my friends from school think that her being gone has been good for me, and I have been having a really great year this year. I was curious though. Anyway... I'm still catching up on my posts, but I'm almost there. I also thought of this wonderful new story idea, and I'm working it out now. Oh, I'm so happy. I'm watching Moulin Rouge and writing about ten million different things at once and I'm just so happy. It's finally sunk in that I don't have school AT ALL until MONDAY! Hallelujah! I love Moulin Rouge! *does happy dance* On Friday my whole family and my dad's friend (and his wife) are going to a concert for the TranSiberian (sp?) Orchestra. It's like classical music meets electric rock. AWESOME! Well, I'm not really into that kind of music, but John's been trying to get me into other genre's of music so I think this will be good for me. Mom and Dad loved it last year, so it's all good! Everyone at school is coming down with the flu. It's supposed to be really bad this year. Almost the whole sophomore class has it, and I didn't even know until Mandy got it and skipped school for three days, gave it to Krista and Eric, and Kate came down with something too. Those are the only sophomores I really know (besides the other Track geeks *winks*), so I'm waiting for the flu to pass through the sophomores and seniors and weed it's way to the Juniors and Freshmen and eventually infect the entire school so we can all be caught in the epidemic together *takes deep breath* 'Cause we are living In a material world And I am a material girl!' Madonna and Moulin Rouge. *smiles* My dad thinks Moulin Rouge is corrupt and horrible. He has 'No desire or interest in seeing the movie!' Grrr. I like it, it's so cool. Maybe I drank too much Pop (that's soda for all you North-Eastern people making fun of me!) tonight. *giggles* I keep cracking my knuckles even though it's realllllllly bad for me. 'We don't need no education We don't need no thought control No dark sarcasm in the classroom Teachers leave them kids alone All in all you're just another brick in the wall...' I love Pink Floyd. 'If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding! HOW can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?' The Wall is so cool, but nothing can compare to the Dark Side of the Moon! Okay, enough chit-chat. I'm off to write and watch Moulin Rouge at the same time. Yup, people, it's called multi-tasking, and I'm so good at it.
Hmmmm it's been a while. Nothing is really going on. On Monday the 17th we started the indoor track season. A lot of people came, almost a hundred kids. Over half of them were girls. Only seven or eight were freshmen girls. Jenn from soccer showed up, and of course Rabbits Foot. I wasn't worried about the size of our team. By Thursday only thirty girls were left. Granted that is more than the whole Cross-Country team ever was, everyone said that more people would give up by the first cold streak. On Friday night I went to Kendra's for a sleepover. Rabbit was there, and two girls that I didn't know but were friends of Kendra's: Sam and Mariana. It was so much fun! We went to blockbuster in our pajamas (well, I was in my pajamas...) and it was so much fun. We watched movies all night and only slept for two or three hours. LoL. Then on Saturday we went to the airport and took a flight to Minneapolis. IT WAS SNOWING!!! Whoot! Anyway, we ate dinner at my aunt's house, and drove on south to grandma and grandpa's. We were just there in July and my grandparents aren't doing so well since then. Grandpa fell and apparently it was really bad, and he can barely walk, and the doctors think that his eye problem might be a tumor. That, and his cancer...Grandma is starting to lose her pretty red hair from the chemo. We just got back today, and it's all good. I have a lot of catching up to do, and none of it is for school. *grins* I have a lot of posts to write up, a lot of people to talk to, and a whole new story idea to write up! I love having a week of vacation though!

Hey everyone. I tried to update the layout, but I had computer troubles so I just changed the title and the header/introduction. I'm computer challenged, okay? Lay off....*grumbles* Nah, just kidding. Ahh, so indoor track starts Monday. Fun, fun, fun! Goodie. No, really though. I'm scared to death that I won't do well in track, but maybe that's just because I did so well in Cross Country (got my Varsity letter and everything on Wednesday!) and I don't want to fail. Ha! That sounds so melodramatic, I know, but what can you do? Amanda seems to be having good luck with boys. Good for her! And I won't say anything more, lest I be "damned to the furthest reaches of Hell by the power of the Almighty Lord" (sorry for using the name in vain! Amanda's sorry too!) and never spoken to again. Hey, that sounded melodramatic too, but what can you do? Kendra and Keniesha and I are going to have a big sleepover on the 21st, apparently. I dunno what we're gonna do, but they're two of my best friends, so I trust them. OOH! Maybe we could go see The Cat In the Hat! I live for those kiddie stories. I watch the old animated Grinch every year. Well, its a VHS tape so we have to watch it in Shelby's room, but its tradition. I also love thing 1 and thing 2 from the Cat in the Hat, so... Man, I've been writing poetry like a maniac. I swear, its like I'm a poetry monster all of a sudden. Not all of its good, I know that for a fact. But it's poetry, and it's MINE! All MINE! Created entirely by ME! It's all because of the poetry assignment in Creative Writing. Dr. M said she got a reporter from the Washington Post to come and do a spread on our "Coffee House" that we're having in late Dec. COOL! Things Accomplished: 1) U.S. Government Report/Current Event on the Executive Branch - Completed in thirty minutes and written on the partial-birth abortion bill...well, law... 2) Nine pages of chapter one (of book TWO!) - Completed in one and a half days with a serious philisophical discussion...kind of...err... 3) Watched "Finding Nemo" twice. DORI IS SO COOL! Oh, and that French cleaner crab, Jacque, is so cool! 4) Finished thirteen poems for Creative Writing - Completed throughout this week, and more are to come, I'm sure. Things To Do 1) Run sometime before Monday, since track starts then. Gargh. 2) Rearrange my room, so that my stereo and my keyboard, guitar, and other music stuff are all near the same wall. That sucks when I want to play along to a song and my stereo is on the other side of the room. Especially since the battery to the stereo remote mysteriously disappeared...*eyes dart* 3) Figure out what Math homework was! *scratches head* 4) WRITE MORE! *giggles* 5) Errr....I'll get back to you... YAWN! G'night, people!

Everyone on the team was there except for Katharina and Allison. The people running were Larry, Kate, and the Varsity boy's team. I guess Coach Lawton didn't want to hack up the cash for a nice coach bus for the STATE MEET, so we took a crappy yellow school bus. The ride was a little less than a hour, since we were going to that dreaded place that you might recall from a month and a half ago: HEREFORD! Y'know, the course that was perfectly fine and hilly except for that one "killer" ravine hill? Yeah, there. It was freeeeeezing out! Kendra and I bought shirts, and then we got hot chocolate before going to watch the boy's 3A school race (we were 4A, so our boys didn't go yet). We went to the one hill, and to our relief, not one person fell during that race. Will Eden was supposed to win, but he got beat out at the last 100 metres. Poor Will. Then we waited around for a while and made David get us hotdogs (LOL!). Then we ran back down/up that one hill to watch our boys run the 4A race. None of them fell, thank the Lord, and Larry did pretty well. He got fourth in the state, but he was disappointed in himself for not getting under seventeen minutes. Err, his time was 17:00:05, but whatever. That's about six or seven minutes better than my time! LoL. I just don't get Larry. Umm, Tommy and P Berry beat Pappas, and Pappas seemed really surprised about it afterwards. Other than that...yeah, nothing. Then Kendra and I ran BACK down/up that one hill for the third time to watch the girl's 3A race. We were rooting for SP and Annapolis because they were the only teams we recognized from the season. Whoop Whoo. Grrrrr. Then we went back down/up that one hill to watch Kate run in the girl's 4A race. Of course, Lauren C. from the Bruins was first place in that race. Her time was 19:01:01, and she beat most of the good guys that ran. I was happy for her though, and she deserved this because since she started running as a Freshman, she hasn't lost one race (or so I've heard). Good for Lauren. Kate was upset because she didn't do as well as she did last year. Ok, I don't get Kate sometimes either, since her time was good too, and at least she made it to states. Then we went to the awards ceremony, and yada yada. Larry got fourth and got a medal and we left for home. On Sunday I did nothing. On Monday I did nothing. Today I started Book Two, finally! Everything is posted at: www.fictionpress.com/~dreamsong Under the story titled, "Song of the Sea" It is the unedited version though, but I'm okay with it. YO! *giggles* Time for bed!

So we were at the Regional Cross Country Championships and... Larry got first place for the boys race, and is thusly going to states this coming Saturday. Kate got sixth place for the girls race, and is thusly going to states this coming Saturday. The OM boys TEAM got sixth place by TWO POINTS, and is BARELY going to states this coming Saturday. The OM girls team got fourth place by TWENTY-THREE points (argh!) and is thusly NOT going to states. My season is over. At least I beat Jessica. Yeah, that's right. I kept cheering her on, telling her not to walk the hills, and those walked hills came back to haunt her when I sprinted the last three-hundred metres. I was flying, I swear. Not even bragging, either, because I am in no position to brag compared to Kate and Katharina, but I just felt like I was flying. I feel so bad for Alex, though. Coach had to send in a roster of ten names, and that was the roster he could pick from for all the final meets (Counties, Regionals, and States). He forgot Alex. If your name wasn't on the roster, you don't get a tag. You haven't got a tag, you sure as hell aren't going to run. Colin would have been next in line, but he said that he "wasn't going if I'm not going to run." So, he would have actually ran if he had gone! Gasp. So, Chris K. had to run. Chris did pretty well. We were all happy and cheering when the boys got to states. By two points. Coach had a look on his face that spelled out his complete disbelief, which confirms his unconfident manner with his team, and I knew he wanted to say (but didn't) "No (maybe the F word? Nah) way. No way." Anyway, so my season is over. I still have to go to practice though. Argh. Oh well. Track is up soon. I went to the Homecoming game today. I didn't really pay attention to the game that much but I know we won, only by like one touchdown. I love football, but not on the high school level. I was too busy hanging with Kendra, Marisa, and Robyn. I got to see Matt again, my old paper boy. He really is a nice guy, but I don't think he likes me at all, not even as a friend. Which I don't understand at all, because I was totally not mean to him in Middle School like SOME PEOPLE! I need to lighten up, despite the fact that this week hasn't been the best week of my life.

Wow. Seven more hours and another year will have passed. Mom's birthday is at 3AM technically (Yes, she's a New Years baby) and that will kick off another New Year. A whole year gone by. That's good. In many ways to me it's felt like 2004 for a few months. I'm totally ready for another clean slate. Actually, it never feels like a clean slate to me until the next New Years rolls around and I realize how different I have become. Six things that 2003 taught you: 1) High School isn't the hell that I feared - Middle School was as bad as it got (so far!). 2) Friends are good things to keep around. 3) There is a major difference between "good" and "best" friends. 4) Trust is a privelage - You earn it and have to keep it; it's precious. 5) All you need is love. 6) People play favorites, even if they're convinced that they don't. Six new people you've met or became close with in 2003: 1) Keniesha. 2) Kendra. 3) Sara. 4) Amanda. 5) David. 6) Ryan. Five things you want to do in 2004: 1) Get organised. 2) Learn how not to let things bother me... 3) Show people that I can do what they didn't think I could (that probably makes no sense to anyone but me and Kendra and Keniesha). 4) Remind Kate that she's only a Sophomore and that she was a Freshman too, once, since her head seems to have gotten really big. (This will probably be achieved through Track). 5) Be more confident. Nine personally significant events of 2003: 1) I turned fourteen. 2) I started High School. 3) I got a general idea of what I want to do with my life. 4) I lost people I thought were "friends" and gained people who I knew were friends. 5) I found out that even though soccer isn't my thing -- running is. 6) I realized and learned what things I could never live without. 7) I started choosing my own path for who I am and not letting others choose for me. 8) I let the real me come out (Oh, this is funny). 9) I'm happy. Five things I don't want to do in 2004: 1) Lose all my new, closer friends. 2) Die. 3) Have anyone else I love die (that's a hard thing). 4) Rush life. 5) Grow up too soon. Six songs that you over listened to this year: 1) My Last Breath/My Immortal - Evanescence 2) The Saddest Song - The Ataris 3) Mephistopheles Returns/Maybe Then - The Tans-Siberian Orchestra. 4) Empty Handed/One of These Days - Michelle Branch 5) Another Brick In the Wall Part Two/ Comfortably Numb - Pink Floyd. 6) My Greatest Day / And I Ran (Cover Song Flock of Seagulls) - Bowling for Soup. Seven things you truly regret from 2003: 1) It took me so long to get rid of (or be gotten rid of) Alex and Paula and them. 2) All else is trivial. 3) 4) 5) 6) 7) Five things you wish people understood about you: 1) I'm a lot more fun once you get to know me. I'm not good with first impressions. 2) Music is my lifeblood. The arts are my needs. 3) Running is important to me, so is Tae Kwon Do. 4) I am a good listener, really, I am. 5) I am independent...and headstrong. Get over it. :) BRING IT ON, 2004!!!!!!!
Today's feature presentation: Payback's a Killer (Bitch) I haven't slept in once this whole winter vacation. Not once. Last night I went with Mandy to a lock-in at the firehouse. We took a bus to go and see Train Gardens set up by other fire stations. Then we went back to the firehouse and hung out. Everyone was determined not to go to sleep because Joe had threatened to 'get us' with shaving cream. So we decided to wait for him to go to sleep and 'get him' with shaving cream and blue hair spray/dye. Mandy made an attempt but got sprayed with Joe's CoolWhip can in return. Yeah that stuff smells like fish if you don't keep it in the fridge or eat it. Then we all started getting tired. This little girl who was about 12 had all this makeup out saying she was going to draw on people's faces. Yeah, she got me about twelve times when I didn't expect it and so I had blue and brown and pink eyeliner and lipliner all over my face. Eventually I got pissed off enough and when she dared to ask me if I was mad I told her that I was really mad and that if she touched me again I would take the blue hair spray/dye on her. This made her go into the girl's bathroom and cry. Mandy went in to see what her problem was and she said that she was crying because when I was around she wasn't having any fun. *rolls eyes* Okay, so everyone but the chaperones are sleeping by 5 AM. Then Miss Sue tells someone to wake me and Mandy up since we were leaving early at about 6. Others start waking up, including the crying 12-year-old named Sarah. Lots of people stay asleep though. Sarah goes around with shaving cream and sprays Joe, Robby, Kelly, and three other people in the face. Then Joe got so mad that he grabbed the shaving cream from her and sprayed the remaining parts of the can in her hair on the top of her head! Sarah starts wailing and crying and goes to the bathroom, slipping on cream on the way and falling to the ground once or twice. When she walks out Miss Sue laughs and says 'Yeha, Payback is a killer, ain't it?' and everyone starts clapping and cheering for Joe. Everyone was so incredibly pissed at Sarah that they were clapping for her shaving creamed - hair. Yeha! Then she went and cried some more in the bathroom as the guys cleaned up her shaving cream mess. And now I haven't slept in over 24 hours.

AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! GREEN BAY IS GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All they had to do was beat the Denver Broncos, and the Cardinals had to beat the Vikings. Beating the Broncos was no problem, it was 31 to 3. But the Cardinals were losing 17 to 6 with four minutes left, and then THERE WAS THE PASSSSS!!! They had to review it, but IT STOOD! THE PACKERS ARE GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!! *calms down* Whooooo! EDIT: Lookie here if you've no idea what I'm rambling about: http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2003/12/28/1/
Ummmm okay. On Tuesday morning I set my alarm clock to go off at 7:00 so I could get ready for track at 8:30. My dad comes in my room at 8:15 and asks me if I'm going, because I was still in bed, with my alarm clock going off! Apparantly it wasn't loud enough so I slept right through it! Grrr. So I got ready in five minutes and we left at 8:20 and got to the track at just a bit after 8:30. Coooool. Wednesday night we went to 7PM Christmas mass. It was very cool with the caroling and whatnot. The girl behind me was very annoying, though. She recited (well, murmured) everything that they say at mass (like, when Father Nick begins the mass and starts the first reading and blesses the bread etc.). If it wasn't something they say every mass she would repeat it and follow along, whispering everything they'd say. She sang (VERY LOUDLY) along with every song, which, uhh, I sang too, but uhhh...okay so her singing was very good. Nevermind. Scratch that. I dunno I guess the only reason I'm ragging on her is because the rest of the mass was so perfect that I can't really make fun of anything else. *laughs* Thursday morning was very cool. Lots of gifts for everyone, and everyone got what they wanted, I think. I didn't get a lot of clothes because my parents are always afraid it won't fit or I won't like it, so I got some gift cards. I got a few Guitar Hangers so that my dad can hook them to the wall and I can hang my guitars up on the wall. VERY COOL! OH YEAH! Ummm a book about Joan of Arc (I'm obsessed, and her story is why I'm so anxious to get Confirmed) called "Joan d'Arc in Her Own Words" and I got the DVD Joan of Arc (the version with LeeLee Sobieski in it). Very cool. Ummm, I got a few CDs, lots of candy/chocolate, ummm. OH YEAH! My dad bought me a white Tae Kwon Do uniform! Oh, I know that you're thinking, well, uhh, white belts have white uniforms. Well, he got me the white pullover-tunic uniform with a black collar, which means only black belts can wear them! Ooh I've wanted one since I was a red belt, and thought of getting one for myself ever since I got my black belt back in early April. Yay for white uniforms! Oh, I also got a lot of Navy stuff! GO NAVY! So we spent most of Thursday doing the Christmas thing and watching our new movies etc. Uhhh, what else....Grandma Char called. She sounded lonely, and I know she misses Grandpa. Dad says it's probably that she's tired from the Chemotherapy. I dunno. Today I went to track practice and came home and finished cleaning up my room. Then at 12 mom took me and Shelby to the mall to take advantage of the after-Christmas sales. We didn't spend much of our money or gift cards, since most of the clothes and stuff at the mall is the same old stuff just on sale. So we left and came back home. I cleaned my bathroom so it's spotless and beautiful, because Aunt Kathleen and the twins (Mark and Brad) are coming down from Michigan tonight. They got stuck on the Pennsylvania turnpike so they won't be here until Midnight, they said. Anyway, I have to go hide my cats for when the twins get here. I know they're only ten days younger than I am, but they're obsessed with attacking the cats! I also need to figure out a way to keep my room safe in a way that they can't lockpick! Those darn troublemakers! They're still kind of cool, though! Honest...
Oh Lord so much has happened in the last week! On Monday the fifteenth Grandpa Bernie died in the home that they'd put him in three days previous. He was 81 years, 11 months, and 21 days old. He died while I was at school running track. Thank God we went to visit during Thanksgiving and not for Christmas break, or we would have missed seeing him by a mere week or so. I miss him so much! Oh God it's so hard to think that I'll never see him again! It's so hard, but thanks to all my friends and acquaintances, the pain isn't nearly as hard to bear as it could have been. Everyone is so supportive! I love ya'll! Not much happened on Tuesday. Holy crap (it sounds so vulgar, I know, but this is sooooo weird!). On Wednesday I go into third period Biology and it's business as usual until 11:55 when our D lunch bell was supposed to ring. Well, it was supposed to ring...but, well...it didn't. Then the Principal comes on the announcements and blares out: "NO ONE HAS BEEN HURT, I ASSURE YOU!" and then his voice calms down and he doesn't explain why anyone would be hurt in the first place, and insteads decided to explain that police have surrounded the High school and two connected Middle schools and, alas, that everyone would stay in their third period classes. This means that the C lunch kids were stuck in perpetual lunch-ness while we poor, deprived Science hall students were to get no lunch. 12:00 ticks by, and Mrs. McC pops in the DVD "Finding Nemo". 12:30 ticks by, and Principal comes on the announcements just to reassure that despite the fact that we have NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON....no one has been hurt. 1:00 ticks by, and all the tenth graders in the class that failed last year start complaining that they're hungry and that a movie about fish does nothing to help. 1:15 ticks by, and Mrs. McC goes to the bathroom, and everyone gets pissed because they're not allowed to go to the bathroom. 1:30 ticks by, and Finding Nemo starts winding down. 1:55 ticks by, and Principal comes on the PA system and says that he sent a letter for the students to bring home and that students will be dismissed shortly. 2:15 ticks by, and the students are let out of the classroom twenty minutes later than their usual school-ending time. We were only allowed out of two exits, and the police only searched boys with ski caps and baggy clothing. No one was allowed anywhere on the bottom floor after dismissal without a teacher unless they were going to the exits. Thusly I was not allowed to get my WINTER COAT. Grrr. All after school activities were canceled. I go outside without a letter since Mrs. McC forgot to give us ours. And, with my incredible luck, it's pouring outside and my bus isn't there. The buses started leaving, and my bus and one other bus had yet to arrive. Again, with the apparant occulation of any luck I once (or [n]ever) had, it began to hail outside. And I with my simple long-sleeved T-shirt on. 2:30 and my bus still hasn't showed up. IT STARTED TO SNOW. Yes, snow. Then my bus showed up at 2:45. I found out more about the 'incident' on the 4 and 5 o'clock news than I did from our dear old Principal. Apparantly some student smuggled a gun into school and shot it in the gym hallway. I guess NO ONE WAS HURT, as Mr. L kept on insisting over the PA. And, for a news update: the boy who brought the gun to school was apparantly caught while I was in Minnesota. Yay. We had to delay our flight for MN from Thursday night to Friday morning. EARLY Friday morning. So I wake up at four AM on Fri. morning to catch the flight. Black clothing in tow, I was met with about half an airport full of US Army dudes and dudettes going home for the holidays. I was filled with some kind of pride that only the sight of one Army guy being chastised by my retired Senior Chief in the Navy mother for putting his bag over his shoulder when wearing his dress uniform. Friday was the wake. It was incredibly sad. So much sadder than I'd anticipated. I couldn't go up to the open casket. I couldn't. Aunt Sondra said she'd go with me if I wanted her to, but I didn't think I could. Then Jovana took me up there, and I couldn't bear it. His face....it was so....sunken in.... Anyway... Saturday was the funeral. I said goodbye to grandpa and the service was very nice. Jo said a poem and Uncle Gary spoke during the commentation time. They played Amazing Grace. The rest of Saturday and Sunday was spent visiting with family. We got home today at 5:30. I was so happy to be home. Now apparantly I have track practice tomorrow at 8:30 AM and I need to find a ride home since my mom can drive me there but not back. Christmas is in two days, I think. Oh and on Christmas-Eve-Day I'm going with my dad and Jett Robb (LoL) to see Return of the King. Oh God I've wanted to see it for so long but it's been such a busy week. Then I'll go to Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve since that's the one with the candles, and then it will be Christmas Morning! Oh, but how I wish it was that simple. You are a freeform writer. Individualistic with a sense for the different and challenging, Walt Whitman and his poetry lacking meter and rhyme is just what the doctor ordered. You're quick to write something that the rest of the world doesn't accept as poetry, quick to separate yourself from the average joe. An author with a true sense of self, you have confidence in your abilities and aren't afraid to show it. :) GO YOU! urlLink What's YOUR Writing Style? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla Yuppers, that's me! 50% How Dumb Are You? by The Traveller Awwwwwww I wish I could touch my tongue to my nose! *sticks tongue out with sarcastic stupidity* Which Founding Father Are You?
Saddam Hussein has been captured. Really, I don't think I was really for the war in Iraq at all (I mean, what ever happened to finding Osama and hanging around in Afghanistan?), but I'm a military child through and through, and I think this is a good thing. I found it really strange though that for some man who was willing to stand his ground despite threats of war just willingly gave himself in. He had a gun, but NO shots were fired. I just found that strange. I seriously seriously hope there is no school tomorrow. I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! I can't wait till holiday break. Five more days, five more days, five more days....*mutters feverishly*
Today I went to Church for a teen Christmas Project. All the Middle Schoolers and four of us High Schoolers (even though it was supposed to be a HS thing in the first place *rolls eyes*) came to Church and made pretty bags and filled them with donated goodies for the people less fortunate during the holiday season. Then we made disgusting sandwiches made of rye bread, mustard, some mix between salami and bologna, and nasty cheese. Yummy. I'm so tired. It's supposed to rain/sleet/ice/snow on Sunday, so hopefully we won't have any school. That's an A day so I really hope we don't have school. I love B days.
Oh God it's been such a hectic week. Mom left for a business trip on Tuesday in California. So basically that means dad is cooking all week...errrr...and Mom is coming back Friday around midnight. That will be a good day, despite the fact that by then I will have collapsed in a coma from lack of sleep and over-extending my physical energy. *sigh* Tuesday right after school we got on the nice coach buses for the first track meet at PGSLC. Girls got one bus and boys got another, since the coaches said it would be easier to keep track of who's there and who isn't. I sat next to Jenn, and Kendra came and sat with Keneisha. The bus ride there was only about 45 minutes, so we weren't too bored. When we got off it was freezing outside, but when we got inside to the track and field arena it was boiling. Hot, DRY air. We sat on bleachers between Glen Burnie and North East. My event was first! God. Okay, I was only running in two events: the 4 by 8 (or 3200, 2-mile relay), which means four people each run eight-hundred meters, and I also ran the 800m run. The 3200 Girls relay was first! And I was the last girl from our team to run. We prayed on our pink baton, and walked out onto the track. Emily went first, and she kept up her spot as third in the group. Then Katharina went, and at first she was sprinting hella fast, but as was to be expected, she tired herself out and got us to fourth place I think. Then Jessica went and did really well, and then it was my turn. I think I did okay for my first indoor track race, and I even passed two girls so that our team was in fourth. Cooooool. Not bad, not bad. But my next race wouldn't be until about three hours later, so I watched all my other OM buddies run. Most of the girls ran sprints, but Kathleen and Kate ran the 1600 (one mile) race. Umm, we had only one disqualification, and it was on the 500m dash. I think it was for a false start. The second to last race was my 800m race. I was in the 3rd heat, and there were about ten other girls along with me. Coach Keith teases me now saying I'm the best starter on the team since I didn't let those girls shove me to the back of the line. I did pretty well on that race. We left the arena at about nine oclock, or close to that. We got home at 9:40 and I didn't get a ride home and walk through the door until 10. I took a shower and finished the last of my homework and didn't get to bed until 11. I was so tired on Wednesday. So tired. Ummm, today was okay. In US GOVT, only seven people passed this one Division of Powers test we took a few weeks ago, so everyone but the seven people had to retake it. So we all (yeah baby, I'm one of the people who passed it!) moved to the back and got to do whatever we wanted for twenty minutes. I passed notes with Amanda and Sarah and listened to music. Then today we did our run-a-thon for Track. I got three pledges, btu they're all from my family. One dollar a lap from dad, one dollar a lap from mom, and twenty cents a lap from Shelby. I ran six miles (I know, it's slow for me, but hey, I feel like jello by the end of the week), or 24 laps. Whoot whoot! I need to go do some homework!
Listening to: Requiem (The Fifth Symphony), TSO Hmm... Thursday *Walking to the Track for practice* Sarah: You distance runners are psycho. Maybe I should do sprinting. Anyway, yesterday, we were running that loop and I kept thinking of the song Dori sings in Finding Nemo. "Just keep swimming, just keep swimming..."

( To door ) We have school, don't we? Mother: I'm sorry, darling, there's no school today. M-dogg: ( grunting, wanting to throw the pillow at the door ) Then why are you waking me up at 5:30 AM? Mother: I love you too, dear. I'm going to work now! M-dogg: ( Uninterested snoring ensues ) Saturday *At 9:30 AM* Mallory: ( Walking up the stairs and seeing 6 inches of snow outside the kitchen window) YES! YES! ( jumping up and down ) LOOK AT ALL THAT POWDER BABY!! *At 12:30 PM* Mallory: ( grumbling ) Snow sucks. Sunday *3:30 PM* Mallory: Math sucks, too. Mallory: ( Twenty minutes later ) Needing extra credit work for math sucks too! Mallory: ( Throwing pencil down ) I quit!
HAH! NO SCHOOL! My mom woke me up this morning at 5:30 and said she had bad news. I was like, "We have school, don't we?" and she said, "No, there's no school." I was so happy! Then I went back to bed and didn't wake up until 7:30, and even then I just went upstairs to see the snow and go sleep on the couch. I feel so rested, and not only that, but on Monday it's a B DAY again! YES!!! I'm so glad we had no school today. THANK YOU, SNOW!!! I'm going to be catching up on posts today, since I'm really behind. LoL. Umm, not much else really.

Blargh. Nothing really happened today. It's supposed to snow tonight and tomorrow morning so I'm really really really praying for no school, or at least a two hour late opening so I can sleep in. Today in Algebra Mrs. M changed our seats. I sit behind some tall dude, I sit next to AMANDA and I sit in front of Cory....Then on our brain break I answered three trivia questions correctly and I got three lollipops. I gave the blueberry one to Amanda, the I-can't-remember-what-flavor-it-is to Jenny, and the mystery (he says it was Apple, no butterscotch...well, he couldn't decide) to Ryan.

Oh Lord, Monday. I asked my mom to wake me up this morning, since I kept setting my clock over the weekend (You know, to get back into the swing of things) and I was either sleeping through it or it just wasn't going off. Anyway, my mom knocks on the door and says, "Wake up, Mal, it's six oclock." You know what I said? "Yeah, so? Why are you waking me up so early?" Argh I just hated it today. I would have been more awake if it had been a B day. I love B days. On my current event report for US Govt about the new law (which they're already challenging) about partial-birth control I got an A. 100%, in fact. Go me. I think it's just because I'm very opinionated on current event projects and whatnot. Anyway... *Sigh* There's not much to say now... We decorated our home for Christmas yesterday. Oooh ahhhh. Our house looks really cool outside and our tree is really pretty. We started lighting the Advent wreath yesterday too. Christmas will be here soon, and all I have for gifts for others is Lacross balls for Shelby. I have to go shopping...grrrrrrr
Oooh. Tests. Exams. Oooh, so much fun. Mucho fun... Thursday I had Biology and Government exams. It was a two hour late opening into school because of the icy roads and stuff, so I was all awake for the tests which I guess kind of helped. Biology had four BCR's and the rest was I think 65 mutliple choice questions. It wasn't too hard but there were some questions that I had to read about five times just to figure out what the hell they were saying. Confuzzling. Then I went to the break and hung out in the one spot that I always did...dunno why...but for some reason everyone was acting really hyper. It was strange...Then I went to Government with the eighty-year old pregnant man (*cough*BRIGHT*cough*) and it wasn't half as hard as I thought it would be. THe only trouble I had was remembering what the hell the different economic systems were and the legal ways to change a law. Other than that I don't think I did too bad. Friday I had Creative Writing and Spanish II. Creative Writing required us to be exhaustingly creative on our exam with a total of two hours to be able to be such. I think I did well on everything but the One-Act Play part. What the hell is a 'dramatis personae'? I said it was the stage directions! Hah! I guessed. Completely. But then we got our final projects back and mine was a 300/300. I was very pleased. Then I went to the break. It kind of sucked...I don't know...nevermind. It wasn't good, but it wasn't bad. Kind of...Blah. Keniesha gave me sour cream and onion pringles so my breath was stinking. LoL. I admit it! Then Spanish was pretty damn easy since it was all multiple choice. Track was boring. Jessica 'broke her foot' so I wanted to take her spot in the 3200m Relay so I could maybe get that last point I needed to get my letter, but NO! Emily came up and said 'For the 3200 sign up me, Kate, AMY, and Katharina'. Urrrrrgh I was so mad. So I made my own 3200m Relay team. There's no way in hell we can beat Kate's team *rolls eyes*, but me, Shanika, Brittney, and Sarah can run our asses off! I'm also doing my usual 3200 open, the damned 2-mile. Today was boring. Oh, but good news - I got an A on my English Exam! Whoot! She told us during attendance. I was happy. Eeeeeee.

Hmm. I ended up getting three days off of school and then tomorrow it's gonna be a two hour late opening. Sounds good, ne? Except I'm really worried about that last regular meet on Feb. 3. Because if we have school on Thursday, Friday, and Monday to complete Mid-Term Finals, then Tuesday and Wednesday will be the in-service workdays off. That means that with no school on Tues, we won't have a meet. They'll either cancel it entirely or postpone it. I need two more points to be Varsity. But if they cancel the meet than that would lower the number of points needed, since it goes by having an average of one point per meet. I can only pray. I've done nothing more than write this whole three days. Oh, I slept and watched movies, too. Other than that...not much. Hmmm. I want to take pictures at the next Track meet. I've been scrapbooking everything. I've been a little sad lately, too. I guess only Keniesha and Kendra know why, but I'm getting over something...or trying...teehee...but it sucks. Loving someone who doesn't love you back. It hurts. Please don't laugh at the sappy songs I add to this now! I'd Rather Be in Love I cannot help it I couldn't stop it if I tried The same old heartbeat Feels the emptiness I have inside And I've heard that you can't fight love So I won't complain 'Cause why would I stop the fire That keeps me going on Turn out the lights now To see is to believe I just want you near me Just want you here with me And I'd give up everything Only for you It's the least that I could do [Chorus] And when there's you I feel whole And there's no better Feeling in the world But without you I'm alone And I'd rather be in love With you. Why are we afraid to be in love To be loved I can't explain it I know it's tough To be loved Okay, so I guess I need to study. *Sighs*
No school today! I woke up at 5:30 to take my shower or go back to bed if it was canceled, and my mom said that they hadn't decided! They'd decided to close every other county, but ours couldn't make up their mind! I mean, hey, there was only like a foot of snow on the ground! I think it was some serious bull that they couldn't decide, considering that people need to get to their buses at 6:30, they should decide by five so people can get ready! Then I slept till six and my dad called to say there was no school. Then I slept till nine, watched TV until ten, and here I am. Watching the snow fall, writing, and studying. Okay, well I'm not really studying, but it's encouraging to say that I am. I dunno. I feel like going ice skating. Maybe I could call Kendra and Keniesha and go ice skating with them. Or have a snowball fight, but then again I don't feel like putting on a bunch of snow clothes stuff. Have you ever met someone who liked to say they were the best at everything? Someone who also owned the best of everything? In short, someone PERFECT? Or, someone who liked to pretend to be perfect? Man, it sucks. Maybe I'm just jealous. Maybe. No! I'm never jealous! I'm perfect! No, wait...that made no sense...oh well. Nevermind. I haven't run in almost a week. It sucks. Especially since I need to win that meet on the third of February to get my letter. I guess we don't have practice today though...teehee...
I've been feeling like serious crap since the weekend started. I haven't gone anywhere at all. I just don't feel good, I feel lethargic. Amanda came over yesterday, but other than that...nothing. I hate it, but I just don't want to do anything. The only productive things I've done all weekend was sleep, play guitar, fold laundry, and study. Pathetic. Mom and Dad say there's a huge chance that there won't be any school tomorrow. That's good. Really good. That gives me an extra day to study and not worry about the Government final. So, yes, I really want snow. Quizzesssssssss.

You've been warned! You are a PHOENIX in your soul and your wings make a statement. Huge and born of flame, they burn with light and power and rebirth. Ashes fall from your wingtips. You are an amazingly strong person. You survive, even flourish in adversity and hardship. A firm believer in the phrase, 'Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger,' you rarely fear failure. You know that any mistake you make will teach you more about yourself and allow you to 'rise from the ashes' as a still greater being. Because of this, you rarely make the same mistake twice, and are not among the most forgiving people. You're extremely powerful and wise, and are capable of fierce pride, passion, and anger. Perhaps you're this way because you were forced to survive a rough childhood. Or maybe you just have a strong grasp on reality and know that life is tough and the world is cruel, and it takes strength and independence to survive it. And independence is your strongest point - you may care for others, and even depend on them...but when it comes right down to it, the only one you need is yourself. Thus you trust your own intuition, and rely on a mind almost as brilliant as the fire of your wings to guide you.You are eternal and because you have a strong sense of who and what you are, no one can control your heart or mind, or even really influence your thinking. A symbol of rebirth and renewal, you tend to be a very spiritual person with a serious mind - never acting immature and harboring a superior disgust of those who do. Likewise, humanity's stupidity and tendency to want others to solve their problems for them frustrates you endlessly.

Hmmmm. Finals started today! I don't know why everyone says they are so bad, they were so much fun! I was really hyper today. Teehee. Finals rocked! Mine were so easy today. Even though I have the really hard classes left, I still think I'll do fine like I did today. Let me explain! English was very easy. There were questions about literary devices, like similes and metaphors and personification and stuff like that. There were also a lot of questions about the stories and books we read. Like "Most Dangerous Game" (Connell), "Scarlet Ibis" (Hurst), "Cask of Amontillado" (Poe), "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" (Angelou), and "Lord of the Flies" (Golding). All of those were pretty easy. Then we had a lot of essays. They weren't hard though, a lot about theme and the Journies and stuff. Ahh, one big essay was about someone who inspires us, and I wrote about my friend Kendra and my Creative Writing teacher. LoL. I'm such a dork. Then I went to the cafeteria for the fifteen minute break and spent ten minutes of it looking for Kendra and Keniesha, only to find them back in the same place I started, sitting at the table near Nora, Pepe (Okay, her real name is Brianna!) and these other two girls (I think one of them was Becca? I dunno) and Ryan. Keniesha seemed kind of out of it, but maybe because I didn't have much of a chance to talk to her. Kendra was working on some project for P.E. (tisk tisk, Kendra.) and then the bell rang. I walked with Kendra until she went...errr, Oh yeah! She went to hand her P.E. paper even though she had Drafting. So I went to Keyboarding. Keyboarding was so easy that I won't even talk about it. I got home, and Shelby got home two hours later from school since she's a wee Middle Schooler. We actually got along for hours and made cupcakes and a cake for my dad's birthday. I went to Jason's before going out to dinner for dad's birthday dinner, and I saw Coach Keith there, since his wife teaches there. He gave me some really important news: I need two more points to qualify for my varsity letter. Now, I'm on a roll here with getting my Cross Country letter and all, so hopefully at the meet on February 3rd I'll get fifth or better in the two-mile and get those points that I need! Dad's dinner was fun, and we went home and I had a concert for my dad since he wanted to hear me on my guitar. I played "Another Brick in the Wall Prt. 2" For him, since Pink Floyd is about his favorite band of all time. I also played "And I Ran (So Far Away)" by Flock of Seagulls, and "Boys of Summer" by Don Henly. All those good eighties songs! I seem to be obsessed with them lately. Then my dad gave me the address to his music directory on the network and I'm listening to all these awesome songs! "Inspector Gadget", "Secret Agent Man", and loads of other funny songs! It's fun. Today was really cool. Very awesome.
Okay, yesterday really, truly sucked, so I won't think or talk about it anymore because what's done is done and the past shall remain the past. Anyway, tomorrow is the first day of finals. I have English and Keyboarding. Both should be pretty easy, I hope. Then on Saturday me and Amanda are going to study together for Government, Algebra, and Spanish. ARGH! About Algebra....MRS. M was being such a...Okay, I won't curse but...It really sucked. I retook her test on Tuesday and she said she wouldn't grade it and she wouldn't let me take her final unless I had given her a note for that day the bus didn't pick me up - - Remember, the day the office said that they would take care of it, and that it was a LEGAL ABSENCE?? I honestly can't stand Mrs. Meeer-a-bile. I'm tired, and hungry, but I need to study. MUST STUDY...MUST STUDY... *studies for five minutes* *goes and plugs her guitar into her amp* *ignores computer* *ignores study review sheets* *plays guitar*
Why does everybody hate me?
Hmmm. Last night we had another meet. Sarah and Jenn did really well, they both got Personal Records. Keniesha went and told all her friends that she won the 300m dash when, technically, she didn't. Well, she did win her heat with her and two other people in it, but she didn't win the entire race. Either way she did pretty well, but I don't know if she got a PR (Personal Record) or not because she won't talk to me. She's been ignoring me lately and she won't tell me why. Anyway, I ran the two-mile again. I still did way better than my first race, but I didn't do as good as my race last week. So, I didn't get a PR, but I didn't do horribly. My dad took me home after my race, so I actually got to sleep some. Today we had no practice so it was all good. Other than that, not a lot is happening. I'm writing behind-the-scenes like crazy on the BD, but I need to get back to actually posting, LoL. I'm working on a new game with Aman, which is incredibly fun but almost confusing just because it's really intricate. Then I have exams starting Friday, and I have English and Keyboarding this Friday. Cooool. But because it's exams I also get out two hours early, at 11:55. I probably have practice though. Grrr. Keniesha is mad at me. I don't know why. I just don't understand her sometimes. She just makes everything into a joke. Well, scratch that...it just seems like she doesn't take anything I say seriously because whenever I talk to her about something I'm really being serious and honest about she laughs or smiles and doesn't even answer. Then she told Kendra something about Nora not liking her, which I really think is not Keniesha's business anyway, it's just gossip which sucks and I know it does. I need to talk to Rabbit but I don't know what to tell her other than that she needs to keep secrets secret and keep herself to herself and take things seriously when they need to be taken seriously. Okay. I think I'm done now...
First of all, this year's playoffs were a serious disappointment. Patriots and Panthers *rolls eyes* Well, you can't get a good match every year. What really disappointed me though was that my team lost to a team that they could've beat, with a play they decided not to run. Oh well, there's always next year. I guess I'm rooting for the Panthers. Anyway, we had the Puffy Paint Party! We went to practice and did a free run for a while, and then when we came back to get our stuff we went to the track and we all carpooled to Coach Nelson's house. The guys all went to IHOP for a breakfast as their party thing, since we came up with the wonderful paint party idea. My shirt is okay but it does look kind of...weird. I need to wear a shirt under it because I cut beaded the sleeves red, white, and blue. I also got my Secret Spirit stuff yesterday for Jenn, since she's the name I pulled out. Not that it stayed secret for long...but I still don't know who has me so I guess it is still kind of secret. Tomorrow morning we're all going to meet in the locker room and exchange gifts. Fun fun fun. Then that night we're going to run. I'm still running the two mile race *sighs*. I always get nervous before a race. So, the last three days of the first Semester. Then most of or all of my classes will change. I will miss Creative Writing so much. That's like my favorite class. Technically, we do have homework in it, but it comes so easily to me that it doesn't feel like homework. I hope I have all the same people in my classes though. I wouldn't mind changing Government and Algebra teachers, and I'm really glad that keyboarding is only a one Semester class cause that class is really boring. Then again this also means that exams are only a few days away...FRIDAY. EEEE! At least the two classes for Friday exams will be easy...English and Keyboarding. Then over the weekend I'll hold a cram study session for all the hard classes next week. + I _____ Mallory + Mallory is _____ + If I were alone in a room with Mallory, I would _____ + I think Mallory should become a _____ + Mallory needs ______ + Someday Mallory will _____ + Mallory reminds me of _____ + Without Mallory I ______ + Memories of Mallory are ______ + Mallory can be ______ + Worst thing about Mallory is ______ + Best thing about Mallory is _______ Keniesha, you better fill this out and email me! LoL j/k. Anyone else who wants to answer this can, I don't care. LoL I just found it somewhere and put it on here randomly because I'm bored. LoL.
I went to Peter Pan with Amanda this morning. The boy to played Peter was so cute! Awww. Thimble! Other than that and talking with Aman my day has pretty much really sucked. I got into another fight with my parents, which is typical but this time it was over something so stupid I can't even stand myself for it. GAH!!!!!!! I need a hug! *whimpers* Anyway, I talked to Kevin for a while today. Like, an hour. That was hilarious. I'm not telling you what we talked about, because it was mostly just random crap but...it was funny! Then he invited me to chat and to my horror Corey was in there! He told me to leave and I told him to leave, and all in all it was pretty funny. Hmmm. I spent a lot of time with my guitar on today. I was going insane with boredom, Keniesha was never online and Kendra disappeared on me. I wanted to sleep but I couldn't, no matter how much sleep I've lost over just this week. I wanted to work on my Creative Writing final story, but I was stuck on this one part where Beethoven first starts going deaf. So, I just hung out in my room doing nothing but playing on my guitar. So today I didn't accomplish much at all. Nope. Tomorrow for Sunday School we're going for three hours from 5:30 to 8:30, because we're feeding the homeless people that are staying at our Parish. Eddie was talking about it in Government, and Melissa was all, "But I'm afraid of homeless people!" LoL. She is so goofy sometimes. Then on Monday I have the Puffy Paint Party. Fun. Then on Tuesday I'm going to die at the County Meet. I need support, so everyone pray for me Tuesday night and say out loud, "GO MALLORY" no matter where you are. Thank you, it is much appreciated. LoL. I think I'll go back to being bored again. Actually, I'm talking to Sarah so it's not so bad.

I have Tae Kwon Do in about five minutes. I don't want to go because I'm talking to Rabbit about something VERY INTERESTING. That's it....I'm stupid. Keniesha you Rock!!!!!!!!!
Music News A lot of things going today and lately in music. (Okay, you got me, I'm just posting because I'm bored and taking a break between writing posts and typing my Creative Writing story). Anyway, loads of things going on! Some things very cool, and some things very uncool. 1. We all know (or now you do) that the former Evanescence guitarist and front man Ben Moody left the band a few months ago. I just found out that he has agreed to offer his talents to none other than Avril Lavigne's upcoming album. That's sinking pretty low, if you ask me. But also for Evanescence, Amy Lee has got the guitarist from Cold to step in for Moody, and they are also working on their new album, due out sometime this year. Whoot. 2. I listened to Coldplay a lot today. I stole Shelby's "A Rush of Blood to the Head" CD. Very cool. Especially "Scientist". They have such raw passion and emotion, it's so awesome. I wish I had their CD, but I can just steal Shelby's. 3. Whenever I haven't been listening to Coldplay I've been listening to Maroon 5. I love their style, it's very refreshing. It's kind of racy, one or two cuss words and sexual connotations, but it honestly isn't that bad for that. I love it. Especially "Harder to Breathe" and "She Will Be Loved". Very awesome. Very. 4. I started getting through some favorite songs by ear today, my guitar is stretching out of tune from all the string bending I’m doing. It’s very good practice though, and it is very time-consuming, yet fun. I played “Another Brick in the Wall Part Two” for my father the other day; he was very proud and thought it was pretty cool since Pink Floyd was and apparently is his favorite band. Cool. 5. I’ve noticed lately that there aren’t a lot of girl guitarists in the media. Sure, there’s Liz Phair and the Donnas, and that band Lillix (I dare not count Ms. Lavigne, since she knows all of maybe three chords max). But really, not a lot of hardcore, frontwomen playing guitar and rocking out. Sheryl Crow, sorry, forgot her for a second there. Not a lot. Hopefully I’ll help change that someday. Errr….not much else.
Okay, so I didn’t get any snow. Like, a dusting, where you couldn’t even see the snow except for the cracks in the sidewalk. So, I woke up this morning at 5:30 and took my shower, got ready, and left the house to get Mandy by 6:30. It was, oh, say about ten degrees Fahrenheit, and we were waiting for the bus. Then it gets to be almost seven and we start wondering where the bus is. That’s when my ears started losing the feeling. Then, it’s almost 7:05 and we haven’t seen any buses at all. Classes start at 7:17 so we start thinking we won’t make it at all in time. Nikki’s mom called the school then and told them, but they said they hadn’t had a report of a broken-down bus. Then it got to be 7:15 and people start leaving the bus stop, since they’re all freezing. At that point I couldn’t feel my ears at all and my feet were starting to tingle. Nikki’s mom calls the school two more times and they finally report that our bus driver simply ‘skipped’ a few stops! It was almost 7:30 and we all went home! So I have an excused absence from school (it shouldn’t really be an absence at all since it’s not my fault!) and I have the whole day to myself. It was so freaky. We were making jokes about it! Well, I was making jokes about it. “This is like the Twilight Zone!” or, “This is like Titanic while they’re waiting for the boats! Jack! Don’t leave me Jack!” So now I’m home, and I can catch up on my Creative Writing project and all my posts on the BD. Cool! Free day! Guess I didn’t need a snow day!
DAMNIT!!!!! Excuse the language, I just lost a really long long entry that I...eeeeeeerrrrrrrg! In short, this week has been SO INCREDIBLY AWESOME. All my friends. I just wanted to say that this year has really taught me true friendship and even if I don't know someone that well it's really great and uplifting just to have a lot of people walk by you and say "Hey, Mallory" or acknowledge you in some way. Kendra, Keniesha, Amanda, Amanda#2, Sarah "Hopper", Andy, Jenny, Jenn, Sarah "SARS", Alex, Kevin, Ryan, Catie, Joey, JessJo, and EVERYONE ELSE: YOU ARE THE COOLEST! Also, at the meet on Tuesday I did way better, I had some Personal Records: Last week: Overall Time for 2-Mile: 14:57 Split/Mile Time for 2-Mile: 7:13 This week: Overall: 14:23 Split/Mile: 6:56!!! I'm so happy. I also applied for the Naval Academy and their Cross-Country distance camp. I also brought up my Algebra scores. YAY! Now if only God would keep granting me awesome days and give me a snow day tomorrow...
17-17 in overtime, Packers v. Eagles in the playoff games, Eagles win the toss. Somehow Green Bay gets back the ball and then Brett Favre, the veteran quarterback that led Green Bay so far, sends an interception right to the Eagles, the ball flying blindly out of his hands. Inevitably, the Eagles win 20-17 with a field goal kick and the Packers get picked off in the playoffs for the second year in a row. Disappointing. Well, Mr. Jim, I wish your team luck and hopefully the Eagles get as far as they want this year. Brett, sorry 'bout your Father, I can empathize in a way, but I hope that kind of throw never, never, NEVER happens again. Probably my final commentary on Packer's football and football in general until next year. I finished my Lord of the Flies report on Simon. Wonderful, if I do say so myself, I mean, for only taking a few hours...
I spent my whole Saturday at the Armory Meet. I didn't have to be there, but I was an alternate for the 3200 Relay and Kendra didn't want to be the only person there to help write down the times of our teams and other teams. So I got up at 6AM and went to school, ready with my blanket and pillow for the long ride to the Baltimore Armory. It was, oh, about 8 degrees Fahrenheit (sp?) outside, and we got a damn cheese-bus (a regular school bus, not a nice coach bus)!!! Anyway, the ride was about a half hour long, and when we got there we all got off the cheese and walked a few blocks to the entrance of the Armory, to be greeted by Army dudes with guns strapped to their hips and slung about their chests. Then we went in and found a little spot by the corner near the barracks area. There were thirty other schools there, some from MD, some not. But it was cool, all in all. It hurt my butt sitting on the hard ground taking down times, but I guess I'm kind of glad we went. The girls were close to getting a few medals, but they always got fourth place (when you needed third to get a medal) by a few tenths of a second. The guys, overall, got first place, and got a big bowl for a trophy. In any case, after Coach Ward put barbeque chips in the bowl on the bus, Littlejohn somehow broke the bowl from its stand and Coach Limaata wore the bowl upside-down as a hat. That's basically my weekend. In other news, I wrote up a bio for another RPG (one that I was invited to join, and gladly accepted the offer) and 'unofficially' I am going to join forces (*evil laugh*) with an awesome writer with whom I've already had the pleasure to game, and all is well with the world...except that I have a four-page report due on the character Simon from "Lord of the Flies" including the analogy between him and Christ as saviors for the evils of mankind...something to that extent. Due tomorrow. And it's four-thirty in the afternoon...
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! I ran the two-mile race today during the track meet!! I PLACED FIFTH OUT OF FIFTEEN!!! I was so scared of being last, but I got fifth!

LoL, Britney Spears got married for a total of two or three days (not sure how long) and it was only annulled yesterday. That's so hilarious. *grins* 1) What's on your bedside table? Alarm clock, CDs, sheet music, guitar picks. 2) What's the geekiest part of your music collection? Teehee, I'd have to say my, "Beethoven's Last Night" CD, a refreshing mixture of Rock and classical music written and produced by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. 3) What do you eat when you raid the fridge at night? Um....Cheese. Cheddar Cheese. 4) What is your secret "guaranteed weeping" film? Haven't found it yet. I don't really cry in movies. 5) If you could have plastic surgery, what would you have done? I've already had three plastic surgeries (minor ones) on my birthmark, a cavernous hemangioma on my bottom left lip. While a whole lot smaller than when I was six, the damn thing is still there and I want it gone. That's the only way I'd ever get plastic surgery done again. 6) Do you have a completely irrational fear? If so, of what? FAILURE. DISAPPOINTING OTHERS. 7) What is the little physical habit that gives away your insecure moments? Tapping my nails on any hard surface or drumming with my feet. 8) Do you ever have to beg? Errr, nope. 9) Do you have too many love interests? I don't think so... 10) Do you know anyone famous? Nope. 11) Describe your bed. Twin-size bed, a little raised off the ground because it used to be a bunk bed before we decided to cut it down (since I kept hitting my head on it!) with a flower-patterned blue, green, orange, and red sheets/comforter. BORING. 12) Spontaneous or plan? Spontaneous. 13) Who should play you in a movie about your life? Eliza Dushku. 14) Do you know how to play poker?

I prefer drawing. 16) How do you drive? Hah! I don't even get my PERMIT until March 5th, 2005. 17) What do you miss most about being little? Being carefree and not having to worry about the past nor present. Besides, recess was a plus, as was naptime. 18) Are you happy with your given name? I'm okay with it. If I were me, I'd have gone with a different one, but eh. Dem's parents. Mallory also means Bad Luck and Army Counselor, but...oh well. Does it matter? 19) What was the last song you were listening to? "My Last Breath" Evanescence. 20) Have you ever been in a school play? Annie...in fifth grade.

Nope. 24) Do you think you're cute? Do not utter that word EVER in my presence. *growls* 25) Do you consider yourself to be a nice person? Mostly, unless sufficiently peeved, and then I can hold grudges for years. *grins* MEET TOMORROW! AHHHH KATE'S GONNA SMOKE ME IN THE 2MILE!!!
Hmmmm back to school again. In Creative Writing we're doing our final project, which will be our choice so long as it involves the written word. I sent in my proposal for a music-based short story, and I had something planned but then I tried explaining it to a friend and I realized how stupid it sounded. Really typical, like something with graduated High Schoolers and a touch of the movie, "A Walk to Remember." Of course I would have given it my own flare, but now I just don't like the idea anymore. Spanish was okay. We started a food unit and hopefully we'll get to eat some actual food. The movie we watched was kind of disgusting, with them gutting fish and whipping themselves at Passover down there in Mexico. But I kind of liked the movie, only because we are going to have a test on it and the movie was in English (=easy notes). Algrebra sucked, as usual. We split up into new groups, which also sucked because I liked my old seat in front of Cory and next to Amanda and behind the dude with the big head. Then we did a ton of dittos on linear equations...which was totally and completely boring. Grrrr. Guitar was same old same old. Not good, not bad. I got a hug from Kevin, so it made me feel a little better. Track was okay. Got a meet this Wednesday. Whooo (*lack of enthusiasm*).
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!! GREEN BAY WON THE WILDCARD GAME AGAINST THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS!!!! WHOOT WHOOT! THEY'RE GOING ON TO PHILLY BABY!!!! GONNA WIN THE SUPERBOWL!!!!! *breathes* Return pass! Interception! Hassleback (sp?) threw the ball in overtime, Al Harris intercepts and runs back to the Packer line! 33-27 baby! Gonna wear my packer gear tonight! Gonna bring my packer keychain to school tomorrow, gonna be proud of my boys from Green Bay! Whoot to the Mid-west! Oh, and guess what else is good? THE RAVENS LOST! Hah! Yeah, just about everyone in my state was rooting for them to win, but, HA! I'm so glad! I never thought I'd be so into football...
2004! So far, so good. *HUGS* TOTAL! urlLink give guitargurlie more *HUGS* urlLink Get hugs of your own Hugs? Anyone? Tonight we're going out to dinner for mommy's birthday. Fun. She unwrapped all her gifts. We (Shelby and I) gave her stuff from Bath and Body Works. Not quite personal in any way, IMHO, but she loved them and that's all that matters. Argh, it's finally hitting me that school starts Monday and Exams are at the end of the month. We have such a messed up schedule for exams. Well, not really, but I hate exams so I'm just going to diss them anyway. Here's the schedule: Friday, January 23 7:17 – 7:30 Pd 1 – Attendance and Announcements 7:35 – 9:35 Period 1 A Day Exam 9:40 – 9:50 Break 9:50 – 11:50 Period 2 A Day Exam 11:50 – 11:55 Announcements Monday, January 26 7:17 – 7:30 Pd 1 – Attendance and Announcements 7:35 – 9:35 Period 3 A Day Exam 9:40 – 9:50 Break 9:50 – 11:50 Period 4 A Day Exam 11:50 – 11:55 Announcements Tuesday, January 27 7:17 – 7:30 Pd 1 – Attendance and Announcements 7:35 – 9:35 Period 1 B Day Exam 9:40 – 9:50 Break 9:50 – 11:50 Period 2 B Day Exam 11:50 – 11:55 Announcements Wednesday, January 28 7:17 – 7:30 Pd 1 – Attendance and Announcements 7:35 – 9:35 Period 3 B Day Exam 9:40 – 9:50 Break 9:50 – 11:50 Period 4 B Day Exam 11:50 – 11:55 Announcements Yep. Then we get Thursday and Friday off to wallow in our self-pity, and convince ourselves to think the worst (that we failed) and hope for the best (that we pass and get the credit). At least on those days we're getting out two hours early! I hope we don't have track practice those days too, but we probably do since the Regionals and States are two and three weeks after the tests. I dunno. Anyway, give me hugs! I hope all the rest of you High School and College students do well on your Mid-Term exams! Good luck! Oh, right. HAPPY NEW YEAR!
Wow, a lot has happened... Thursday and Friday were boring, really. Actually, they might not have been boring, I just don't remember what happened. But Friday afternoon I went home on the bus and started packing for the 30-Hour Famine. It's this progect that my church and lots of other churches do the last weekend in February. We go to church, kind of like a lock-in almost, and do things to help the people in Africa and other third-world countries (even the US, I've learned) who are having serious problems with starving people. In any case, I went to guitar practice and then we went to pick up Kendra, who was to be my guest on this starve-fest. So, now the story of the Thirty-Hour Famine, all set in my Church! We brought donations and pledges, and we earned enough money to feed six children, each for two years. Or, similarly, twelve children for a year. You know, fifty cents feeds a single child for a day? But we went to church, and there were other kids that came to stay from Saint Andrew's By the Bay, Mount Saint Joe's High School, Our Lady of the Fields, Holy Trinity, and there were ten or so kids from our church. We had loads of fun! For not eating for thirty hours, we had soooooo much fun! A band came and played while a few of us made posters with pictures from magazines of children, adding some of the facts and figures about starvation. That was fun. We played ice-breaker games so we could get to know the kids from other churches. Kendra, Lindsay, Robert, and I made one-hundred Easter Cards for the homeless children of a near-by shelter. Then it started to get late so we were allowed to watch Bruce Almighty or just hang out for a while. Most of us didn't get too sleepy until we all about passed out at say....one oclock in the morning. Saturday morning started early. We woke up at eight and started right out with a big prayer. Then we played a game where some of us sat on the floor, some of us sat in chairs with a little brown table, and some of us sat at a beautiful white-clothed table with silverware. The people at the pretty table represented 15% of the world, the part that has no trouble getting food on the table or keeping their family well-fed and clothed. The people at the brown table with the chairs represented 30% of the world, the percentage tht has maybe a little struggle, but everyone is content in their family and gets enough to eat to keep them healthy. They are the people who are flirting with the line of poverty. The people who sat on the floor (Kendra and I got to sit in this section, LoL) represented 55% of the world, the part that is in complete poverty and rarely has enough, if anything, to eat. We read stories about people in poverty from Haiti, Sudan, Egypt, Cambodia, and Bangladesh. Then we made SANDWICHES! They were reallllllly icky-looking, which is why I hesitate to mention that they actually started to smell like McDonalds. Yes, that's how hungry I was. LoL. They were bologna, cheese, and mustard sandwiches. We made them and wrapped them in something like an assembly line. We made over 600 sandwiches for homeless and poorer people in our County. It was really awesome. Then we walked around the neighborhood that is next to my church, collecting canned goods that had been set out by the nice people living there. It was really awesome, and people said they really thought we were wonderful young people for doing all the things we were doing during the Famine. After that we went back to church and met a man who'd been to Haiti with our Sister Parish for a week. He showed us some really cool stuff. It was awesome. We then wrote letters to our Senators and District Representatives, telling them our story and asking for their help to expand the money in the 2005 budget for Food Programs. We ended with a large prayer. Gail sent around a roll of thread, that faded from one color of the rainbow into another. She asked us to either say a hope/prayer aloud, or say it to ourselves, then wrap some of the thread around our wrists and pass it on. So, when it got back to Gail on the other side of the circle, she said one long prayer with us. When we were done she came around and snipped the threads, and told us to have the person to our left tie our piece of string around our wrist. She said it would help to remind us of what we did to help, and how we could use the things we learned to help others. Then Gail read a passage from the Bible, and I don't recall where exactly it is (I wish I knew the Bible better) but it's when Jesus washes his Disciples' feet. She had two bowls put in the middle of the circle, and we were to wash someone else's hands from the opposite side of the circle, and they were to wash our own. Gail said it was important to learn not only to serve others, but to let ourselves be served as well. We all went to 5:30 mass with each other, and then we had a Pot Luck dinner to Break the Fast. It was wonderful!
Changed the template. Decided to go for the plain look. Worked out well, ne? Anyway, today was sooooooooooo much fun! We had a three hour early dismissal. Do you know what that means? Yeah, that means I got out of school today at 10:55! It was so awesome. The schedule was a bit screwed up, because it went First Period, Second, Fourth, then Third. All the classes were 25 minutes long except for Third, since everyone needed to eat lunch so it was ninety minutes or something like that. My dad drove Manda and me to school, because I had my double helix project, made out of Starbursts and Dots. I made it entirely out of candy (except for the coat hanger...) so that if I get a bad grade I can make myself feel better by eating it. Anyway, we got to school and I meet up with Amanda, who's in the main lobby. We go to the science hall together so I can drop off my project, but Mrs. Smith isn't in her room. So I say bye to Amanda and go to the North Hallway and stand with Jenny, Kendra, Andy, Kevin, and Katie until the bell rings. In Theatre Arts we did a pretty cool warm up. It's like those sentence stories where the starting person starts a story and then points to another person to finish the story. But the thing was that if you say, "Ummm," or pause for more than a second or two, you had to die. And I mean, literally pretend to die. Loud noises, coughing, dramatic falling, the works. It was funny...Then we worked in our Pantomime groups and Jenn was being excessively hyper as always. We have to perform next Wednesday, and we still haven't chosen what to do. Jenn thinks we should just do improv. +roll eyes+ Then I walked with Ryan to Spanish, and found out that I have a report due on March 1st for Mr. Bright from Matt. The thing is, I just know I have it but I don't know what to write it about, because Matt forgot. In Spanish I think we played a game...I can't remember. It all went so fast. Actually, I think I recall taking a notebook quiz or something like that. So then I went to Bio since it was 1,2,4,3 and Bio is usually my fourth period. I turned in my project and we went over the test before playing a game. Casey is such a goofball! And he cut his hair again! He was yelling at Sean for some reason too....But Biology was really boring today so I guess I'll just fastforward to Math... Math was boring too. But I actually got all the work (understood it) and finished it all really quick. Alex sat next to me and Nick worked with Colleen and Alayna. Alayna and I complained a lot about the creepy pedophile/child molester that watches us when we are at Carpentry for CATN, and everyone thought it was pretty funny. The scary part was that we were actually one hundred percent serious. Scary Mr. Kovaks.... At lunch I sat with Nora, Pepe (Brianna), Heather, Alex B. and Ali. It was funnnnnny. It only took me five minutes to get my lunch for once! Yay! When lunch ended there was a fight in the hallway that I was walking through, and like everyone was running over the lunch tables in herds to see the fight. I never actually saw it because of the millions of people crowding around it. It was funny! Then I walked with Ryan until he went to lunch and I went back to math. Then school ended. Oh! Track starts up again next Monday! Hurray! But then on Tuesday we have the Primary elections and no school. Grrrrr. Oh well. Today is Ash Wednesday and I was asked to read a passage during the 4 oclock mass. Then I get a cross put on my forehead with ashes. Then I have to go to TKD with ashes on my forehead and everyone will ask me if I fell in the dirt or something. It will probably wipe off by itself though when we start the class.
Good day. Yes. I had a test for TKD. It was boring, to be honest. There were so many little kids to direct. One first-timer, but he was okay. It was the little five-year olds that annoyed me the most. It was okay though. Joseph and Daniel got their black belt. Congratulations to them. Yay. I got my 7th Gup. It's all good. I was hungry though when it was over!! Starving, actually... So I went to see a movie today with Amanda after that. It was fun. Then next weekend I'm going with my buddies maybe to the mall or something. Something. Hey Amanda maybe I should call Chris lol (that dude I showed you after school on Friday). Not that I know his number. He asked me to call him but he has my cell number and I don't have his. Yeah, Sarah gave him it. LoL. That was funny with Josh and Nicole...*laughs* Hah! Another fight with Paula. It was funny. She seems kind of obsessed with me writing about her. And apparently I'm on her buddy list in the 'hate' section. I'm happy to hear she let my screen name take up a spot just because I happen to be one of the people she hates. It's almost funny. I don't even know why we hate each other. It's kind of funny though. Admittedly I used to be to self-consious to ever say something about my dislike for her at all, but now I really could care less. Whatever. I'm over it. She can say that we used to be friends like three years ago, but now that I have real friends I could never call whatever it was a friendship. So that's it. Anyway. Long conversations with Kendra and Keniesha. We're going to hang out more when outdoor starts. NecromancerJulin: yo guitargurlie89: hey NecromancerJulin: yo guitargurlie89: hey NecromancerJulin: yo you are a chicken guitargurlie89: what?? NecromancerJulin: a chicken gobble NecromancerJulin: wait that a turkey lol NecromancerJulin: haha NecromancerJulin: hmm guitargurlie89: you are so confusing. guitargurlie89: :-D NecromancerJulin: really? guitargurlie89: sometimes NecromancerJulin: most of the time I'm a chicken, but a brave chicken if I do say so myself. Anyway, heading to the mall on Saturday, as plans have been made now unofficially. Maybe I could hang out either with Amanda or Johnen on Sunday next week. I'm booking up my schedule for no real reason. For things to do I guess. Life gets dull. Life gets boring. Also, this woman walked into the store on Friday, with a little acoustic guitar in her hands. She set it on the counter and pulled her coat closer to her. Then she asked if we fixed strings and did tuning. I said yes. She laughed, saying that it (the guitar) had just been lying around in the back of her car for about six months. My eyes widened. "You know, leaving your guitar in the cold overnight and for a few months without a case is probably almost as bad as when rock stars smash them at the end of their concerts..." she laughed at me again and just proceeded to give her name and number for when she could come back and pick up her guitar. I felt sorry for the inanimate object. That's a first...So I gave it to Johnen and he took it to the back. Coach Keith's wife teaches vocals and piano upstairs, so I saw him twice. It's almost scaring me out of showing up. LoL. Awwww I've been so tired lately. May as well go get some sleep... Good luck to Kevin. Hope you make Varsity!
*Glomp* Today was boring. Blah... At CATN Alayna and I made holes in our wall. Yes, we took out our frustrations and smashed holes into our lovely sheet rock. Then we had a fire drill and went outside. It was actually kind of nice outside. Other than that we didn't do much. We are going to plaster our walls next class. We were almost late for the bus but it was all good. In gym I ditched my Team Sports class and went to play basketball with Daniel, Matt, Brian, Courtney, Katie, Sarah, and this other senior dude that I don't really know. It was fun. Katie told me to knee Matt in the balls, but it didn't work very well and my elbow ended up hitting his face and his foot ended up tripping him and me. It was funny though. Good stuff. Shanika and I talked about the new season, it was cool. Mr. Bright is such an idiot. Grrr I can't stand him. Gary is such a goofball though, it was almost funny when he asked Mr. Bright how old he was and if it was his brithday. Long story. I gave Courtney the moola for the Quebec trip. It's gonna be so much fun even if I don't speak French. French may be a pretty language but it's not very practical anyway with all those extra consonents. Whatever. But anyway, the Quebec trip will be fun. Lunch was boring. But I saw Kendra and she randomly told me that Ryan was sleepy. *shrug* English was boring too. I got to grab Andrew's curly hair (FRO BOY!) and yell at Josh, and our subsitute was a really annoying woman named Ms. Leech. How ironic... So then we go outside (Amanda and I) and I say good bye to Chris (and show Amanda my boyfriend! LoL) and Nicole O. walks by, Josh right behind her before he stops to say bye to us. Then he asks Nicole if she is ignoring us on purpose. So she turns around and says, "Amanda doesn't like me anymore." Hah. My cue. I just can't seem to keep my mouth shut. "She never liked you in the first place." Whoa, how did that slip out? No idea. So she blushes and walks away and Amanda and Josh burst out laughing. Then I got on bus #10 and talked to Ryan for a second (wrong bus, teehee) and got back on my bus. So today was rather uneventful. I'm going to the movies tomorrow and then on Sunday I might go with Joey to the competition. Might be worth going to. Then I have Sunday School. Blech. Ah well. "The only thing to fear...is the third lap of the 800."
Today was funny. Fun. Cool. Not bad... We turned in our Course Selection Sheets and got our report cards. I did pretty well, but Algebra grades were disappointing to I'm going to try to do better this semester in that class. I got straight A's (As in, for first marking period, second marking period, the Exams, and the final grade) across the board in Biology, English, Guitar, and Creative Writing. I got mixed A's and B's in Keyboarding and Spanish II, and a C or two mixed with A's in Algebra. The thing that dragged me down was the D on the Government exams. Everyone else is complaining to the school. Everyone got Ds and Es, and if they were extremely lucky they got a C. So Mr. Bright might be teaching us, but he's not teaching us to prepare us for the exams. In any case, I've got a 3.5 so I'm happy enough. I'll do better this semester. Nick Womack and Robin ate Kendra for lunch today. There was a serious oven problem in the cafeteria today...chicken nuggets and turkey...not really... Awww Bio was soo much fun today. Casey is such a goof. He is so funny. He got his hair cut and everyone felt bad for his cut off hair. I mean, Casey's hair is like his main asset. He's good at flipping it around LoL. Sarah and Jenny and I made a model of Protein Synthesis, which was kind of boring but Mrs. Smith is always boring. Then the bell rang and I went outside to go to my bus and it was so warm out! It was so nice. I can't wait for spring to really be here! So I was walking to the bus and I see Chris from track. He stopped to say hi to me and I asked him if he was okay because he looked sad (awww). Chris laughed and said it was because he hadn't seen me since the meet. I told him he was full of BS and he said he was serious. Then he asked me out for the millionth time before he got on his bus and told me to call him. *roll eyes* Meh. I get to see Johnen tonight at practice. I need to find out my breaking technique for this Saturday. Then after the test Amanda and I are going to go see a movie, hang out around Arundel. I don't like Arundel because it's so crowded, but the theatre is the best so I can't complain too much. Blue feet...
Joey is the coolest guy in the world. He's the greatest. Awesome. Sparring was easy. We let two people on the elite team that I don't think should have been let in, but it's not just my decision so... Report Cards tomorrow! I'm not going to be disappointed, that's all I'll say...
Eeee a lot has happened. Last night was the State Meet! I mostly hung out with Jenn, Shantel, Durke, and Chris for no real reason. Mr. Al was there, it was hilarious. Anyway, the guys got second, and there were only eleven boys that ran. They each ran more than once, sometimes four times. Kyle got a PR, and Chris Bryant got really far on the Pole Vault. We only lost by about twenty points, but Kyle says we'll just beat Suitland in outdoor. So now I have a break until March 1st. Yay! But then Kendra and Jenn and Keniesha will be back for outdoor, and all will be well. Amanda that was hilarious! Paula read my blog and got pissed, telling me to "get over it". It was so funny because honestly I'm glad we're not friends anymore. I think the only reason we were ever friends was because our parents knew each other. We were good friends in second grade, but it was all downhill from there. There are others I hate more than Paula. Sometimes I wish I was still friends with Alex, but it's not like we're fighting or anything. We've known each other for too long (almost 12 years!) for us to really hate each other. Well, she can hate me, but I don't hate her. Anyway...Then Paula logged off before I could tell her that I would write what I want and she should get over it. Funny. Heather I know you want to get out the scissors but we need to wait until Graduation day! Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... Today was rather uneventful though. I slept in late this morning, and got a ride to school with Tim. Yay. Then in Carpentry we went to a presentation so we could decide what class to take next four weeks. Alayna and I were in the slide show, pounding nails into the dry wall. But let me tell you, never operate with power tools when you're not fully awake... Nothing else really happened. I'm taking two AP classes next year, since I also am being forced to take Health. So I'm going with Honors English and Honors Chemistry, above-average World Civ. and Geometry, Spanish III, Latin I, AP Music Theory (yay!), AP Music History (maybe?), Health, and either Journalism or Lit. Mag. Sound boring? Yeah, thought so... Talked to Johnen again today. And Amanda. And Keniesha. And...well, I talked today a lot. I'm going to the movies with Johnen this weekend maybe, and on Saturday I think I might go with Amanda to a movie. MOVIES MOVIES!!!! Okay, off to see Joseph and Colin!
The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time. ~Mark Twain Because I could not stop for Death, He kindly stopped for me. The Carriage held but just ourselves And Immortality ~Emily Dickinson All these things are now before me, Endless death or timeless glory. On this night of ghosts returning To the light of bridges burning! Final Dream Lay your head down And sleep on my shoulder Lay your head down Just start a new dream And for tonight The moment is over Drift in a lullaby Here where the stars reside And angels are always seen So lay your head down The stars they have whispered Hear what they say And know what it means The moon is her guide The stars, they have kissed her As she goes gently by Light as a baby's sigh Safe on a fairy tale stream And start a new dream... I recently found out that some of the people I know well have lost a friend that was very close to them. My heart goes out to them and her family, because even though I don't know her, it seems she has touched so many lives in only fourteen years. Besides, the motto of the United States Holocaust museum says that for both the living and dead we must bear witness. When my grandfather died, I was heartbroken because I'd never experienced a death so close to me. After a while, though, at his funeral and after even that, the waves of his life were still affecting people. So, since all I've heard about this person is good, hopefully it will make the world just a little better even with the memory of her. Since the time when Ra and Isis Raised the sphinx out of the sand And Apollo dreamed Athena So men began to understand That when darkness folds on darkness In the resltess tides of night And lightning raises shadows Just for moments giving them life It's been said by those who ponder That it surely is a sign That a life touched by the stars Has now ran out of time And that somewhere in that darkness In the heart of that great storm The world returns a soul That God caused to be born...
Eeeeeee! I actually got some stuff done today. But I talked to Johnen! Yay! Yay! I'm so happy and cheerful! Teeheeeeee. It's so weird. Happyhappyhappyhappyhappyhappyhappy. Makes me wanna jump up and say hi for no reason whatsoever and to no one in particular. Happyhappy!!!!!!!!!
I am the number 1 I am the loneliest number _
Ahh, a lot has happened. Whoot... I had my first A-day classes with the new schedule on Tuesday. First period was Theatre Arts. It was kind of cool, it's right by the gym and Jenn and I have the class together. It involves a lot more work than I thought it would, though, and my teacher is kind of psycho-happy. And Becca's in that class...Then again, at least that one girl from church is in that class, and Jenn and Alix. So is Daniel. Yeah... Then I have SPANISH! It is so incredibly awesome with Señorita, she's so cool. She's loud and hyper and talks really reall fast, and even faster when she's speaking in Spanish, but she's so cool! We get to eat and drink whatever we want as long as it's not Sunflower seeds. Don't ask...long story. Matt and Matt are in that class, and so are some other people I know but don't really talk to for less obvious reasons... Then I have Algebra. It's okay, Coach is really cool as a teacher. Makes Algebra fun...ALMOST. And Paula's in that class *cringe*. It's not so bad, except she glares at me sometimes and looks at me as if I had stolen something from her. Oh well...it doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would. So long as she doesn't speak to me...Also...Alex and Colleen and Robin and other people are in there too. Alayna, my carpentry partner. It's fun...usually. Lunch is cool. Heather's in that lunch. Other people, too....like Kevin! Awwww, and hmmm, I think Catie and P-Berry are in that lunch. Bio is awesome too! Kacey is in there, so is Jenny and Ali...Marcus and DJ. Our teacher is kind of spazzy but it's all good. OUR BOYS WON REGIONALS! GOING OFF TO STATES ON TUESDAY BABY! Yeah! We also got five girls into the state championships. Our 4*2 team and Lauren. We have a guy or a team in every single event there is except for the high jump. We are winning states...putting a banner up on that wall for the first time in ten years. Awesome. I ran the two-mile. My end time kind of sucked but my split/mile time was pretty good...Six minutes, fifteen seconds. I was six seconds behind Kate. I guess I went out too fast though! Teehee. Not much else going on...we started choosing classes. I'm taking AP English, AP European History, Chemistry, Geometry, Latin I, Spanish III, AP Music Theory, Journalism, Guitar III, and they're forcing me to take health as a sophomore. Sounds good, ne? Sounds fun. I signed up for as many AP classes as I could handle! English and Music Theory will be really easy, since I've been passing my two English courses now with 100%s and well, music is music to me. I don't know about AP Eurp. History, but I'll figure it out sooner or later. Latin will be fun...Kendra and Kenny are signing up for that too, hopefully I'll be in classes with them. My room is a mess...
99% Of The Internet Loves Me! I am loved by 99% of the population, including: 811 people who love midwest people 1621 people who love happy people 1121 people who love bloggers In return, I love 56% of the population, including: 510 people with lots of shoes 653 people talking on cellular phones 143 linux users urlLink show the love at spacefem.com Oh, I feel so loved... Anyway, today was Monday. Monday sucks. I had my first Carpentry class today with Mr. Bury. He's kind of a geeky guy who's really timid. There were only nine of us...he gave each of us a piece of dry wall and a glomp of spakel (sp?) and we drew with the spakel stuff. It was fun. In gym we played basketball and soccer. It was loads of fun but only because Sarah's class was allowed to come over into Team Sports. How come I made it into Team Sports but Sarah didn't? She signed up for it and all. Whatever. Hmmm.... Government sucked arse today. I'm not even joking either. Out of six classes, only one person got an A on his Final. Only five people got Bs or Cs. Yeah, that means that 90% of us got Ds and Es. And I was one of them! I got a D! I was upset, I wanted at least a C because I have an A in the class. So I wanted a C or higher on the test because I would at least get a B in the class then, but now, how does that D on the test weigh out my A? I was upset but honestly I wasn't that surprised. In English we talked about sonnets again. We read the famous Sonnet 18, "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" Then we read a sonnet about a gay love slave...Shakespeare was a strange, strange man, even though he was brilliant. I got to talk to Amanda and Coooory. Finally tomorrow I get to go to A-day. I have theatre arts and Spanish, but that's all I'm looking forward to. Nick and Cory are in my Algebra class, so that's good, but there are some not-so-good people in that class too. People who hate me, and I hate them, so we're all one big happy hate-fest. I don't even know why we hate each other. Some people are just really prissy and bitchy sometimes. Anyway, at least Amanda said she was in that class, and hopefully Andy, Brad, Ryan, and Jenny will be in there too because I haven't seen them lately. Tomorrow is the last Indoor meet! Whoop! I'm running the two-mile. It's at the armory though, and I haven't run there yet. Full of army dudes, and I'm a navy brat. Teehee. Lalalalala. I'm going to go write a sonnet for homework....funfunfunfunfunfun....
urlLink Take the test , by urlLink Emily . Awesome. Beethoven rocks. Such a sad, intense story, very moving since he composed even though he was completely deaf... urlLink Take the test , by urlLink Emily . Errr.... Anyway, I played scrabble today! Go me. I also sent in a proposal, which was eight pages long in a Word Document! I went to Target for supplies for the new semester. So, I'm all set. Tomorrow I have to go to 12:15 mass because Sunday School is right after that for some unknown reason. Other than that I've got nothing going on. Johnen called, but not much else happened. My life is so boring.
Hah! I woke up this morning at five AM to get ready for school and my mom said it was a delay. So I made myself pancakes (real ones, not microwavable ones) and my mom left for work and said that there was no school at all. So, basically, I could have slept for five or six more hours... Practice was inevitably canceled, and Tuesday is Regionals so I guess everyone is running on their own. I'm still going to run the two-mile, and hopefully the Baltimore Armory will be better than PGSLC. I'm going for a Personal Record, (PR) hopefully under 14 minutes, even though my PR is 14:23. My open 800 on Tuesday at PGSLC was really good, I was fifth (would have been fourth, if not for that darned Chesapeake girl). Shanika said outdoor was more fun, and Kate won't be participating, since she does Lacrosse. Sarah's going to do Tennis, but Jenn, Kendra, and Keniesha are all going to do outdoor with me. So I'll be the 'star' two-mile runner, since Kendra is convinced it will take her a while to get back in shape after taking the winter season off. Whatever. My goals are set. Hmmm. I went to Johnen's yesterday. Fun. That's about the only good thing that happened yesterday. The new classes sucked, and I'm fearing the worst for my Algebra class on Tuesday. I also want to ditch CATN, if only because I feel like I could be doing something more music-oriented, like Music Theory or Music Theatre. Theatre Arts just sounds stupid. So we took Jenn home yesterday after track and found out that Emily and Kyle don't live too far away. I went through the house this morning and found a plethora of guitar picks that had been lost, found, and lost again over and over in a vicious cycle. I also found my Ataris and Bowling for Soup CDs, as well as the Trans-Siberian CD that my mother had let me borrow. My Evanescence CD is scratched all over, probably from Charlotte scratching her baby claws all over it like she does everything else. Speaking of which, Charlotte is doing very well. Her ears smell like baby powder (random...) and she gets along with Sundae very well. They like to play together! General Posy misses Midnight still, and he sleeps in the kitty bed that used to belong to Middie. Oh, and a weird thing we found out was that Midnight died a year before Grandpa on the same day...Spoooooooky. But the kitties are doing well. GenGen is the only outdoor one, thank God. We don't want another run-over cat. Ahh, more bullsh!t with the President. Can't wait for reelection, even though I can't vote. My uncle is getting transferred out of Bahrain (Thank the Lord!) back to London. Mary-Beth is still in Spain for a while. Oh, and in other news, Reagan is 93. Wow. Like I care. Sometimes I can't understand how people like Mr. Bright and Reagan are still alive and perfectly wonderful people like my grandfather are dead. I'm not saying I wish that people like that were dead, I'm just saying that it's not fair. And I know, "Life's not fair" but you know what? It should be. The world sucks, it's almost depressing how horrible everything is. Outside the country, inside the country, inside the damn High Schools even! Okay, that's my rant for the day. I'm going over to Andy's house then I might go somewhere with Keniesha. Probably won't go anywhere with Rabbit though because I haven't heard from them in a while. Oh well. S'ok.
EEEeeeeeeee!!!! New Semester, new schedules, new teachers, new electives! Yippee! I miss all the buddies from my other classes terribly, but only one day has gone by so maybe they'll be in my classes tomorrow. I can only hope! Here's my new schedule: A-Day 1 - Theatre Arts 2 - Spanish III 3 - Algebra 4 - Biology B-Day (what I had today) 1 - Center of Applied Technology North, where I'm taking Carpentry for six weeks, Baking/Pastry for six weeks, and Welding for six weeks. Fun. *rolls eyes* 2 - Team Sports 3 - Government (with the same damn teacher! ERRRRRG! I hate that eighty-year old pregnant man!) 4 - English Today was a B-day. Apparently Amber and I were supposed to get right on the CATN bus and skip our schedules, but instead we went to Advisory and did get our schedules. Thus we missed the CATN bus and waited for two hours in the cafeteria. It was boring as hell. But at least I got my schedule. Then second period I had Team Sports in the Gym with Coach. There was only one other girl in my class. But P-Berry and Grumpy Gills (LoL Kendra) were in the Weight Training class that same period, Kendra and Shanika were in Aerobics the same period, and Sarah is getting her Fitness for Life that period changed to Team Sports since that's what she chose to begin with. So Yay! Damnit, I have the same old Government teacher. Yeah, the one who likes to look at girls, had a heart attack last year, and is as deaf as if he had no ears. But Sarah has that class too, so I'm okay I guess. Matt has the class too, and he was my paper boy for a few years so I kind of teased him for it but it's all good. English. I have a new teacher, and she's an obsessive-compulsive little woman who is completely wrapped up in staying organized. We talked about how Sonnets were all ABABCDCDEFEFGG, 14 lines, 10 syllables a line. It was kind of strange. Oh well. Then we took pictures for track. I should say what happened at the meet on Tuesday, but it's too embarrassing for words. It was a complete disappointment, but not because of me. Because of one of my teammates during the relay. She just kind of quit. Ran off the track, dropping the damn baton when she only had one last lap to go. Then they told us to go on! WHAT THE HELL! (Excuse the language) We were three laps behind everyone! So I was anchor, and running three laps with the track to myself because of that stupid witch who couldn't finish four laps! HALF A MILE! NOT THAT HARD! It was so frustrating. But my mile and open 800 times were good. I can't wait till outdoor.
Pick a band and then answer the questions about yourself with their lyrics. Try to answer each question with lyrics from a different song. 1. Favorite Band/Singer: Trans-Siberian Orchestra 2. Are you male or female?: Ornament There is an ornament Lost inside the night There on a Christmas tree With a thousand lights No one can see her She's standing all alone Somewhere she glistens where no one can see 3. Describe yourself: What Is Eternal And here in the night, as I feel the inferno I stare in the dark, thinking what is eternal The man or the moment? The act or the reason? These thoughts fill my head as I contemplate treason Now caught in a waltz with the eternal dancer I’m courted by death, but death isn’t the answer 4. How do you feel about other people: Then, Maybe then In this world of circumstance Children never fear forever And this moment that enchants Someday we may both remember Then, maybe then If we are still alive Then, maybe then This moment will survive There is time in every word There are words in every reason And these notes that are unheard Someday they may find their season 5. How do you feel about yourself?: The Dark Feel the darkness smiling Every note is dying Silence is refining Every thought in my heart Still the Fates are weaving Every note that’s bleeding As I sit here seething All alone in the dark Alone in the dark Someone is whispering softly to me Shadows of things that no one can see They are there for you if you want them to be You want them to be But in the night The darkness breathes If I will it to be Before my eyes The music dies But you will always hear me The only sound That I will hear Is here in my heart… 6. Describe your girlfriend/boyfriend: Time Time, only time Could ever take me away from you And why, should it try Time never cares just what we do It just sits on a star and gazes down Dropping its moments all around And if I could wish upon that star I would find what you dream and then Ask God to grant it I wanted to say this Long before this dark would fall At night I would pray this And wonder if God heard at all For the chances I’ve had are now long gone And that star is no longer wished upon For on this night it seems to far away 7. What would you rather be doing: Empty-Handed I’m packing my bags ‘Cause I don’t wanna be The only one who’s drowning In their misery And I’ll take that chance ‘Cause I just wanna breathe And I won’t look back And wonder how it’s supposed to be 8. Describe where you live: Sarajevo But as he neared the earth Of a recent battleground From among the ruins He once more heard the sound It was a single cello playing A forgotten love song And even on that battlefield The song somehow belonged And as he flew away The angel did take note That where he found the music played One could always find hope As he flew over the countryside He was still listening When from a little church below He heard one voice begin to sing 9. Describe how you love: Mephistopheles Returns Don’t need this path before me Don’t need forgotten glory Don’t need the threats of violence Don’t need eternal silence Don’t need these midnight visions Don’t need to make decisions Don’t need to be uncertain Don’t need this final curtain All these things are now before me Endless death or timeless glory On this night of ghosts returning To the light of bridges burning 10. Share a few words of wisdom: An Angel Returned An angel returned That night through the sky But time it was short He had to decide And so he flew Back over the land A gift for his Lord Was there in his hand It was the glow of a light It was the heart of a song It was the tear of a child Where they never belonged It was a wish of a soul On an old neon light And the Lord smiled at him On that cold winter night Hear as they ring through the night Kyrie among nations Kyrie among nations Hear as the bells ring through the night
AHHHH!! The meet was so awesome! It was so cool! Hehehehehe! So I get to school this morning, and go to the North end to give a nice good-morning to Kendra, Andy, Ryan, and Jenny and Hopper. Then I took my chicken breasts (LoL!) to Señorita Sharrer's room. She told me I was awesome because Matt didn't bring his chicken boobs. ;-) Then I went back downstairs and said good-morning to everyone in the locker room when I put my track stuff down there. Then it was time to go to Theatre Arts. It was a thoroughly and completely uneventful class. We recited the memories that had been randomly passed back to us, nameless. I had Tiffany's memory, which was incredibly sad and depressing. I know my memory was happy, but the gothic chick who had mine wasn't there (as usual). In Spanish I helped cook the Paella! Yay! It was so awesome! WHOA! In math we had a really freaky substitute. She was like, permanently PMSing or something, 'cause she was really, really bizzotchy. Ha! She read my name and pronounced it so wrong! She goes, "Maaaah - Lair - eee?" and I totally wondered how she got that from Mall o ry. I dunno, she was seriously weird and psycho about the test we were taking too...whoa... Biology was stupid. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! THE MEET ROCKED SO HARDCORE!!! IT WAS SO AWESOME! It was at Chesapeake, and it was us, Chesapeake, Arundel, and Northeast. Girls and boys got first place! And guess what? GUESS!!! I GOT THIRD IN THE MILE!! THIRD PLACE!!! And I got SECOND in the half-mile!!! I WAS SO HAPPY!!! I have enough points to get my varsity letter, and it's only the second meet of the season. Whoa! Hahaha! I got a Personal Record on my mile, and I think the 800 got me a PR too. YAY! SOY AMADA!!!!
Ack. So much has happened in the past two days...maybe three days...when was the last time I posted?!? I'm not sure...the post options thing for blogger is messed up. ANYWAY... On Monday...what happened! Goodness I've forgotten. It was an A-day, so yeah...I was asked to bring Chicken Boobs (Breasts, LoL) to Spanish class tomorrow so we could make Paella. In Theatre arts we played sharades! Whoa was that funny! I went up and got "Peter Pan" I was so confused because I had no idea how I would get my team to know it was Peter Pan. So when the time started I flung myself across the stage in a leaping way and waved my arms around. Spencer screams, "PETER PAN!!!" Yup. We got that one in thirteen seconds. Lol. Math was stupid. Grr. At lunch I had to hold the box thingy for Theatre Arts. So when lunch was over I walked down towards the Theatre Arts classroom, and Paula walked by and I rolled my eyes. She said something, it might have been calling me a name for rolling my eyes at her, or something to that extent. I think it's funny how it almost seems like I annoy her. I might not be annoying her, but if I am it's really funny. So I come back from dropping the box off at Ms. Parker's room and I get to see Keniesha and Ryan and...well, I saw Courtney too, but she doesn't really like me much. Yay! I got to see my homies from D lunch. Biology was boring, except I made babies. No, not like *that*. We got a partner and flipped coins for the different genotypes. I made babies with Jenny, since we had so many boys. SHE IS THE FATHER!!! Lol. We had a girl, and we named her after my sister (and the baby turned out to be really ugly so it turned out nicely), and a boy that we named Curious George. ;-) Then at track on Monday I found out that I would be going to both meets, one on Wednesday and one on Saturday, which is the Invite. Tomorrow Coach is letting me run the mile and half-mile, since she's letting me get a variety before I am being forced to run the two-mile on Saturday. --- Today was funnnnnnny. I woke up at 6:20, and my dad yelled at me for sleeping in late. I got ready in a record time of fifteen minutes! Go me! Yay! In Agriscience we made pretty-pretty flower arrangements and got to take them home. So I carried bunches of flowers all around school. Other than that, not a lot happened today other than me and Amanda patching things up. Yay for that!! She suggested doing the talent show with me, and I'd play guitar and she'd sing. YAY!!!!
I wanted you to know, That I love the way you laugh. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away... I keep your photograph, And I know it serves me well. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain -- Because I'm broken When I'm lonesome! And I don't feel right when you're gone, away... The worst is over is now, And we can breathe again! I wanna hold you high and steal thy pain, away There's so much left to learn, And no one left to find. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain. Because I'm broken, When I'm lost... And I don't feel right. Am I strong enough? 'Cause I'm broken, When I'm lonesome... And I don't feel right -- When you're gone, away... This weekend has seemed so long. I guess I should be glad, but I don't know anymore. I'm so bored. Not really bored, actually, more like aimless and unsure. I've been going through all these old documents on my computer, some of them are so old and some of them are rather embarrassing songs and stories from ages ago. I don't know. Old digital photographs, old tales of heroes and old virtues that no longer exist in the modern day. It's so funny sometimes, that I used to wish that people were like the characters in my stories and songs and poems. Oh well. Dreams are crushed sometimes, it just means you have to make new ones... Feeling: Happy and kind of surprised at all these old writings. Drinking: Water. Ha! Eating: Nada. Wishing: A certain movie song comes to mind... And even though I know how very far apart we are, It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star. And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby, It helps to think we might be sleeping underneath the same big sky! Writing: Re-writing that stupid Beethoven story. Note to self: Multiple forms of the verb "to be" are your ENEMY! Gah! Singing: Old songs from my music directory. LoL!!
For some reason, today I had the weirdest question pop into my brain. I wondered who would attend my funeral if I died today. It was so strange, but I was talking to the man who'd been to Iraq and I suddenly wondered, "Hey, if I died today, who would go to my funeral and miss me?" It's not just the man from the war...I was in the part of Little Women where Beth gets scarlet fever, and all her sisters realize how much everyone in the town loves Beth, even though they always just thought of her as their shy little sister. I know it's such a strange thought...I just wonder sometimes. I like to think that I know the names and faces flashing through my head would go, but I can't ever say for anyone. I can't speak for everyone. I definitely know that some people think I'm a bitch, and I definitely know that at least a few people would never think of me as such. I like to think some people would miss me terribly, as I would miss them, and yet some people I know would turn their backs and not think twice. It's so strange. *bangs aching head on desk* Maybe I'm just delerious. Maybe I just get memories from Grandpa's funeral last December, and seeing that he wasn't just loved by me or Dad or even his immediate family. Seeing everyone hurt for him, but everyone glad somehow that he was out of the pain caused by cancer. Isn't it strange that so many lives can be changed and rearranged by something so small? Something out of our hands causes people to have to readjust their comfort zone and their loved one's comfort zones. "To die would be an awefully big adventure." - Peter Pan Perhaps I should think of it that way. It seems so much more positive, hey? I'm not planning on dying any time soon, but who knows? Maybe I'll grow up and have to go to war, fighting for something I might not believe in, and lose and arm like Mark or lose my life. Maybe I'll grow up and have cancer, battling against something I can't see and parry the blows, dying slowly. Maybe I'll grow up and die at a ripe old age, with someone by my side loving me. Maybe I shouldn't care so long as I die loved. All this stuff is wearing me out...G'night...
Ouch. Woke up this morning at 9. Dad didn't make me go to school this morning. I'm glad, because P.E. is incredibly boring and I was sick of working with hoes in Agriscience. ;-) So at 10:20 we make the drive to Silver Spring. The roads there are terrible, I don't know why anyone would ever want to work there or live there or have to drive there unless absolute necessity called for it. It was terrible! But we eventually got to the Army Medical Center. Army...*rolls eyes* Give me Navy any day. It was so sad. I saw men there, men who'd been to Iraq. Every time I feel sorry for myself, I promise that I'll think of them and how it could always be worse. Always. That poor man lost his forearm from the elbow down. I wanted to cry for them, because I felt so bad that they had to go over to a place so far from home and make such sacrifices. Anyway...we keep going and get to the Dermatology clinic, since my surgery is technically dealing with the skin. A woman there, she was very old...apparently she'd just had a surgery and I got to push her wheelchair since we were called at the same time. She thanked me and gave me a mint from the pocket of her wheelchair. Then my doctor looked at the pictures from before all the surgeries and right after, thanked me for bringing them in, told me how much better *it* looked, and it was time for surgery. It hurt like hell. I hated myself for seeming like such a wuss, but it **hurt**. The first part, the tears just came subconsiously. The second time, I had to keep back the sobs. The third and final part, I gave up and let go of my dad's hand. It hurt really really bad. The doctor got ice though, and he talked to my dad for a while in another room and I got to look at his office. He had all these pictures of his five daughters and of his awards for medical schooling and stuff like that. Then it was time to go home. It was all over. It's swollen, but the discoloration is gone immediately. Cavernous hemangioma leaves scars, and they don't go away without surgery like capillary hemangioma does. Oh, Lord, it's all so confusing. I met the most amazing people today, though. I never want to go to war, but I'm so proud of them. Poor man...lost his arm...his right arm...He is only eight years older than I am. I gave Amanda a note on Wednesday, but she still doesn't talk to me or mention me in her journal. Apparently she's really happy lately. Maybe it was all me not being around. Whatever. I'm glad she had a good day. I know mine stunk except for sleeping in and meeting Mark at the hospital. ---- Currents: {x} current clothes: Red OM track team hoodie, OM Cross-country shorts, Nike socks, Adidas sandals. Yeah, I'm dressed down. Don't usually dress like this. {x} current mood: In pain, but cheerful all the same. {x} current taste: Water. {x} current hair: Half up in a messy bun, the rest down and curled. I was bored this morning. {x} current annoyance: My birthmark stings and is annoying the hell out of me. {x} current smell: Huh? {x} current thing you ought to be doing: Homework. {x} current desktop picture: Picture of a female knight, with a quote, "Anything men do, women must do twice as well." {x} current book: Re-reading "Little Women," which I last read two years ago after Christmas. {x} current refreshment: Water. {x} current worry: Hmm... {x} current crush: I've learned not to tell a soul. --- Oh, I can't wait till the next meet. I do well when people doubt me. When someone says I can't do something, I want to do more, do better; I want to prove them wrong. I won't back down from anybody.
EEEEEEEE!!!!! I JUST got back from the first meet at Northeast! IT WAS SO AWESOME!!!!!!!! Caitlyn ran the mile, and she got a PR by like, forty seconds. I was so proud of her! Kate got a PR too, it was really awesome. The girls for OM track are off to a great start! I got a PR for my two-mile time! YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got sixth baby!!!! And I only got sixth by a little so I was really close to fifth. YAYYYYY! I was so happy! I ran the 800 too, but there were like fifty other girls running it, most of which were from SP. Keniesha did really well on the hurdles and high jump. It was very awesome... OVERALL: OM girls got SECOND place. Guys got FIRST place. WHOOOT!!! --- Whoa, sorry for all the caps. Was excited... This morning I overslept till almost 6:30. It was baaaaad. Hahaha, but I was well-rested. In theatre arts we spent (as a class) the first five minutes trying to figure out how to get the logo on my spandex shirt (during a race they disqualify you if you haev a logo). It was hilarious. We tried duck tape, masking tape, safety pins, and eventually decided to try wearing it inside-out. Spanish was incredibly boring except we got to have a FIRE DRILL!! YES! What's third period? Oh yeah. Math was boring too. Lunch was funnn though. After C lunch I stayed for D lunch and got to see my homies, Keniesha and Ryan. I saw Courtney too but I don't think she likes me much. The nerves about the meet kicked in and I was like, shaking my water bottle like a psycho person while I waited for Keniesha with Ryan. He probably thought I had ADD or something. Science was boring too. Mrs. Smith kept yelling at me. I have no idea why... THEN THE MEET. See above. **smiles** I don't have to go to school tomorrow! I have surgery tomorrow. Scarrrrrrryyyyy stuff man. Sooooo tired....Lactic acid building up in thighs....dying....soooooo tired....exhaust.... ---- Wanna quit and give up; Simon says to pack it up. Shot down from all sides... Don't know why I try! So take this and kiss it... Goodbye won't miss it! Wanna go back to L.A. I don't belong, that's what they say. Back again, one more time. Couldn't keep me down las time! Leaving what I know on faith, To take on the world and make waves. Still standing defiant, May be me against the giant. But Rome wasn't built in a day: Game's going on, so I'll still play!
Awwww I had two awesome days! Okay, yesterday, Tuesday night: INDOOR TRACK BANQUET! The food was really good. I sat with Jenn, Sarah, Shanika, Chantel, and Tim. Then they had the awards!!!! They started giving out the graduation numbers for the JV people, and I honestly thought I was getting one, because I remember that I thought I missed my letter by two points. But then, I was the ONLY FRESHMAN to get my letter. Yay me! And that's not even the best part! I got a plaque for winning the award as "Best Freshman!" Sure, they spelled my name wrong, but Coach L. said she'd exchange it and get it spelled right. On to today... I worked with Hoes today in Agriscience! The boys were making really bad jokes about it. We were re-planting plants by the CATN sign. Mrs. Roos came over and said our flower bed looked like a mole had come through it! Grr... :-( P.E. sucked, as usual. In Government we had to research different towns to decide where we'd move in the future. It all seemed quite pointless to me, but whatever... I saw Kendra today. English sucked, as usual. It was even worse today because it became PAINFULLY obvious that we have a few seriously moronic people in the class. Goodness, some of them are just plain STUPID. I'm not even joking, or being mean on purpose or anything like that. It's just stupid. Silly. Then, Amanda and I are still fighting. I don't understand how people can get so pissed off over seriously stupid things, ESPECIALLY when the person in the wrong apologizes. Honestly, I don't think there's much else I can do anymore to make it better. She's just so stubborn sometimes. I guess that's always why I related to her, but now it just stinks. I suppose if it doesn't work out in the end it's just another friendship come and gone, which seriously stinks. I'm running as a scorer tomorrow in two events. I'm the only girl running the two-mile for OM, and I'm also scoring for the open 800. I'm so exhausted! "Now let's just remain this way till plans change by fate, not by us and our stupid misunderstandings," --Keniesha.

Things are cooling off, but I still feel like crap. **works on finishing a Tapestry post** I have to do ticket-selling duty tomorrow, but I like that lunch so maybe I switch to C lunch on B-days for selling tickets. The damned awkward silences today were terrifying. I should have just sat with Sarah and Courtney, but I wanted to at least try saying something, anything to Amanda, but then the look on her face made me change my mind. **a lot has been edited because I've calmed down** Besides that, at track today I found out what I'll be running. The two-mile didn't surprise me, but the open 800!?!?! That was a shocker. They're getting all these sprinters to run the 4x8. Well, there ya go. Life sucks sometimes, but it's not gonna kill me (though I know some people wish it would). Keniesha wouldn't look me in the face, wouldn't nod acknowledgement, wouldn't say a word. *shrug* I guess she's still mad at me too. Other than her and Amanda, none of my other friends are pissed off at me, I don't think. ;-) All this crap all at once. I wish I could say that something good happened today, but not really. Three days till meet, four to surgery. Mom is a million miles away and she hasn't called yet. My grandmother was put in the hospital for two nights...I dunno. The worst part about that is that my dad can't leave while my mom is gone. **edited again because I've calmed down** Again, this song is so strangely there... I'm full of regret For all the things that I have done and said And I don't know If it will ever be okay to show My face 'round here Sometimes I wonder if I disappear Would you ever turn your head and look See if I'm gone, 'Cause I fear There is nothing left to say to you That you wanna hear, That you wanna know... I think I should go The things I've done are way to shameful... Awwwwwwwwww...........ARGGGGGGGG..........*bangs head on wall* I AM SO STUPID!!!
I've been the needle and the thread, Weaving figure eights and circles round your head. I try to laugh, but cry instead... Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said." Mr. Mike told us all to read one chapter of any book of the Bible a day. I started with Psalms. My favorite is 144, but I'm not sure why. Mr. Mike started at Romans and said it was really hard to understand what was being talked about and why, unless he had all these other sources to cross-reference from. Tonight at Sunday School we drew our own "Passion of the Christ" for the Religion Fair next week. We drew our own depictions of the chapters of Matthew that tell about the death resurrection of Jesus. My picture was about "Peter's Denial of Jesus". It was fun. It's not always rainbows and butterflies, It's compromise -- it moves us along... **works diligently on Tapestry and White Horse posts**
Went for a change. Dunno why. Mom left today, and dad went to take General back to the vet hospital again. Shelby is somewhere, and I'm here. Here. I'm gonna miss mom so much. In any case, I've had a crap weekend that I'm going to try and forget about, or at least try and make it better as I can. I'll bend over backwards to make things better but it requires people to understand that I do make mistakes and I am sorry for them. It seems I'm always making mistakes, but I'll promise anyone that I would never make the same mistake twice. I was ticked off at myself yesterday for being stupid, but now it seems a little stupid. I mean, I'll always be sorry, but what am I supposed to do if someone won't accept my apology? Anyway, I'm starting to feel a little better because I know it can't get any worse than this. I have my first meet on Thursday. There's the whole surgery thing on Friday but I'm only worried about it if I have to go to school looking worse than I do every other day. :-) I really, really don't want to go to school this week. I never really want to go to school anyway, but this week, I can already tell it will be a load of not-so-hot stuff... I'm full of regret For all the things that I have done and said And I don't know If it will ever be okay to show My face 'round here Sometimes I wonder if I disappear Would you ever turn your head and look See if I'm gone, 'Cause I fear There is nothing left to say to you That you wanna hear, That you wanna know... I think I should go The things I've done are way to shameful... Mandy cheered me up today. She's good at that because she's always happy and she lives right down the street. Johnen walked over to my neighborhood randomly and said he was just stopping by. See, it's already getting better than yesterday morning...I just don't want to go to school tomorrow...
Please don't read if you dislike violence and unhappiness. Minor language. Feeling: Like crap. I'm incredibly pissed off at Keniesha and I'm full of remorse for Amanda, but there's nothing I can do anymore and it's all blown up in my face and I feel like crap that's been stepped on. Thinking: I'm gonna kill Keniesha. Drinking: Water... Eating: Nothing...I'm starving... Listening to: REM - Everybody Hurts. Okay, this is it. I can't handle Keniesha anymore. She's a bloody pain in the ass and she's made me feel like I'm useless and that everyone hates me. Maybe that's true but it's not cool. It's not cool. I needed to handle it so I canceled and made a mistake with one of the only people who was my friend. I shouldn't have, and I'm sorry, but this bullshit Keniesha is pulling is killing me and I want her out of my life. Keniesha is freakin bipolar and maybe she doesn't realize that what she does hurts people. I know I might have this problem too, but I'd never ever ruin someone's life the way she's tearing mine apart. Yeah, this seems overdramatized, but she's messing with my life as if she can't control hers. It's like hers has gone down the tubes so she's taking care of mine. I'm going to avoid Keniesha at all costs. Like Kendra said, if we just cut her off at the knees she'll just get worse, we need to ignore her entirely. This crap has gone on long enough and I can't handle it anymore. Keniesha, leave me the hell alone! --- The cats went to the vet yesterday: Sundae needs to lose a few pounds, Charlotte is too skinny, needs to gain a few pounds, And, just to add to the rest of the crap of the day... General Posy is as old as I am and he might have some form of cat cancer. Why me?
"Ohana means family, and family means 'No one gets left behind.'" I love the Ohana I was born into. I love the friends that have become my Ohana. I love the places that have been homes to my Ohana(s). I love my track team Ohana (credit to Caitlyn). I love my cats, the sweetest part of my Ohana. I miss Midnight, who will always be remembered by my Ohana. I love my Ohanas! They get me through Hell and high water. I still feel like crying though. I just don't know if I have the strength to.
I just feel like crying. And if I bleed, I'll bleed... Knowing you don't care. If I sleep just to dream of you But wake without you there, Isn't something missing? Isn't someone missing me? I've had such a crummy day. First off, it felt like it was a Monday, which is always a horrid thing. Well, actually, my day started pretty well, but it transformed into a not-so-hot day later on. I went to pick Mandy up since my mom offered to drive us to school. Her three-year old brother Tyler slid down the steps and screamed, "Mallowee, Mallowee is here! My girwlfriend come to say hi!" So I guess I have a three-year old boyfriend... :-) Yay~ He makes me feel loved. ;-) Theatre arts was boring. Spanish was boring -- but I got a 46/50 (92%) on my Negative Tù commands quiz. Yay. Math stunk. Biology was quite interesting. Then Keniesha ruined my day by blackmailing me just because she has a quick temper and wanted payback for something I didn't do. She's pissed cause she needs a psychiatrist and her record's ruined, but it's not my fault and all I try to do is be the mediator between my two friends, and it all freakin (excuse me, sorry) blows up in my face. I wanted to smack Keniesha, but I couldn't because it wouldn't be right. Why am I the middle-woman here? Why? Why me? I don't mean to feel self-centered or sorry for myself, because I'm not. I just don't get it. "A friendship's not a friendship if it's hard." If it was hard to be friends with someone, you wouldn't be friends. If keeping a steady ground as friends was too hard to handle, two people just aren't friends. That's why (the first example that comes to mind) Paula and Hannah and people like that aren't friends with me, because it's too hard. I'm not a wuss, not a baby, but when you can't be friends you aren't friends. I'm even getting lost in my own reasonings. But hey, on the bright side, I did 25 seconds faster on my timed mile today than last week, and 10 seconds faster than the first time I did the timed mile. I'm pretty happy, I guess. Yes, very happy. Caitlyn improved her time by 20 seconds, and has improved by three minutes since the first day of practice. Yay for Caitlyn! "I love my track Ohana!" --Caitlyn... Five days until the meet, six until surgery. Still counting down. At least I get out of Mr. Bright's class and Mrs. Parker's class...most of P.E. too, next Friday. I don't know how that next Monday will turn out though. "And if you do not want to see me again... I would understand. Can you put the past away?"
Ahhhhh. A lot happened today, I think. At Agriscience we worked with Thyme and the nodes of already planted seedlings. We snipped the branches at the internodes and dunked them in powdered plant hormone, then planted them. Mrs. Roos gave us our own little plants to take home, called "Devil's Backbone". She told us to hide them though, or Mrs. Cornelius would take them away and do evil things to our permanent record. Roos also showed us a live Black Widow Spider. Most of the girls acted like such wussies and screamed, and I was a bit freaked out but it was in a bottle for goodness sakes! I got to see it's little red hourglass. In P.E. not a lot happened really, I don't think. Tyrone was really really starting to get on my nerves because he kept calling me China and acting like we were Power Rangers, telling me to, "use [your] powers, China!" It's not that I don't like him because he's mentally challenged, it's because he never pays attention! But he's funny though, and I know to stay patient with him. In government we took the first Unit Test for the Foreign Policy unit. It stunk! Errrg. It wasn't hard, but it was really stupid. I dunno...just not fun or anything. We had to write a lot of essays. Stuff about the President's role being affected by congress and stuff like that. Hahahaha! In English we watched Romeo and Juliet the movie. The costumes were hilarious! It was completely weird and funny. The guys wore tights that were like the spandex and underarmor people wear to track, except that we wear the spandex with shorts and shirts overtop! Track was funny. I had to run my five miles. However, the baseball people kept purposefully throwing their baseballs over the fence and into the stadium. One of them hit Jack. Then it was funyn because all the track guy sprinters were telling off the laughing baseball people, who immediately backed off. Then Spalding came over and I got mad because they stole our track. For people who pay so much just to get into and go to school, you'd think they'd have their own track! Tomorrow Coach L will have the roster for what we're going to run on Thursday. I'm looking at the two-mile race and the 4x8 relay. Maybe the one-mile instead of the two mile, but most likely one of those two and the 4x8. 6 days until the meet, seven until the surgery. Yes, I'm counting down. My mom said she might give me a ride to school tomorrow. Yay! I can say hi to all my friends in the morning! Usually I either have to go to CATN or my bus comes too late for me to see them before the bell rings. Grr.... Je suis fatigue (That's right, isn't it? I don't take french..) "Blessed be the Lord my strength, Who teacheth my hands to war, And my fingers to fight." --Psalm 144, a Psalm of David
Ehhhhhhhhhh. I just found out my surgery is scheduled for next Friday, the day after the first track meet. At least it's a Friday, so I don't have to go to school the next day or anything. Caffeine is good. I want my Sunflower to finish growing. I have to write my Bellyn/Bella intro. I started it, but I still have a long way to go. I'm so tired.... Funny site: googlism.com You type in your name and loads of funny stuff comes up. Randomness.... "Viel Aufhebens von etwas machen!" -Keniesha, describing Mallory. No, I don't speak German and no, I don't remember what it means. Something about music and dance or somesuch.
'Allo folks. Happy Saint Patrick's day to you all! I made Irish Lace Cookies last night and brought a few to school today. Some people liked them, but Ryan laughed and said they tasted like cereal with the oats and brown sugar. LoL. It's true, though, I guess. Not my recipe though! The hardest part was getting the damn cookies off the cooking sheet when they were done in the oven. They're so thin and connected by bits of brown sugar/butter or whatever, and they crack and crumble if you're not careful. Anyway, moving on. In Theatre Arts we learned about makeup. Krystle did Lindsay's makeup to make her look like a rosie-cheeked three year old, and I did Jacob's makeup to make him look like a really old man. Lindsay turned out great, but Jacob looked more like he was dead than he did an eighty-year old man. Ech. Spanish was kind of boring today. We had a timed write where we had to describe 'un monstruo' (monster) or 'una persona con muchas partes de el cuerpo' (a person with a lot of body parts). When we were done we paired up and we had to read our description to our partner, who, in turn, tried to draw the monster (All of this being conducted in Spanish, of course). Mine looked really scary. Five elbows, polka-dots, and arms that are longer than legs tend to do that. Math was boring So was lunch. So was Biology. Ugh. Track sucked. Track hurt so bad. Now I'm tired. :-) SEVEN DAYS UNTIL THE FIRST MEET OF THE OUTDOOR SEASON!!!! WHOOT!!!! Feeling: Happy, cheerful (as usual) but extremely and excruciatingly tired. Eating: Nothing, but I'm so hungry!!! Drinking: YO BEBANDO EL AGUA !!!!!!!!! SI! Mad At: *grumbles* damn Maryland weather. Freaky weather... Listening to: My Uncle's newest CD, "Only a Fool". Writing: Meh. This and that...MUST GO TO LIBRARY!
I can't really remember what went down yesterday at school, so I'll just talk about today. It was weird today... Okay, first of all...It's mid-March, right? Right!?! Please tell me why it was snowing when I left for school, then pouring when I was at CATN? I hate this FREAKY Maryland weather. Actually, not just MD weather, but the WHOLE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES doesn't seem to want spring. In Agriscience we planted loads and loads and loads of pots full of sunflower seeds. I took one home with me in a mini-pot and it is supposed to grow in ten or so days. Funnnnnn. When it's done growing I'm gonna pick it! I'm gonna pick a flower that I grew! It will be extra special. My own special flower. Awwwww.... P.E. stunk. I love sports, but this Team Sports elective is just the pits. I don't know anyone in the class really, 'cause most of the ninth-graders and tenth-graders that I know are taking Fitness for Life and most of the upper-classmen that I know are taking Aerobics or some such elective. I played volleyball again. Grrrr. I hate Volleyball. Give me a damn soccer ball and I'd be happy enough. In Government Mr.Bright singled me out. He said that I went above and beyond on a certain activity and that I was ahead of the rest of the class, saying he'd always recommend me for any AP Social Studies class. It sucked because it was in front of the whole class. I know I'm glad I'm getting compliments from someone as weird and senile and cold-hearted teacher there is, but in front of the class? They all thought I was a teacher's pet. It sucked. Oh well. He said he was definitely going to talk to the office and ask for me to have AP European History next year instead of Honors World Civ. Jake: "Wait, Mallory...European History means everywhere but the U.S., right?" ::rolls eyes:: English was plain boring. We had a test on Act 1 of Romeo and Juliet. It was really easy. I like Tybalt the best. Romeo is so superficial. :-) Mostly I like Tybalt because he's the one I read for, and Tybalt wants to kill Romeo who is played by none other than JOSH. Hahahaha! Track was indoors. It stunk too. BUT TOMORROW IS ST. PATRICK'S DAY! I'm making cookies. I'm part Irish so I'll make Irish Lace Cookies. I refuse to wear green though other than maybe a green hairtie. Mostly because I do not own green clothing. Happy Saint Pattie's day everyone. Tomorrow.
Wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend You could cut ties with all the lies you've been living in And if you do not want to see me again I would understand I would understand Monday morning. ::rolls eyes:: In theatre arts our warm-up was a trust one where someone is picked up by seven or so people and them spun around at waist level. Everyone was like, "Oh, I'm too fat," or "I weigh to much!" Which was really stupid because two of the girls were sticks and the other three weren't fat or anything. Maybe bigger than me, but not fat or anything. I was just like, "This is stupid, let's just go!" and then after they were done they were all happy and thought it was really cool. It was cool. I felt light as a feather. In Spanish I have a 99.5, which really surprised me since last semester with Mrs. Beall I barely had a 90. An A is good in the first place, but I've got basically a 100. I guess Ms. Sharrer is just way more fun and child-like at heart. Math has turned into gibberish with its polynomials. Looks like a baby smashed his hands on a keyboard and they printed it onto a math worksheet. Somehow I've been getting by with a 90 on the last test and worksheets and whatnot. I despise math, but I'm not bad at it or anything. Hahaha! In Biology we studied the reproductive ways of our own chosen animal. Jenny chose a Jackrabbit, and she learned that their gestation period (length of pregnancy) is only 41-47 days. Sarah is researching Sea Otters and she learned that they mate and have their babies in the water. I'm researching mongeese and all I learned was that Rikki Tikki Tavi from Rudyard Kipling was a mongoose and that they are banned from Canada and the U.S. Yes, I have my priorities straight, don't I? :-) Ran four miles for my work out today, and a mile for warm up and a mile for cool down. Six miles isn't too bad, but not as much as I usually do. It was all at a 6:30 pace. I was tired as anything when I was done though.
Not a bad day. Nope, not bad at all. I want to go to the Library soon, but I keep forgetting the times since I lost my library card a long time ago. So I haven't been yet...I need to do something Spring-ish, and I guess going to the Library makes me feel like it's almost Summer again. I always use to go to the Library during the Summer because I had nothing else to do and it had really awesome air conditioning. I'm such a dork... ;-) I've been really happy and hyper lately. It feels like Spring is near, even if it's still crazy weather on the outside. I went to church this morning and saw Chris, Mrs. Betty, and Mike. Lindsay sang the whole time, it was cool. She's hilarious, Lindsay is...she's in my Theatre Arts class. She's such a goof ball... Anyway, I'd imagine that the only cause for upset feelings lately has been the malfunctioning of my electric tuner. Grrr. So now I've resorted to using my old piano to tune my guitars. I've been playing one song lately that requires Drop-D tuning, but my acoustic was successfully set to standard tuning this morning. At sparring class on Wednesday, Joey is going down. Sure, he might be fifty pounds heavier than I am, a year older than I am, and three inches taller than I am, but I'm so set on kicking him to the ground next round of sparring. Mrs. Betty says it's horrible to be fighting like in TKD, but it's not like we're learning how to kill people or anything. It's fun exercise. Speaking of exercise, I'm counting down the days until the first triple meet! Eeeee! The twenty-fifth...only eleven more days! Eeeeeeeeee! Running makes me so happy. I'm definitely running the 4 by 8, and either the mile or the two-mile. Probably the two-mile. Feeling: Happy, hyper, cheerful. Listening to: Everclear's version of "Breakfast at Tiffany's," Third Eye Blind "Jumper," Disney Classic's "Ugly Bug Ball" and "The Spectrum Song," and I've been playing and teaching myself Evanescence's song "Whisper". Eating: This and that. Nothing in particular. Drinking: Water. It's good for you. Procrastinating: Homework!
Kyrie elison, Christe elison, Kyrie elison... I saw Secret Window yesterday. It was okay. It's one of the only movies I've seen where the bad guy wins or at least the good guy doesn't win. Besides "The Empire Strikes Back," which ends with Han Solo getting dipped in chocolate and Luke getting his hand chopped off. Other than that...yeah...it was pretty good. Johnny Depp is hot with messy dyed hair and even without eye makeup. I was going to go on a field trip with my Sunday School class to the John Paul II Cultural Center, but not enough people wanted to go. It was a bit short-notice, but I thought it might have been fun...maybe... Not much else is going on, really...
Soy viviente vida solo. It snowed today. In less than a week we've had eighty-degree weather, rain, shine, wind, and snow. It's crazy spring weather, and it's making me more crazy by the day. I can't stand this weather. In Agriscience at CATN we made corsages. It was kind of fun. Then we left the greenhouse and it was snowing. Amber and I were the last people on the OM bus. In P.E. we started volleyball. It was incredibly boring. Govt. and English were boring too. Track is killing me almost. I ran four miles today in under seven and a half minutes each, though my first mile was a lot faster than seven minutes. There was also warm-up and cool-down too. I have Tae Kwon Do now! Yay! It's Wednesday class so I'm happy.
I swear I just saw the scariest TV commercial in the history of modern television. I honestly have never seen something so horrifying. THE QUIZNOS COMMERCIAL! That commercial is so messed up! It makes me want to hide under my bed and never come out. Those gerbils need an orthodontist, and must NEVER EVER SING AGAIN! It is such a freaky commercial. It's honestly the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life. But at the same time, it's also the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. :-) We went to our second CATN rotation, and now I have Agriscience. It looks incredibly stupid, and I hate bugs so I don't know what I'll do. But the greenhouse is really really warm so it's not terrible or anything. Other than that...not much...
I went bike riding with Shelb today. Meh... Then I came home to make a scrapbook page and I found all these old photos of where we've been and where we've lived. I saw the photos of Alex and me in Scotland at the Guy Fawkes Bonfire parade thingy...photos of Puerto Rico after Hurrican Hugo...photos of Iceland and Germany and when my dad went to Luxembourg (sp?) to see where his family was from...stuff like that. It was really cool. Kind of mind-boggling since America is so boring and wrapped up in itself and I just don't like it here. " I've been all over the world, I've seen a million different places... Right through the crowds and all the faces... I'm still out there looking for you. " I still have Sunday School tonight, too...
Yay! Weekend. It's almost over though...grrr.... On Saturday I woke up at eight so we could catch the 10:20 showing of Hidalgo. It got bad reviews but I really wanted to see it. I invited Amanda but she wasn't around when I called on Friday and it was too short notice for her to come when I called on Sunday. I felt bad for waking her up. Sorry Amanda. :-) In any case, it was a really good movie. It did seem a bit cliche with him being the son of an Indian chief's daughter and a white calvary man. However, Viggo did a wonderful job acting the part, and I'm glad he was able to sucessfully drop the Aragorn in him and pick up the Hawkins in him. I love Hidalgo! Makes me miss Midnight for some reason, and makes me want to be around GenGen, Sundae, and Charlotte more...Poor Horsie... Then I came home and played Cups with Keyan, Jorge, Maribel, and Shelby. It was hilarious. I totally lost, I had CUPSSSSSSS because I lost so many times and they still let me play even though I should have been 'out'. It was funny. After that I went running at the Airport Park, three miles. I got just over 24 minutes, which isn't very good but isn't incredibly slow either. Somewhere in the middle. It makes me feel better to know that I run better than most of the people in my gym class and at least a portion of my High School. I keep telling my self that...I'm starting to think I should run the mile event instead of a two-mile. I got a damn good time at that last Armory Meet for my split mile. But I'm probably also on the 4 by 8 team. So then I came home and went to bed. Went to church this morning and now I'm going to Kohl's to buy a new pair of running shoes. Why we're going to Kohl's eludes me, but maybe they're having a sale or something and my mom wants to make the most of it. Something like that. Dunno. Ewwww...school tomorrow. And it's a B-Day too, so it will really really stink. Having Monday be a B-day is one of the worst things...Well, at least it means no more carpentry. Besides that, it also means that the Team Locker room will be open finally and I can grab a locker for Jenn and Kendra and me.
Had a good day today. Yay! Actually it was very uneventful. In Theatre Arts we had a substitute and had to do bookwork with lots of questions at the end of the readings. Really stupid questions, the kind that have the answer in the question. "How could you change the voice to make the transation from narrative to dialogue?" Uhh...change the tone of voice...right? It was just really stupid is all. Spanish was so much fun! We started singing since we were learning the tú form for commands. We sang the original verb then the tú conjugation, and if we sang loud enough we got extra points. We sang so loud, this boy from another Spanish class came in laughing, "Viva la revolucíon!" (Rough translation: Long live the revolution!) It was hilarious. Algebra was boring, but I got an A on my test so it wasn't bad or anything. Just boring. Biology was so much fun! We're starting to review stuff from 6th and 7th grade like asexual reproduction and stuff like that, but that's not the point, really. It was just fun. We talked about so many random things it was just fun for once. Like, somehow we got on the subject of what was for lunch...randomness... Richard : Yeah, they had no casedillas today at lunch! Jenny : I know I was so mad! They said they ran out... Mrs. Smith : You guys know you can make your own casedillas at home, right? Richard : Oh yeah, I do that. Just take white bread and cheese and put it in the microwave or on the stove. Mrs. Smith : That's called grilled cheese, hun. Then we actually got back on track, and then we got to where we were talking about fragmentation. It's a form of asexual reproduction where if you cut off part of the parent cell, it will just grow into a regular cell and the old one just grows back. When pieces of the parent cell break off to form a new organism...anyway... Andrew : Like when lizards cut off their tails? Matt : Yeah and they grow back! Beth : That's not the same thing... Mrs. Smith : Right, because when lizards lose their tails they just grow a new tail, it's not like the tails grow out into a new lizard and they share a tail. Me : Oh, but that would be so cool! It was just fun. Track was exhausting. I ran the timed mile to set my pace per mile for next week and got 6:30. Not as good as I was during indoor, but it's been two weeks since I ran so it's okay. After that I had to run four continuous miles. It was okay, I was just tired and sore. I need to run three miles tomorrow and five on Sunday. Tired...
I didn't like the white. It was boring. Hah! Back to the red and...peach? No...off-white? Creamy?? Dunno. Back to the red and other colors. :-) Today was tiring. Very. In theatre arts we performed our pantomime skits. Our group didn't choose which idea we were doing until last class, and didn't even rehearse it until five minutes prior to performing. Somehow we pulled off being the second-best out of five. Not too bad for random Santa Claus stuff...I was pleasantly surprised. I sighed up to sell tickets at three lunches and two of the nights of the shows. That should equal up to my five hours of crew-work required for the class. Mrs. Parker isn't really the teacher...now that I think of it...she doesn't really teach, Mrs. Revel (sp?) does. And Mrs. Revel isn't even from our school! It's messed up. Spanish was fun. It's always fun now. A lot more fun than when I had Mrs. Beall. We had a test in Math, but I thought it was really kinda easy. I don't know if that should make me worried, but I flew through it and finished the extra credit paper before class ended with time to spare. It was easy work...wow... Alex kept stealing my nachos. He kept playing tricks and stealing them on the sly. It was kind of funny almost. Then Pepe and I talked about why Kendra had been crying the other day...It was almost a relief to get it all off my shoulders, even though I didn't tell her everything... Bio was boring except for our conversation about Power Rangers. I remember that show. I used to love it... Track just kind of sucked. Dunno. My times were pretty good though. I don't have to go to CATN or have P.E. tomorrow! I have an Orthodontist appointment at eight, so I'm skipping votech and I'll be too late to P.E. to get dressed. Awesome! Yay! I get my next set of invisalign. It will hurt...I know it will...like it did last time...ahh well... Now I still have TKD. Grrr....He made us stay until nine last week! It ticked me off...and my dad too. It's getting really frustrating... Wow my mom said she saw Mrs. Janet (Paula's mom) at curves today. LoL. Mom said she looked as young and pretty as she did when they first met almost twenty years ago. I haven't seen her in over a year, maybe two or three. She was always a nice lady. She was cool. Then again, most parents that aren't mine seem awesome to me. Like Kendra's mom, Keniesha's dad, both of Johnen's parents...etc. Not much else...cept for some random stuff that happened after school but before practice...
Arggggggh. Life stinks. I'm sure you all have figured this out already, but sometimes it's just not cool for it to pop out all at once on you screaming, "YES, I'M LIFE AND I'M HERE TO MAKE YOU MISERABLE!" Then laugh in your face. Yeah. That's how psycho not-happy I am today. In Carpentry we were putting the white wire shelving on our walls. At one point during the lecture Mr. Bury says, "And if you do this right I promise you'd be able to sit on it!" So when we go to do our walls everyone else it putting thiers at four feet or so, and Alayna goes, "Why don't we put it low enough so we can try sitting on it?" We tried! Eeeeh! We finished and Alayna sat on it, and it held. Mr. Bury came over and smiles, telling everyone else to listen up. "This is the perfect example of how a shelf should be made. It's strong enough to--" Right when he says this, Alayna falls as the shelf bends. It was rather funny because everyone was paying attention and just as Mr. Bury is saying how great ours was it topples -- after staying strong for five whole minutes. Alayna and I were laughing so hard. P.E. was the usual. Government was the usual. English was the usual. (I learned that if you murder someone after planning it you get a longer jail sentence than if you'd just randomly murdered someone. Wow.) First day of outdoor! Eeeeh! Actually a lot more happened to day, involving Team Sports lockers that I don't want to go into, but let me just say that it caused my backpack to gain five pounds throughout the day. Now I'm very tired, and this one girl I know has been hurting herself and my friend and I don't know what to do. The girl broke a promise to my friend by hurting herself, and things just aren't going so well. Tae Kwon Do now, then a free day tomorrow. Except for practice at 9:30. Election day! How wonderful! +shrugs+ I could care less, honeslty. All I have to worry about is the 2008 election, since I'll be old enough to vote by a mere four months. Maybe five...what's June to November? I guess five. Oh, but I can't vote in 2008 primaries...won't be old enough... So tired...must...have...day...off...from...school...

"...It was really too bad that they'd tied him up. He couldn't even die in a valiant attempt at escape. Of course, he could always lie on the floor in a threatening manner. Or maybe, if he really made an effort, he could twitch aggressively..." Gargh. I have D lunch tomorrow because of the stupid run/walk-athon. Stupid. It's for a good cause, yes, but I just don't want to do it. I will, but I don't want do. +sigh+
Another meet. I shouldn't have gone today. It was for underclassmen OR for people who don't usually score. I'm an underclass(wo)man but I have enough varsity points for two people so I didn't really need to go. I guess I just wanted to go and get out of practice. Ryan and Alex were at the meet...but they sat with the Cougars like little bizznitches (homez). Coach Nelson went...even though the Juniors and Seniors were acting like idiots on Friday. So I ran the mile...got a 6:22. Not a PR, but I've done worse. I ran the 800 too, and got a 2:54. Shanika got shoved and fell, which tripped a SP girl, which stopped their heat of the 800. Shanika was bleeding...lol...she did the 4x4 with me anyway. I'm not a sprinter...lol...but they didn't have enought people for the 4x4 cause everyone was ditching and stuff. So I ran. We got third place and I had a 1:16. Looks like my report cards gonna have six As and two Bs. Good. Now my parents won't freak like they did when they saw my report card when I had Mrs. Mirabile. Talent show is coming up soon. Amanda wants to sing while I play guitar. +shrug+ Hah! Chris was singing this seventies TV show theme song when I got home...I love Chris! Secret Agent Man! Secret Agent Man! They've given you a number, And taken away your name. Beware of pretty faces that you find... A pretty face can hide an evil mind! Be careful what you say, Or you'll give yourself away. Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow. Still playing Another Brick in the Wall prt. 2 though. Yay.
And I see you standing there, Wanting more from me, And all I can do is try. And I see you standing there, I'm all I'll ever be , And all I can do is try.
Hey ya'll. It's been a while, eh? Ummm...we had a meet today. I did some middle-distance relays and a sprint medly, and I did fine but I've fully come to terms that I am a one-mile, two-mile, and three-mile runner the best. Some of the guys on the back of the bus on the way home were being incredibly stupid and freestyling. Coach N asked them to stop and they mocked her and acted really obnoxious. I hope Coach N doesn't quit, because those cocky boys with senioritis are really getting on her nerves more than they are getting on anyone else's nerves. FOURTH PERIOD ENGLISH ROCKED!!!

Happy Easter everyone! I loved Mass today -- I saw all these people from High School that I know! Yay!! Rachel was singing, as was Lindsay, and that dude who sits in front of me in Spanish that always gets in the newspaper for baseball was there...it was awesome. There was a funny Homily because Father Nick asked all the children to go up and help him explain how easter eggs came about to help symbolize new life, etc. It was hilarious because the kids say the funniest things up there... In any case, despite the happy, springy feel of today I couldn't help but keep worrying about Amanda. She won't tell me anything, and I know she's hurting herself or doing something, but she won't talke to me about any of it. I know some things are better left alone, and not everything is my business, but honestly if it's something as serious as this to the point where I never know if I'll see Amanda the next school day, then I think something must be done. I don't want to lose another friend, especially if that friend is Amanda. I would never forgive myself if Amanda died. I just don't know what to do... In this world of circumstance Children never fear forever And this moment that enchants Someday we will both remember Then, maybe then If we are still alive Then, maybe then This moment will survive... There is time in every word There are words in every reason And these notes that are unheard One day they may find their season Then, maybe then If we are still alive Then, maybe then This monent will survive... Will survive... urlLink adopt your own virtual pet! Teehee...

"...I've been all over the world, I've seen a million different places. Right through the crowds and all the faces, I'm still out there looking for you..." Where has my spring weekend run off to? It's Saturday, and I only get Monday off now so it seems to be passing me by without me doing anything particularly special. Grandma sent a card with five dollars in it for Easter, and said she misses me and loves the long letters I send her every few weeks. Well, I love her and I think she must be terribly lonely up north without Grandpa now, with only the freezing cold wind and Sugar Loaf mountain to keep her company. Still, Lord knows I needed those five dollars since I spent the last of my own money for the last payment for the Canada trip. HA! I'm poor. Mom's painting the hallways again. Man, my house is like a madhouse! We have builders adding to the kitchen and upper level, my mom is painting the hall, Shelby is cleaning out the shed, and it just seems a lot more like spring building than spring cleaning. Thursday night I talked online with Ryan and Keniesha until I couldn't keep my eyes open. On Friday I didn't really do much. I used two pieces of wood and hammered them together to make a cross (or the letter 't' whichever you prefer). Then I painted it blue and shoved it into the garden dirt just in time for noontime of Good Friday to roll around. Today I haven't done anything. I can't wait for Easter. I don't know why...I guess it's just like it's officially spring or something. And I'm sick of the rain already, since it always seems to rain whenever we have a meet (grr....) but I love spring and fall, so I can't wait... Besides, Easter and Christmas are the only Holidays I wear skirts for (Besides the sports banquets) and dress up for.
Okay, I know that I shouldn't be taking or posting these weirdo quiz results, but they came from Amanda's greatest journal so I had to take them myself...Sorry...lol Your True Nature by urlLink llScorpiusll Username The quality that most appeals to you: Courage In a survival situation, you: Act crazy as a diversion Your hidden talent is: Spiritual wisdom Your gift is: A loving heart In groups, you: Blend in Your best quality is: Your generosity Your weakness is: Your timidity Created with urlLink quill18 's urlLink MemeGen 3.0 !

Hmm.... Well, now that it's spring break (well, spring WEEKEND) I have more time for the BDs. Things have been hectic lately, but now I've got a little break. YAY!!
Hmm. I don't really remember Tuesday or Wednesday. This morning I woke up late since I had an orthodontist appointment. I got to school in the middle of second period, just in time to play a fun game in Spanish, called Subjunctive Relays or something like that. It was loads of fun. Math was incredibly boring...but I have a B in the class, and that's not bad. This math class is so much better grade-wise than last semester, but I miss all my first semester buddies. I didn't like Mrs. Mirabile, but I loved all the psycho people in that class! Biology was stupid. Just plain stupid. STOOOOOPID (yes, I know I spelled it with *counts*five O's). The invite for track...IT WAS RAINING AND COLD!!!!! ARGHHHH!!! I ran my two-mile, and it was the second to last race. I got a personal record, and got third place. Yay...*eye roll* I have 14 varsity points. Yay. I'm really worried about Amanda. She's so depressed and I'm afraid of what she's doing to herself but she won't tell me anything. She won't talk to me about *it* , and I'm starting to get scared. I don't know what to do. I'm scared... So exhausted... "...And nothing else matters..." --Metallica
Whoa...what a PSYCHO day. Mom is back from GERMANY, and she woke up at 4AM to make waffles. *sighs* Same old mom, yup yup. I was so exhausted from staying up so late on Friday night, having a meet on Saturday, and doing English projects on Sunday all day. So I was extremely tired. Extremely tired. People probably thought I was high or something, and I know Mr. Bright asked what I had had for a drink during lunch...NO!!! I am not a bad person...I WAS JUST TIRED!!! So I get to CATN, and we change our class. I got my twelfth choice - Drafting/CAD. ARGH!!! If I don't get Baking/Pastry next rotation, I'm gonna be so mad...I'm definitely not going back to CATN next year. P.E. made me even more tired. I got locked out, but Nancy let me back inside. Then Courtney Smith shoved Matt out the door and locked him out, and when she shoved him he smacked his elbow against the silver metal push bar that opens the door. His elbow was all bruised...LoL...I felt so bad for him... Government was INCREDIBLY BORING. BAHHHH! We didn't have to take a test...(Happy Passover, everyone!)...Man, do you want to know how bored I was?!? Matt and I were so bored we planned our weddings, our future families, my future husband and his future wife...It was so scary when he told me who his wife would be...but then I laughed so hard! He is so funny...LoL. Lunch was the usual. Gary sat with us, it was funny. I went back upstairs after lunch and saw Keniesha and Andrea. Then I saw Kendra and Ryan. I was so tired by that point, I was on the verge of collapsing, I bet. I was so tired. Kendra and Ryan think I'm psycho. Wait...okay, Kendra knows I'm psycho. Nevermind. *yawns* English was ESTUPIDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got home and cleaned house. Go me. I want a hug...*sighs and collapses*
"I'm so tired Of being here..." The Seahawk Invitational was really cruddy. I hated it. My race was third from the last, so I had to wait three or four hours in the pouring rain and twenty-degree weather, with the only thing I could do being to cheer on my other teammates. Things looked up though, and it stopped raining (or at least it stopped pouring ) in time for my race, and I got a personal record by 12 seconds and got a ribbon for 6th place. It was terrible, and still not too bad...ironic, eh? I made cupcakes last night. I sold tickets to Wizard of Oz today. I got in a big fight with my dad. Now Mom's coming home from Germany and I'm exhausted and in a crappy mood. I want a hug...:-( Not to mention I still have three English projects to finish by tomorrow. Man, life sucks sometimes... "I've been alone All along..."
Hmmmm today was....RAINY. It was so nasty outside. It was terrible! I had my hair down since we were having team pictures this afternoon, but I gave up. My hair was starting to curl in the humidity and downpour. Angriscience was really boring. In Team Sports I played HORSE with Matt, Scuzzy, Teddy, Courtney, and Sarah. In Government I had a funny debate with other classmates about conservatives and liberals and the homework we had. Hahahaha. *rollseyes* I ate lunch with Amanda and Keesha. After lunch, I saw Kendra and Pepe and Ryan. I told Kendra about second place and I was happy again. Man, I know this sounds really boring, doesn't it? I need something exciting to happen, but I know if I ask for something to happen it won't be good... English was incredibly boring. The class is full of MORONS. I think it's everyone but me and Amanda and Amber... Team Pictures took FOREVER. Now I have to go to Tae Kwon Do and I'm exhausted. Grrrrrr!!!! Watching buttercups cup the light Sleeping on a dandelion Too much, I wouldn't touch you But then I might... --Pink Floyd ------ Later... AHHHH!!! The class was full of dudes! Usually Cathrine goes...or Krista...I was the only girl and I was the youngest and I was the SHORTEST!!!!! AHHH!!! This one boy kept farting...ewwwww.... Now I'm very tired, but I can't sleep. It's so psycho and strange...whoa...:-)
Yes, my friends. In nine days I will reach the mature age of fifteen. (Bloodstained Eleanor opens on my BIRTHDAY!! Whoot!) *snickers* I've only asked for a few presents of my parents. Probably because I really don't want much. A new CD player since mine is old and stopped working last week. A new pair of shoes just because mine are getting worn and the shoelaces have frayed and the laces won't lace. Other than that, everything is up to my family's discression. This weekend Amanda and I are going to go see The Day After Tomorrow with my father (though not necessarily *with* him). My gore-scared Aunt is coming into town this Saturday from Minneapolis, and is going with her sister (mum) to see Shrek 2. I've already seen it, and I really want to see TDAT with Amanda. So, yeah...our plans are set. The closer my birthday gets, the more I realize that I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I don't know if I'd ever be able to write professionally. Going into the Naval Academy is at least an eight-year commitment. Music is lovely, and I could do it for my whole life, but in a world where nobody says what they mean everything I like could be lost on the ears of today's objectional population. I don't want to be stuck in a job that I hate, no matter how much it pays and no matter how cliche that sounds. I want a job that I would not mind getting up for every single day of my life. I am small and the world is big... But I'm not afraid of anything. The HSA's kind of suck. They're easy as any test could be, but when you have to sit quietly without anything to do or read and not allowed to sleep for three hours, it gets to you after four days of it. Track went well. I had enough points to get three or four letters, which is all well and good since I worked my ass off for it. I feel fine. In any case, I will get back to this when I am less confused.

I redid the whole thing again from Maroon5 lyrics to Sarah McLachlan lyrics from her song Fallen…most specifically from the second verse. I still love Maroon5, but this song has been on ‘repeat’ and stuck in my head for a good deal of time now… "We all begin with good intent, When love was raw and young. We believed that we could change ourselves; The past could be undone. But we carry on our backs a burden Time always reveals -- In the lonely light of morning, In the wound that would not heal, Is the bitter taste of losing everything I’ve held so dear..." In any case...Happy birthday to Katy and Bryan. Aman, or...shall I say, "Ax" ;-) has gotten me hooked on all the quizzes she puts on her xanga...so this one comes from part of hers... -- [i know]: Music is good. [i want]: More time. [i have]: Sunday School tonight and I have to help with the homeless shelter. [i wish]: I had more time. [i hate]: Hate is such a strong word... [i miss]: The good ol' days. [i fear]: Dogs.

[friend]: Friend[ly] to most, enemy to some. I am the best of friends but the greatest of enemies. [shy]: With people I don't know, yes. With people I know, then of course not. [talkative]: Yes. [adventurous]: Always. [intelligent]: My GPA says yes. -Self-Analysis.You.Probably.Don't.Want.To.Do- [your best feature (personality)]: Amanda says that I am strong and independant, and say what I want no matter what, and Kendra says I'm a leader.

Wow...Amanda was really down today...On GJ she wrote this: "I wish this never happened. I wish I was never born. I wish I was someone else, somewhere else. I wish I was a different person, one with no friends...so no one would care so much about me. I wish I was in the Twin Towers when they collapsed I wish I was nicer, prettier, more confident. I wish I had talent. I wish I would die an' come back as someone else. I just wish everything was different, that no one cared, that I was alone, no family, that I didn't have feelings I wish I was dead...or that I'm not afriad to kill myself. But if I had a gun right now......I'm sorry Katy......sorry mom an' dad....sorry to everyone. I guess I have to revise my suicide letter now. But I swear, if I had a gun right now or some pills...damn, that'd be one sad story. A lotta sorrys. Just to say it now...I never meant to hurt anyone...I didn't do it on purpose an' I'm sorry...this is to anyone I've hurt in the past, an' now." And I was like...WhOA!!!! So I wrote this to cheer her up... "I wish I was prettier, I wish I had a guy that made me feel beautiful and made me feel important, I wish that I used the brain I have to get great grades and I wish I didn't slack on schoolwork like I do, I wish I had all these things that I don't have. And then, Amanda, I think about the things I do have. I have friends (usually) who don't care if I'm pretty or if I'm the butt-ugliest female on the planet, I don't have a boyfriend right now but I realize that if I went for so long, I could wait ten more years for the RIGHT one to come along, and I realize that having a brain and using it as much as I please is better than not having a brain at all, and I realize that all the things I don't have make me more thankful for the things that I DO have." TOMORROW IS OUR YARD SALE!!! WHOOT. LoL... So exhausted...
HAH! I edited the layout wording stuff. Maroon5 lyrics. Whoot. Erg. Tomorrow is counties. GUESS WHAT!?!?!?! Take a wild guess what I'll be running! Yeah, that's right...the two-mile...again. *Sigh* But hey, it's at Chesapeake and they have a rockin' track. Maybe it'll turn out for the better. Sí? Not much is going on, really. Twenty-four days until my birthday, I think. Amanda had it on her journal that it was twenty-three days until Harry Potter comes out, so it must be twenty-four days until the big One-Five. Wow, fifteen. Ha! When Thursday gets here it will be twenty-five WORK DAYS until school lets out on the 17th of June. That's good, because I'm just plain sick of school. It took me long enough to get sick of it, but I got there. Hey. Then the HSA's are in two weeks. I get to go in late on that Monday since it's the Geometry HSA. Other than that, it's regular time all that week. Next year sounds good already. Sophomore...YES!!! AP European History, moving on up, Honors English and Honors Chemistry...it's all good. Music Theory, Latin, Spanish III, and whatever else I signed up for. It's looking good already. Can't wait. I'm so sick of this year...Theatre Arts is fun, but it's a hell of a lot more work than even any of my core classes. Team Sports just plain sucks, but I'd rather have TS than Fitness for Life, and I never had to take Fitness for Life so I guess I feel kind of lucky. All my other classes are just going downhill now. Katy's birthday is next Wednesday. Let's see, what else? Working on more music, more gee-tar. Amanda's crushed, and I don't see why. I guess she had more to lose since I didn't really count as anything but accompanament. It's all good, and I'm not worried. I once had something Something that was so good Better than the last thing I touched Then I turned right around On that something Guess I figured I didn't like it that much... Whoa yeah the grass is green But can you tell me Can you feel it? I wanna feel it! Whoa yeah the grass is green But I think I stained my jeans and now Everybody knows that I've been in it... I am a believer But as I was standing In line somebody took my place... I am a believer No matter what they say I got so tired along the way Whoa yeah the grass is green But can you tell me can you feel it? I just wanna feel it! Oh yeah the grass is green, But I've stained my jeans And now everybody knows that I've been in it! And I've got a skeleton that deeper than any closet And I promise I will ride on it... You opened up to me, 'till I could only see the Beauty in your dishonesty, yeah! Whoa yeah the grass is green But can you tell me can you feel it? I just wanna feel it! Oh yeah the grass is green, But I've stained my jeans And now everybody knows that I've been in it! *yawn* I'm so tired... Someone told me today that my birthmark looked a lot better than it used to in sixth grade. When I told them that it should because of all my surgeries, they were surprised 'cause they didn't know I'd had so many surgeries (I've lost count). I guess that's good. I'm hoping for another Thunder-Boomer so I won't have to go outside and play flag-football tomorrow in Team Sports. -Mal
The girls team kicked ass today. I got second place and eight points. McPhail was a lap ahead, but she's a great runner so I can't complain. Ahhh Auditions on Friday. I'm not really worried, because it's just for fun and if we don't make it, I wouldn't be surprised. If we do make it, that's the only time I'd get nervous. But I honestly don't think we'll get that far. It's all good. Ehhh! Shelb bought be the Punisher Soundtrack Album. Amy Lee and Seether...kick ass! There's some other hot stuff on there too. Nickelback and Trapt...Drowning Pool...awesominity. I wanted you to know, That I love the way you laugh. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain Away... I keep your photograph, And I know it serves me well. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain 'Cause I'm broken When I'm lonesome And I dont' feel right When you're gone Away... The worst is over now, And we can breathe again. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain Away... There's so much left to learn, And no one left to fight. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain... 'Cause I'm broken When I'm lonesome... And I don't feel like I am strong enough. 'Cause I'm broken When I'm lonesome. And I don't feel right When you've gone Away...
Gahhh... The carpeters are ripping up our old carpet, and they think they spakeled Charlotte into the air pipes...Shelby says we may never see the little kitty again...*sobs* Tomorrow I'm staying after all afternoon since the meet doesn't start till 6 and I don't have to be there till 5 and my parents can't give me a ride there after school. So after Bio I'm leaving and walking down Patriot Lane to go to McDonalds or 711 to hang out w/ jenn and whoever else wants to go. Talent show auditions are on Friday. 3:40. Ehhh no big. Amanda's nervous about it though, I think, and Caitlyn hasn't even finished her dance yet.
Got this from Aman, though I’m certain I’ve tried (unsuccessfully) to fill this thing out numerous times. You’re supposed to use only song lyrics or song titles and accredit the artist. Let’s see how this works! It took me an INSANE amount of time to complete. 1. Are you male or female?: “She carries on without a doubt, I wonder if she’s figured it out…” – Evan and Jaron, Crazy for this Girl 2. Describe your neighbourhood: “Never too far from the places that gather and the dreams that have been. In the safety of night, and its old neon light, it beckons to strangers that always come in. The snow it was falling, the neon was calling, the music was low, and the night, Christmas Eve. Here was the danger, that even with strangers, inside of this place, it’s easier to believe.” – TSO, Old City 3. How do you look?: “With auburn hair and tawny eyes, the kind of eyes that hypnotize me through…” – Flock of Seagulls (or, more recently, Bowling for Soup), And I Ran. 4. If you could say something to the person you like, what would it be?: “That nothings ever seems to be, when dreams collide with our reality. It should be easy when two people love each other to be free. Wouldn’t it be good if they could understand us, wouldn’t it be good if we could be together?” Fefe Dobson, Take Me Away “I am extraordinary, if you’d ever get to know me. I am extraordinary. I am just your ordinary average every day singing psycho.” Liz Phair, Extraordinary 5. Where do you wish you were right now?: (There are so many places I’d rather be right now!) “You'll remember me when the west wind moves, upon the fields of barley. You forget the sun in his jealous sky, as we walk in fields of gold.” – Sting, Fields of Gold. “In the middle of a forest there’s a clearing by the stream…” Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Prince of Peace. 6. What would you say to your best friend?: “It’s always hard to believe in your own self, and easier to find belief for a friend. I’ll hope for you, you for me, and together we can say it’ll be okay.” Superchick, It’ll Be Okay “We’re not done yet, not going quietly into the night. Not me and my friends. We’re not done yet. Don’t take it too seriously. It’s just life, we’ll win in the end.” – SC, Not Done Yet “I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend. You could cut ties with all the lies you’ve been living in. And if you do not want to see me again, I would understand.” Third Eye Blind, Jumper. (Just one more, I promise) “Just when you thought you were falling. But you know, I’ll always be right there…” – Michelle Branch, Always Be There 7. Any words of wisdom?: “All of the moments that already passed, try to go back and make them last. All of the things we want each other to be, we never will be. We never will be that wonderful. That’s life.” Nelly Furtado, Try “And when you say ‘It doesn’t matter’ well it does. And all it takes is a mistake to eat your words. And when you look it’s gone, it’s too late to turn around. It’s another day facing yourself and the things that you’ve done.” Michelle Branch, Second Chances. 8. What’s your view on life?: “And I thought I’d live forever, but now I’m not so sure.” Lisa Loeb, Stay. "I live my life by the moon. If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow, and if it's full then go. But after midnight, morning will come." - Nelly Furtado, Turn Off the Light. “I’ve got it all, but I feel so deprived. I go up, I come down, and I’m emptier inside. Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I’m missing, and why can’t I let it go?…There’s gotta be more to life, than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me. ‘Cause the more that I’m tripping up thinking there must be more to life…Well there’s life, but there’s gotta be more.” – Stacie Orrico, More to Life. 9. Do you hear voices?: “Don’t waste your time on me, you’re already the voice inside my head.” –Blink 182, I Miss You. 10. If you could say something to your enemy, what would it be?: I’ve got more than one enemy…GO ME! I balance it out with the many wonderful friends I have. “You’ve called me strong, you’ve called me weak, but still your secrets I will keep. You took for granted all the times I never let you down.” Three Doors Down, Kryptonite. "Go ahead and hate your neighbor, go ahead and cheat your friend. Do it in the name of heaven, you can justify it in the end. But there won’t be any trumpets blowing come the judgment day. On the bloody morning after, one tin soldier rides away.” – Joni Mitchell, One Tin Soldier. “Bet you don’t think I can take it, but my mind and body are strong. Bet you don’t think I can make it, it won’t take long!” – Joanna Pacitti, Watch Me Shine. 11. Do you have a role model?: “Two days past eighteen, he was waiting for the bus in his army green.” – Dixie Chicks, Traveling Soldier “You could be a hero, heroes do what’s right. You can be a hero, you could save a life. You could be a hero, you could join the fight for what’s right.” – SC, Hero. “Each day she goes on is a day that she’s brave, fighting the lie that giving up is the way.” SC, Hero. 12. Do you have angst issues?: “Sometimes I have good days, and it’s great to be me. Sometimes I get the best of insecurity. And it’s quite all right to be the one and only, but some days I just feel like the one and lonely. Oh, the one and lonely.” SC, One and Only. “Makeup can’t hide how I feel inside. We all have bad hair days, those ‘nothing good about me’ days. We just keep moving on, ‘cause they’ll be gone, and we’ll still be here going on. We have our yesterdays, ‘no lunch ‘cause the jeans don’t fit’ days. We’ll still be going on.” –SC, One and Only. 13. How has music had an effect over you?: “It was the glow of a light. It was the heart of a song, it was the tear of a child who had never belonged. It was the wish of a soul on an old neon light, and the Lord smiled at him on that cold winter night. Hear the bells ring through the night. Hear as they ring through the night. Listen to the bells as they ring, listen to the message they bring. Listen to the sound as they sing as one voice in the night. Hoping that we’ll all understand every dream is there in our hand. And for every bell, let them ring on through the night!” –TSO, An Angel Returned. 14. How do you feel right now?: “And I thought that what I felt was simple, and I thought ‘Well I don’t belong.’ Now that I am leaving, oh I know that I did something wrong.” Lisa Loeb, Stay. “It really doesn’t matter if we don’t eat. And it doesn’t matter if we never sleep. No it really doesn’t matter, doesn’t really matter at all. Because we are so young now, we are so young, so young now. And when tomorrow comes we can just do it all again.” –The Corrs, So Young. 15. How do you feel towards your parents?: “Then I see you standing there, wanting more from me, and all I can do is try. Then I see you standing there, I’m all I’ll ever be, but all I can do is try.” Nelly Furtado, Try. 16. What’s your favourite part about the opposite sex (or the sex to whom you are attracted)?: “There’s something ‘bout the way you looked at me. Made me think for a moment that maybe we were meant to be. And it’s strange that things change but not my wanting you so desperately. Oh, I cannot ignore it. I hate giving in but I should have known better.” – Michelle Branch, Desperately. 17. Do you have low self esteem?: “If you wanna be somebody else, if you’re tired of fighting battles with yourself, if you wanna be somebody else, change your mind.” – Sister Hazel, Change Your Mind. 18. What’s your question to the world?: “Are we wise to believe in things we never see? Are prayers just wishes in disguise, and are these wishes being granted me? For now I see the answering to every prayer I’ve prayed! Are we kind, more this day than any other day? Or is it only in our mind? And must it leave when you have gone away? It’s different now, it’s changed somehow, and now you’re here to stay.” –TSO, This Christmas Day ----- Ouch, my hands hurt now... GOLLIDAY IS GOING TO ROCK SO HARDCORE!!! I'm running the two-mile. Marisa McPhail is, too, but I'm just gonna run my race and try my damned hardest to get up there, whether M.M. is there or not.
There is no possible way I can describe to you the beauty and wonder of my trip to Québec. It was a once in a lifetime trip and I will never forget it. I saw beauty beyond compare, intrigue beyond reasoning, and I had the most enjoyable time I've ever had. I will miss the city of Québec and the Québecois, especially Maxime, our tour guide. I will miss all of it. In fact, the only bad part about my trip was crossing the border, knowing that I was back in America and knowing that I was back in a place where all I can hear is terrible news. So, after spending a whole weekend without television and without interruption from terrible news breaks and whatnot, I have resolved to refrain from watching as much news channels as I used to and watch less television entirely. I am completely sick of the disease of fear spreading throughout America and I just want to bring back as much peace from Québec as I possibly can. "I'll miss you... Miss you so bad. I can't forget you, Oh, it's so sad. I hope you can hear me: I'll remember it clearly. The day you drifted away, Was the day I found it won't be the same!" I somehow learned that life is only what you make of it. Your president can control you country, and your news channels can bias you as far as fear and terror go, but the excitement you feel and the wonders you see only come when you want to see it and when you are willing to be captivated by the extremity of the world around you. Does that make sense?
This post is probably said out of immediate irrationality, so please do not take it seriously if it offends you terribly. So, they killed that dude...Paul Johnson (sp?)... It makes me sad, it really does, I mean, anyone who isn't sad about someone dying is weird...but... How is his killing any different than all the people Americans are killing in the Middle East? Sure, we're over there to kill terrorists, but how many innocent Iraqis have been killed? THat's a tally number I haven't heard in a while. What other difference is there besides the fact that we just aren't killing terrorists one by one and putting their killings on the internet? Besides that, how are our killings any different than theirs? I watched Joan of Arc today. After the battle for Orleans, she asks her captain (well, God), "Are those that died for England any less noble than those that fought for France?" Now, are those innocent (not necessarily terrorists) Iraqis dying any less human (not noble, per ce) than Americans dying? It is a war. Earlier in the scene between Joan and her captain the captain said that, "Even a holy war is still a war." In a post I made today I said that after 9/11 I had begun thinking that maybe, just maybe, the world really is going down the toilet. Well, kids... The toilet has flushed and been drained , taking your favorite goldfish George along for the ride , getting stuck and flooding the bathroom . "Of all the things I've believed in, I just wanna get it over with. Tears form behind my eyes, But I do not cry. Counting the days that pass me by. And I've been searching deep down in my soul, Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old. Feels like I'm starting all over again, The last three years were just pretend." Now I'm just plain tired.
I've been doing laundry and packing all day, because I know I'll be busy tonight and tomorrow before I leave on Sunday. Besides, I don't want to be frazzled and rushed into forgetting something - that always seems to happen to me. So, I'm leaving Sunday and coming back the 29th of June. Just in time for report cards...whoop... Anywho...I was looking through my files and looking through all the emails and home videos and such. I opened one file that was made shortly after 9/11 and probably sent to everyone in America for all I know. Seeing the footage and hearing the voices reminded me why I don't watch the news anymore. Eugh. Then the System of a Down video for "Boom" and whatnot...it makes me sick. It hasn't even been three years. Then I remember the movie Braveheart...wow, that movie is almost ten years old now...when William Wallace (Gibson) is talking to Robert LeBruce (sp?) and he says something like, everyone dies it's just a matter of how. And then he speaks to the Princess of Whales and says, oh, every man dies, but not every man truly lives... I love that movie. And sometimes I feel like the world is going straight down the toilet. And then other times I really don't care. Because there is nothing I can do about it. Besides, why should I worry? School is out, vacations are coming, and I'll be going to two of the safest places I could really be this summer. I'm going to a place full of guns and soldiers (Naval Academy) and to an entirely different country where people leave their doors unlocked and everything seems peaceful (Canada). Why should I worry? In any case, Shelby has left with Leslie and our mommies...I have no idea where to, though. Kendra will pick me up at 11 on Sunday morning, and we'll be ready to go. Dave will pick us up at the Academy on Thursday afternoon, and then on Friday afternoon we'll go back to school and meet all the former North School kids and go off to Canada. Then in August I'm going off to the Black Hills in South Dakota. It's going to be a great summer. Plus driving. That's always cool. Wow...it's the eighteenth of June. Alex's birthday?? ...Happy birthday...I still have pictures of us when we were living in Scotland at the Guy Fawkes parades. But then tomorrow is Joseph's birthday, and then Chris' birthday is in July and Kendra's is the third of August! YAY! Birthdays!
Ewwww I swallowed a bug while running 400s at track. That is why I am no sprinter. That is why I am the one and lonely 3200m chica. THEATRE ARTS was so easy. We only had 35 multiple choice. I did my monologue, from "Good Night Desdemona" and it went pretty well. Don't mistake me, I would never want to be an actor, but I am pretty sure I got through that part with little or no scrapes. I only asked for "Line" once, and that was pretty good compared to some of the kids. Lindsay kicked ass though on hers. Spencer did well, too. I hated the essay...it was rather silly. Spanish was a breeze. Today I had the Algebra one, which wasn't too terribly hard. I didn't like it, though. It wasn't much fun. The Biology exam was stupid. I finished so early and then we could only read or sleep, and I had no book so I snoozed and it was the most uncomfortable manner in which to sleep. I am surprised I slept at all. Tomorrow I have no morning exam, and then for second period B-day exam I have Team Sports. Shouldn't be too hard. SCHOOL IS ALMOST OVER!!! YESSSSS!
It's been a while, huh? The boys won states - the only Old Mill team to get that far and bring home a banner this year. They beat Suitland by ONE AND A HALF POINTS!! Guys, it all came down to the mile relay, the 4x4! We needed to get first and Suitland had to get third otherwise we would have lost by half a point. Just as Darnell came around the last turn, Eleanor Roosevelt came sprinting up between Darnell and the Suitland guy. We won by less than a tenth of a second. Whoo. That was incredibly exciting. So....then I was in the yearbook for Cross-Country. It was a half-page picture and it wasn't half bad. It was of me and Katharina at Blob's Park running past a Chesapeake girl. It was great...except that they called me Jessica Masters and they called Katharina Kathleen Kennedy. Grrr. Not a big deal, though. That's where I've been signing my friends' yearbooks, on that picture. Then my birthday came!!!! YAY!!!! It was loads of fun. On the 3rd of June I started going to the North County Summer Track program so I could stay in shape for next season of Cross Country. It's a lot of fun... Thursday was my last regular B-Day, which made me very happy. In Cosmetology we braided hair. I came out with a messed up french braided pig-tail on my mannekin (sp?). P.E. killed me. We did absolutely nothing. Mr. Bliss' class went outside, and all my friends are in that class. Since I didn't know anyone in my class (even though I've been in the class for the whole semester) I just sat around lookin all lonely. I was rather good at looking lonely, too. In government I got the recommendation and application for AP European History. yay! We took a test, which was easy. At lunch I sat with Courtney because I needed to talk to her desperately about the Canada trip since I don't have her number and I won't see her until then. I didn't want to miss the trip so I ate lunch w/ her...even though I was sure Amanda would get mad and Keesha would be sad (awww keesha!). And at NC track...I FINALLY SAW YURKES! If any of you know how thin Shelby is (my 60 pound twelve-year old sister), just imagine Shelby stretched out into a five-foot four inch six-teen year old! Robin Yurkes, the Broadneck, hell fire-fast sprinter is a twig! God, if I have felt fat around Shelby all my life...I felt like a monster compared to Robin. Her hips were jutting out from her waist! Like...it was disgusting almost, for her to be that thin. Just muscle (just a little...lol), skin, and tiny bones. Not a gram of fat on the chick. Then on Friday it was my last regular A day of Freshman year. In theatre arts we didn't do anything. It was stooopid. In Spanish we made a five sentence speech. Mine was stooopid. In math we went over a 500000 page review packet. It was stooopid. In Biology we went over a shorter-than-math review packet. It was stoooopid. I was invited to an attendance thing, but I didn't go. It would have been stoooopid. My bus came about a half an hour late. Boy, was that stoooopid or what? Now I'm just left with FOUR MORE DAYS OF FRESHMAN YEAR! SUMMER IS HERE!!!! Guys, I just wanted to tell you the days of my vacations so you didn't think I disappeared. If you wouldn't have noticed I was gone anyway (It happens...people forget me sometimes ;)), then ignore this message and go eat some watermelon! Sunday, June 20th - Thursday, June 24th = At the Naval Academy for the Naval Cross-Country Distance Camp! Friday June 25th - Monday, June 29th = In Canada (Quebec) with those weird kids that take French in school! July 27th - August 2nd = I'll be in the Black Hills, South Dakota, with all my psycho cousins! AHHH MARK AND BRAD!!! August 9th - August 13 = I'll be in Maryland, but helping out at the Summer Track/XC camp! YAY!! Saturday, August 14th = YESSSSSS!!! CROSS COUNTRY STARTS THIS DAY AT NINE AM! Then, sometime in early September (wow, late start, huh?), like the third, I think...it's that Thursday for sure = WE START SCHOOL! SOPHOMORIC, BABY!!! Now I'm about to go off and run with Stephanie and Kurth.

I hate being torn between two things, things that I love equally but clash with each other constantly. What I hate even more is when I am being torn between more than two things, and more like five or six things that I love but I know I can't do all of them. I can't do track and Tae Kwon Do and music and school at the same time. Obviously, I can't *not* do school. But I love running...I love being a part of a team and being important and I love being able to relax and be alone running but being on a team and working for that at the same time. I love Tae Kwon Do and the familiarity and knowing everyone and feeling like I belong and that I am good at something. I can't give up music. Simple as that. How can I choose? I can't and I hate it. If I do it wrong, I will lose something precious to me. And I'm starting to realize that if I do anything or choose anything, I will lose something precious no matter what I do. Well ever wanted something so badly, so desperately that it's tearing you apart inside? You no longer think straight and just frankly want to give up and die? I can't do this anymore.
Jovana got arrested. Her mother called the cops on her and now she is in a detention center in Rochester. Now I'm going off to track, run my cares away, come home and shower, watch the Olympic Track Trials from last night, and sleep. What a life I live. Not much else going on, really. I have absolutely nothing going on for a while. I know it is really weird, but I can't wait for school. The feeling of needing to be somewhere and the feeling of being on a track team and the feeling of independance and being out of the house just makes me feel better. I could do without the work, but being busy and having things to do and being needed on a team...I miss those things. School is a great idea in theory, but the practical application of it is just silly.
Why is it that whenever things are starting to look up and the sun is coming out, bad stuff starts happening again and it's like the world just wants to get you down? Why is everything so dysfunctional ?
You Know You’re A Track Runner When… · When you wake up at five AM every Saturday morning, thinking that there is a track meet. · When you look both ways before crossing the track. · When you have a billion safety pins for the cross-country number labels. · When you get hurt and there is no such thing as rest – just ibuprofen and ice. · When you are the only sport that runs when you’re NOT in trouble with your coach. · When you have a tan line from your watch. · When you’re in a crowded hallway and you try to figure out how and when to make a move to pass the guy in front of you. · When you give distances…in meters…to your friends. · When you run away…and you literally run away . · When you walk fast just so that someone behind you can’t catch you. · When your legs feel like jell-o and the only way to make them feel better is to run. · When you have figured out how to sleep comfortably even with a big track bag at your side. · When you know the name of every street within three miles of your school. · When you’re trying to figure out your splits for the two-mile while sitting in church. · When every Saturday of your High School career has gone down the drain. · When you threaten to hurt the soccer/football/field hockey/lacrosse teams because they have moved their stuff onto the track. · When you brag about your new running watch. · When you watch COPS just to critique the stride of those being chased, complaining and saying that, “They could have gotten away if they’d had a better stride!” · When .06 seconds is all the time in the world. · When getting drunk, to you, can only be by Gatorade. · When you start most of your sentences with, “And one time, at track camp…” · When it’s pouring outside and all the other sports have canceled their games, but you go down to the locker room anyway because you know that your meet is still on. · When the gun goes off and nothing else matters. · When the gun goes off and it scares the crap out of you…and that just makes you run harder. -- I'm suffering from boredom and school withdrawal. Not really school withdrawal...I miss my cross-country and track team. It's pathetic, really, I know.
I ran the 5k race last night. I was top 15 for girls, and I got 23:38 for just over three miles. That's better than I did last year for Cross-Country. Must be all the running. So then I stay up until 2:30AM because I just couldn't get to sleep, and I came to regret it this morning when I woke up at six to go run five miles with Kendra. Now I've just got to go to the 9AM mass for church, then I can come home and sleep through the hot hours of the day and go driving in the afternoon. I wonder where I am on the countdown for learners permit. You have to be 15 and 9 months...so I think I've got just under eight months left till I can officially get my learners permit. Driving isn't so bad, but I'd much rather run...but I don't think I could run to school... Called your name today But no one answers anymore You turned and ran away Like someone came and locked the door Paper pieces lyin' on the floor I fall to pieces now The coffee's black and My heart is sore Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor Since you left that day I've realized my mind's made up on you My heart is capsized and I dont know what I'm gonna do Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor Paper pieces on the floor and I call out to youu but you turn yes you turn away I called your name today but no one answers anymore Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor Paper pieces on the floor
I spent from 11 PM to 1 AM last night watching the Olympic Track and Field Trials. Bob Kennedy wimped out of the 10,000 (6-Mile). I watched the women's 5000semi as well, and that wasn't so bad. Between the 5k and the 10k, though, was all 100m and 200m crap. I slept through that. So then when I finally went to bed (after Kennedy left the race, consequently) I was tired as anything and slept until 11AM this morning when Kendra called me and woke me up from my nightmare about Canada. I finished the AP Modern European History packet for next year today. I'm also going to the 5k race today at Annapolis High. The girl that always used to win the two-mile during Outdoor ran the 5k last week, and she won it with a really slow time of 26:07.7. That is slow. Reaaaal slow. Maybe it is just because it is summer. I saw King Arthur with my dad and Corynne. It was pretty good...it was okay...the only reason I didn't really like it was because my two favorite characters died in the end, when they could have had two other guys that no one really liked die. Tristan died, the cool dude with the eagle, and Lancelot (Ioan, from Horatio!) died. Grrr. Not much else going on. I got a capo. YAY! It cost me 17 dollars, though...
I woke up this morning at 10:55 after spending the whole night editing and revising chapters 1-8. I had a terrible headache. I woke up, dragged myself out of bed and took my comforter up to the couch where I sat and layed all morning watching OnDemand movies. Gangs of New York and Chicago, and half of my own copy of Secret Window. I felt so sick. Then I went running with Tina again. Today was our easy day, so we only did four and a half miles. Tomorrow night my dad and I are going to go see "King Arthur". My rule is that only great movies start on days that aren't Friday. Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, Star Wars (this one wasn't so great...it was the exception), and hopefully King Arthur. I go to see Lancelot...played by Ioan something or other. He was in the A series a few years back as Horatio. YAY!

Brian and Corynne played volleyball with me while the "adults" talked...Sean and Ryan didn't really do much but stay quiet and listen to their parents talk with all the other old people. Their loss! Then Mandy came over with her baby twin siblings, Tyler and Kelsey, who played with Corynne's younger brothers and sister. So, the teenagers (except Sean and Ryan, as mentioned earlier) played volleyball and had a jolly good time. Now I'm going to go see Spiderman2 again with Corynne, because she really liked it and I was the only one who didn't mind seeing it again. I've been using the new guitar program my dad got from Jett Robb to write down the music. It's realllllyyy cooool.
Merry Christmas! Which urlLink Legendary Actress are you? I've updated again. Where having a cookout today after I go out to drive. I ran five miles this morning, even though today was going to by my "rest" day. I don't feel comfortable eating all day and not running. I don't know why. A bad habit from three seasons of constant running. The Smiths (YAY CORYNNE! LoL) and the Pinkhams are coming over, and Brian is coming with the Pinkhams. We are going to barbeque since it's nicer out than it was yesterday. Set off sparklers...YAY! Well, I don't much like my heading at all, really. I don't have time to change it since I can hear the Smiths already at our door, but I'll change it after our Fourth of July BBQ!
I used a new layout. Yay. I got bored with the other. Yesterday I ran seven miles, then went to see Spiderman2 with Brian, Corynne, and Joseph (aka...JOEY). It was okay. Ehhh. Then we went to see Brian's show, but I was exhausted from running and waking up early and Corynne was tired from donating blood earlier. Not much else going on...a rather dreary fourth of July, however. Happy 228th, America. It's a good one, isn't it?
Yay i got my block account setup, this thing seems pretty cool. i am currently in my computers class and teh damn substitute is constantly bugging me about doing the damn work. Hahahaahaha... ME!!!

... And I'm horrified. But heck, it might be fun. And I should have a blog. No. Scratch that. I DESERVE a blog. I mean, I write professionally for a living. I'm a newspaper columnist (sort of). You can read me once a month in urlLink The Bakersfield Californian daily newspaper. (And once a week in a not-so-secret column that runs without my name on it). I'm also a cartoonist. An aspiring novelist. A poet. A lounge singer (although currently I am without a band or a lounge). And a lover of all things sweet and sugary. I'm also a woman AND African American. But I come in peace ... This blog is for anyone who is nosey about my life as an entertainment reporter. That includes ex-boyfriends I don't talk to anymore. Women I'm no longer friends with and my mother in the big STL. Forwarning for the fragile: I have the tendency to curse from time to time, heck, I can even be vulgar, but I promise to keep it at a managable level. I won't be flippin' urlLink Dick Cheneys all over the place. Until then ...
Totally in love with comic urlLink K.T. Tatara . Saw him at the urlLink Joker's Wild Comedy Club's premiere July 3 on Saturday night. He was HILARIOUS. He opened for comic Quevaughn (Keith) Bryant, who runs the club with his wife. Keith had me laughing so hard that I'm still seeing a doctor about it. Loved his bit on "Beltman" -- the superhero who pulls up the pants of teenage boys and supplies them with much needed belts. The jokes go on again this Saturday at the Jungle Cafe inside the Best Western Hill House, 700 Truxtun Ave. Shows at 8 p.m. and 10:15 p.m. Tip: Make reservations. You don't want to get stuck behind a pole.
News, gossip and stuff to do ... all this week in Bakersfield * Local band urlLink Printed In Slovenia is now going by the name "Loveday." Guitarist Ben Gomez is no longer with the band and has been replaced by 21-year-old Matt Melton who last played with local band Bessemer Process. * urlLink Slim the Drifter has a new band ... The Slim the Drifter Band. They'll be playing Dagny's next week. Details on the show are forthcoming ... * urlLink Eve Ensler shut down Ashley Bretz's production of " urlLink The Vagina Monologues " in LA. The show was a hit for The Empty Space earlier this year. Bretz took a lot of risks with Ensler's signature work, adding urlLink Bob Fosse -style dancing, more women and a "Cabaret" atmosphere. Bretz said she'd been going back and forth with Ensler's people for weeks. They wanted Bretz to stick with the "no more than three women on stage at once" and "no multimedia" clauses. Bretz said she got the OK, but after a benefit show where she invited out all the Hollywood types she was told to shut it down or get sued. More on this later ... * You got two more weeks to see " urlLink Hatikvah " in Los Angeles. That's Hal Friedman's play. My predecessor Chris Page gave it good reviews and they've gotten both yeas and nays in the LA press. * "A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum" will open July 23 at urlLink Starts Theatre Restaurant . * urlLink The Spotlight Theatre's latest production "Ziggurat" is without a director. Word on the street is that he had to split due to personal issues. The assistant director will be picking up the slack. The Iraqi conflict-based play, penned by Friedman, is slated to open July 23. * LA-based band urlLink Hoobastank's sleep-eyed lead singer Doug Robb has a crush on Penelope Cruz. Nothing serious. He just likes to tell interviewers that, but I'm almost positive he has a woman. Robb and the rest of Hooba will be in town Thursday, July 15 at urlLink Stramler Park . You can read about him and my interview with urlLink Phantom Planet in Wednesday's Eye section of urlLink The Bakersfield Californian . * urlLink Monty Byrom and urlLink Mother Funk Conspiracy are doing regular gigs now at Fishlips. Friday nights. Show starts at 9 p.m. * Local purse/clothing designer urlLink Misa Misono's got hot summer stuff on her website. Go buy something. * Every Friday night from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., fashion show at urlLink The Bistro off California Ave. Food and drink specials. Pretty girls in nice clothes. Jazz music. * In case you didn't notice, Bar Flies (next door to Downtown Records) is closed and no more, but word on the street is Shamiqster, Radio Shack Rahim (that's Beaux Mingus), is buying the space and turning it into a thrift shop. * Local band urlLink Near Miss Mallet is having their CD release party July 17 at Borders. Chris Page used to be the bass player before he ran away to Arizona to do theatre reviews. That's all for now! Have a good weekend!
Going to see "Cabaret" tonight at urlLink The Empty Space . I'm hoping it'll be fun. I mean, how often is "Cabaret" going to show up in town? Like never. I'm bringing my sister the theater major along and a co-worker. Beforehand Bob Kempf at the Space emailed me to let me know that they've finally got new chairs. Praise the Lord. I thought they were trying to kill me, running neck and neck with The Spotlight for worst chairs. I'm glad that I'm judging the performances and not the seating otherwise I'd never have a nice thing to say. A matter of fact all the theaters in this town have awful chairs with the exception of ... goodness. Stars maybe? Anyway, here's what Bob had to say about those chairs: "After 18 months of almost torturing our tolerant audience members, those horrid brown chairs are out of here! They have been replaced by chairs that are roomy, comfy, and with excellent lumbar support. The chairs were generously donated to the Empty Space by Bakersfield's local State Farm Insurance Offices at 900 Old River Road." Anyway. Here's an awful chair ranking (not including the Space's new chairs. They might leave the list all together after tonight): 5. The Harvey Auditorium: Just like high school, now with spinal injuries. 4. Stars Theatre Restaurant/Candlelight Dinner Theatre: At least you have a table there to lean on. 3. Bakersfield Community Theatre: Number of times I've bruised a knee in their theater due to the chairs — 3 2. The Spotlight Theatre: After nearly three hours of watching their production of "On the Verge" I couldn't tell which I disliked more, the word-heavy dialog or the chair. Hmmm. I think it was the chair. And lastly ... 1. The Empty Space's Brown Back Breakers: The staple of cheap wedding receptions and out-of-town hotel conferences, these chairs were only meant brief, brief, brief moments of sitting. Not sitting through "Julius Caesar." Good riddance, you bastions of evil. I mean, if you have bad chairs, people are more likely to stay awake and watch your performance, but then, they're also more likely to walk out after 15 minutes, so hooray for new chairs!
Check out Friday's urlLink Eye on Entertainment where I got to kick it with "The Shoopster" Bakersfield's urlLink 29 Eyewitness News Anchor Rusty Shoop. Rusty was a good sport for the feature I did on news anchors in light of our " urlLink Anchorman: the Legend of Ron Burgundy " movie coverage. Although I give The Shoopster the Ron Burgundy treatment in the piece, the guy who actually kept telling me over and over again that he was the resident "Ron Burgundy" at KBAK was the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news anchor Kurt Rivera. We had a great little moment involving him forgetting his make up for the 6 p.m. broadcast with Lynda Halligan. Here's what got cut from the piece: During a commercial break, news anchor Kurt Rivera keeps referring to himself as “Ron Burgundy.” He asks a co-worker to get a bottle out and fill it with water. “The one in my black bag,” he says, the same bag he tossed open earlier frantically to get out his makeup before rushing onto KBAK’s 29 Eyewitness News set next to his co-anchor Lynda Halligan. “As Ron Burgundy I have the authority to direct people,” he jokes, before adding that he would never order anyone around. “It doesn’t fly now,” he says wistfully smiling, “but back in the day!” Rivera is laughing now, but he'd just barely adverted a crisis. It was almost 15 minutes to air time and the anchorman was in the newsroom, but his makeup was not. For most men, this would not be an issue, as most men don’t have makeup kits. But then most men don’t have to anchor the 6 and 11 p.m. broadcasts. It’s the high definition broadcast that concerns 39-year-old Rivera the most. Ever since the station switched over to broadcasting in high-definition TV he’s had to make sure that he’s made up and ready to go every time. Though his olive skin is actually quite lovely, lightly freckled and smooth in person, the camera will find every pore, every freckle, every line and turn his angular face into a sharply detailed topography map. He’s got to have his makeup and the clock is winding down. “He made it,” Rivera shouts while in a mad dash back to his desk, bag in one hand, script in the other. Two pages of it go flying. He quickly dumps out his foundation, make-up sponge and brush on the floor. In a flash he is sitting next to Halligan, slapping on his make-up, just barely beating the clock. “My wife always nags me. She can tell when I didn’t have time to put my makeup on. She’s my makeup critic,” said Rivera after the broadcast. “But the mirrors are so small. It’s all dusty and stuff. I probably could do a better job putting it on. You don’t grow up learning how to do makeup when you’re a guy.” Rivera then smiled and said gruffly, “I’m a man’s man.” Bonus: In further evidence of that whole six degrees of seperation thing. Lynda Halligan (back in her entertainment industry days) came THIS CLOSE to being a stand-in for "Anchorman" star Christina Applegate when the actress was on Fox's "Married With Children." She lost the job to a chick who looked just like her.
Today I just realized that someone swiped out my desk chair and replaced it with a medieval (sic) torture device, a lopsided nightmare that was almost identical to my former chair. Now I'm in this stumpy blue contraption, but at least I'm not going to develop that hunchback. I'll be so happy when we move back to our remodeled newsroom. They say the chairs will be magical there. I look forward to that day.
As some of you may be well aware, I am the middle child of two sisters, neither are internet nerds. For them, cyberspace is this thing where you order cheap plane tickets, e-mail people and play solitaire. Deidre, my younger sister, is much more internet savvy as at least she's got her own thing going on at Blackplanet.com and used to be an avid chat room chatter before she got bored of the whole thing.But my big sis Denise, despite her engineering creditials, is all "Commodore 64" when it comes to the internet. Peep her following email to me over "Danielle Belton Online." Denise: "I saw your webpage...are you the only one that posts anything on it??? And what is a BLOG?? Or is it just the name of the domain that holds your web site? It is such a pink website. I didn't know you really like pink. You know I would have picked a different color. But it was cool....I think is it is...as in Daddy's word....neat! How long did it take for you to set it up? I am SOOO web illiterate." I shot her back an email and got her hip to the game. Now she's all chilly on the subject.
It's inevitable. All the Eye Street and newsroom reporters have to take turns working the weekend reporting shifts (for that news that takes place Saturday thru Sunday.) It's unpleasant, but someone has to do it. This Saturday morning is my Saturday morning to bite the bullet and suffer through, hoping that nothing burns down, no one drowns and no one gets shot on my watch because, Lord knows, I don't want to write about it. Although I enjoy covering breaking news from time-to-time I could never be a full-on police reporter. (Although I enjoy being friends with the police reporter — they always have the BEST stories.) But writing about car accidents and crimes get depressing. Next thing you know you're having anxiety attacks every time you drive on the highway and you've got 15 locks on your door. Of course, I'm only speaking for myself, but crime reporting makes me want to scream at people. Scream things like "STOP BEATING YOUR KIDS!" and "PUT ON YOUR FRICKIN' SEAT BELT!" Or "PUT DOWN THAT CRACK PIPE!" But alas, you can't make people stop injuring themselves and others
urlLink From my comic strip, "Nerd Girl." A comic about my alter-ego Maddie, her best friend and my other alter-ego Rebecca (left) and their friends, ex-boyfriends, co-workersand families.This panel features my oldest character, Jenitta Brown(right). I created Jenitta when I was in high school. She's the quintessential hot black girl with a nasty attitude. She tells it like it T-I-IS , while still being intelligent and sophisticated (somewhat.)Back in the day, Jenitta used to be obsessed with her ex-boyfriend, the star of my high school comic strip " urlLink Hazelwood Central ," DeVante Jones. Now she's the know-it-all roommate of Maddie. Maybe I'll post some of my old high school strips (they're easier to scan in than the new ones which are huge. But I'm saving up to buy a new computer to strickly handle my illustrating work. urlLink
* Disney's " urlLink Beauty and the Beast -- the musical " is coming to Bakersfield. urlLink Bakersfield Music Theatre has got the rights to perform this version of the classic fairytale this fall. It'll be playing at the Harvey Auditorium in October. " urlLink Angels in America " is also coming to Bakersfield too. The controversial, avant garde drama will be playing urlLink The Empty Space with Hal Friedman directing. Read about this and all the shows coming to town this fall in next Friday's Eye on Entertainment inside urlLink The Californian . * Purple Rain! Puuuuuurple Rain! urlLink Prince is coming to the Save Mart Center in Fresno, CA Sept. 4. Tickets go on sale tomorrow at 10 a.m. Check with the urlLink Ticketmaster . Of course, I'm a member of Prince's NPG Music Club, so I ordered my tickets through his website this morning, but hey, it's only a little over $20 to join and you get all the whacky Prince action you want. It's the only way for a complete Prince freak like me to live. * urlLink Streetrock is coming to the urlLink Kern County Fairgrounds next weekend. That's right. That's break dancing, DJ wars, turntablists, B-boys n' girls, MC's, dance crews, hip hop, you don't stop. Action goes down on Saturday, July 24. Doors open at 6 p.m. The event features $300 cash prizes and is being put on by the same people who hosted Visalia's Streetrock competition last year. (Which BTW had the world's coolest flyer -- a pic of a bunch of old Star Wars toys standing around in a circle watching a toy breakdance. Once I scan it in, I'll post it on this page.) It's $5 to get in. Call (661) 869-1508 for more info. * Wanna do something this weekend? urlLink Lanny Ray and the Reels are playing Fishlips Saturday night. Comedy at urlLink Joker's Wild Comedy Club inside the Best Western Hill House on Saturday as well.
... It's 95 degrees and people go, "God, it's nice out today."
urlLink Meee-ow . Is it just me or do the trailers make this thing look like it is the worst ... movie ... ever??? I want to back the Berry, honestly I do. But this is getting ridiculous. The bargain basement urlLink Eartha Kitt thing just isn't working for moi.
At home Blogspot looks perfect on my PC but at work, on my iMac, it looks like crap. I wonder how I can fix that? Of course, I'm not going to open this sucker up with Netscape. My iMac hates Netscape, although I'm almost positive this would work better in a Netscape browser. Oh, well. The mysteries of Bill Gates' Internet Explorer and Steve Jobs' Apple confound me again. It's like the urlLink Bobby and Whitney of computer programming.
vespertine: adj. 1. Of, relating to, or occurring in the evening. 2. Botany Opening or blooming in the evening. 3. Zoology Becoming active in the evening, as bats and owls; crepuscular. I was looking for the right word to describe urlLink Cyndi Lauper's midnight meditation on "The Great American Songbook," AKA her lastest album "At Last," which has an almost etherial quality to it. (But the Lauper is an 'etherial quality' herself.) Then the word "vespertine" popped in my head for no apparent reason. Other than knowing it was the title of a urlLink Bjork album, I decided to look the word up and learned that it was more than apt to describing Lauper's blosoming evening vocals. BTW: Hands down, Cyndi Lauper is the coolest person I've had a phone chat with. She's right up there with Merle Haggard and Dave Attel, as my two coolest interviews.
Saw urlLink The Empty Space's latest " urlLink Cabaret " this weekend. Interesting show. Really makes me wonder what The Empty Space could do if they just had more ... space. I just knew someone was going to catch a three-inch heel upside the head during the high-energy dance routines. Doug Cheesman (SubUrbia, A Few Good Men) plays the Emcee and he's amazing as usual. I've never seen him have an off night. He always seems to fully commit himself to his roles with abandon. It's really refreshing. Check urlLink The Bakersfield Californian's Eye on Entertainment this Friday for my full review. Oh, and the new seats, better. But I still crave a place that will someday invest in a chair with a higher back. Perhaps someone will someday donate goo-gobs of money so all the theaters can have egronomically correct chairs. My rear prays for that day.
So many things going on this weekend. So many things to do. Of course, I won't be doing ANY OF THEM since my car died late last night. I was getting ready to go pick up my little sis Deidre from work when the car went DOA, not even starting, making a little "veet" sound as the engine didn't even start, just sort of rapidly petering out in the most curt manor possible. * With car now sick and hanging out at the repair shop I'm pouting because I'm going to miss out on urlLink Street Rock this weekend at the Kern County Fairgrounds. I love breakers. I mean, I really, REALLY, REALLY love me some b-boys. Like in a big way. I love them almost as much as I love Johnny Depp and anyone who knows me well, Johnny Depp is basically my number one obsession (next to cartoonist Aaron McGruder, Antonio Banderas andDewars peppermint ice cream.) B-boys are just wonderful people. Period. So everyone, have fun at Street Rock without me. Show a b-boy some love and tell 'em Danielle sent you. * "Ziggurat" is opening at urlLink The Spotlight this weekend. "Cabaret" is continuing at urlLink The Empty Space . So is "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" at urlLink Stars and "Dr. Dolittle" is at urlLink Bakersfield Community Theatre . Also check out The Empty Space's late night offering, a collegiate take on "The Odd Couple." * I'm planning on going to the movies this weekend, car or no car. I can't live without the movies. I want to see " urlLink Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle ." Being from the midwest, I have a fondness for those hamburgers whom most non-midwesterners would find utterly disgusting. Plus, I'm an avid supporter of minorities who are rarely represented in films. Hmmmm, when was the last time I saw a sophomoric comedy starring a Chinese American and an Indian American. Hmmm, oh yeah. Never. I saw a drama a year ago, " urlLink Better Luck Tomorrow ," which I enjoyed because lead actor urlLink Parry Shen reminded me of a young,handsome urlLink Allen Payne (star of "Jason's Lyric" and "New Jack City.") The film is essentially a mix of "Less Than Zero" meets "Juice." As for"Harold and Kumar," I first heard about itwell over a year ago through urlLink this blog . I love both ridiculous comedies and serious drama, camp and action. I'm mostly excited about this because urlLink Doogie Howser is in it. (Is it just me or is Neil Patrick Harris like a really great name for an assassin or a murderer? John Wilkes Booth. John Allen Muhammad. Lee Harvey Oswald. John Wayne Gacy. Mark David Chapman. James Earl Ray. Lee Boyd Malvo. Harris actually plays an assassin in Stephen Sondheim's musical "Assassins.") * urlLink Rotten Tomatoes is finding Pitof's "Catwoman" extra-stinky. Like kitty litter. It's opening this weekend and I hope that it will at least become camp for some people, like "Showgirls" perhaps. If not, well, I'm sure someone will enjoy the SM undertones and bad girl action. I won't. But someone. Maybe.
Rented a wreck this weekend from the nice folks at " urlLink Rent-A-Wreck ." Sweet people. Very helpful. My urlLink 2000 Mazda Protege was on the fritz and for two days I got to coast around town in a lush, ocean-liner most know as a urlLink 1997 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme . She may not be the prettiest ship in the fleet, but she made up for it with her pimp-like smooth ride. It was like gliding on air. I spent the weekend in it, tooling itaround townwith my sister riding shotgun. Meslurping a large strawberry-banana smoothie, leaning to the right while listening to urlLink 99.3 FM (because all the car had was a tape deck). And they were playing urlLink War , which you folks play a lot here in California. I mean, in St. Louis you will never hear a song by War, but here we were, cruising downGolden State Highwaylistening to " urlLink The World Is A Ghetto ." (Which is actually my favorite War song. Very apt criticism of urban life and the depression that comes with it.) I felt very much like a pimp, but not in the objectification/subjucation of women variety. More like that bland, all-encompassing hip hop version that took the once dirty word and sanitized it for mass consumption. The Rent-A-Wreck mobile was so great, that I was actually sad to turn it in for my perpetually messy Mazda, which had the faint smell of cat pee. After all, the Cutlass, despite being a total grandma car, smelled lovely and was all clean and pleasant, not funky with the odor of living. So I spent an hour Monday afternoon at the "cop" car wash on 24th Street getting my car detailed. My sister and I discussed the play she's working on ( urlLink Spotlight's "Ziggurat"),real estateads that feature cartoons of homes as opposed to pictures of the actual site and the large number of police officers, sheriff's deputies, CHP patrolmen and government officials were there getting their cars clean. Even district attorney urlLink Ed urlLink Jagels was there getting his car cleaned (and his shoes shined.) I don't really know the man. After all, we travel in entirely different circles -- me with my local bands and thespians and him prosecuting criminal suspects. So now my car's undeniably shiny and clean and that's great. It smells all car shampoo fresh and it looks like they got up the remaining glass from that time my windows got broken out. It's all good I guess. But I still sort of, kind of, miss the Cutlass. You can't really be a pimp in a Protege, unless it's a tricked out Protege, which looks like a bastardized tricked out urlLink Honda Civic when you trick it out. I mean, if I'm going to be all chilly I can't do the thing wrong. Oh well, guess I'm settling for being square.
Bakersfield's patron saint, urlLink Buck Owens is turning 75 this year. His birthday party is going down next Tuesday at the Crystal Palace with Dwight Yoakam, Lee Ann Womack, Raul Malo and even John McCrae of Cake! Chris and Herb will be there. Heck, even I'm going to be there (as a member of the press, of course.) You can read all about it, and the people who are performing in today's Eye on Entertainment in urlLink The Californian .
Big Willie Will with the Uplift Comedy Club is threatening to help me find a husband if I show up at the show Wednesday night. Although I'm considering dating again, many of you already know how disasterous that has been for me. Since Sgt. Kabukiman and I parted ways three years ago I haven't had much interest in finding yet ANOTHER husband. I tried being married and, God, it was horrible. But I digress ... Willie Will might be able to find YOU a husband if you go to the Uplift Comedy Club at the DoubleTree tomorrow night. It's a great show. Lots of fun and Willie Will is a cool cat. A Q-Dog (Woof! Woof!) and a guy who puts together comedy shows for charity. And how cool is that? Go, have fun. Find yourself a man. I'll go find myself a martini.
Stuff going on in local theater -- Jon C. Johannsen has been replaced by Jason McLain in the Stars Theatre Restaurant's production of "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." Johannsen apparently fell and seriously injured his knee and is now under doctor's orders not to appear as Pseudolus in the Stephen Sondheim play. McLain stepped into the role with on six hours notice and apparently wowed the Sunday mantinee performance ... Brian Sivesind is leaving the theater he founded to go to get his masters of fine arts in directing and the University of California, Irvine. Sivesind will remain on The Empty Space's board, but day-to-day operations will be handled by Bob Kempf ... ... and Brian L. Lyons is leaving Bakersfield Music Theater to take a job with Kern Schools Federal Credit Union. Lyons was BMT's marketing director. He said he will still be doing some work for BMT, but only on a volunteer basis ... ... The controversial "Angels in America" is opening this weekend at the Empty Space (706 Oak St.) The opening show will be a benefit for a local HIV/AIDS organization.
I should have a new column coming out next Monday. I go on a rant about summer television programming. In it I name two of my horrible reality show suggestions. I have a knack for coming up with horrible reality shows, you know, since the bar's been lowered to hell-fire levels. Like, I'm afraid of just going into spontaneous combustion for thinking about these. But here they are, my top ten horrible reality show ideas: 10. Drag Queen Idol: RuPaul, Mario Cantone, Margaret Cho and show host Lorenzo Lamas grill tall men in heels trying to belt out standards with the flare of Barbara Wah-wah and Diana Ross. The winner gets to headline his own show on the Las Vegas strip. 9. My Big Fat Funeral: Man fakes his own death in a firy car crash. If he can plan his death well enough, and convince friends and family that he's really bit the big one, he'll win $5 million that he'll get to share with his duped peeps. Imagine the drama and surprise when Jimmy pops out of that coffin on the day of the funeral! 8. Extreme Racial Makeover: White folks become black, black folks become white, hispanics become Chinese, living a day in the life as a different race. Imagine the hilarity when the newly-white Tyronne goes to his first Civil War Reinactment battle as a member of the Confederacy! Hilarity! 7. OZ — The Reality Show: Is prison really like HBO's "OZ?" Well, 15 civilians get to find out when they're sent undercover into an actual, maximum security prison. Filmed in the Lerdo correctional facility, these innconcent folks will get the real prison experience, living as inmates and trying to convince the other crooks that they're the real deal. Each fake prisoner will be given a story as to why they got in jail (i.e. "Killed a man in Reno just to watch him die" or "tax fraud"). Then we watch to see who will survive! Every week a panel votes to see if "our" criminals will be released on parole or sentenced to another week in Lerdo's "OZ." 6. Super-Size Me: Ten slightly overweight people rush to pack on the pounds to win a free gastric bypass surgery. Watch them gorge! See how lazy they can be! 5. Get Me Out of Iraq, I'm a Celebrity: Todd Bridges, Lorenzo Lamas, Michael Bolton, Rosie O'Donnell, Kathy Griffin, LaToya Jackson, Emmanuel Lewis, Kathy Ireland, Pauly Shore and Vanilla Ice try to outwit, outlast and outplay while dodging bullets and car bombs in Fallujah. Through various challenges celebrities win things they need to survive in war torn Iraq: flack jackets, bullets and dry food rations. 4. Buy Me A Bride: Creepy American and European men bid on improvished and exploited women from southeast Asia and countries from the former Soviet Union! What will these men do to win their own Thai or Soviet block bride? Cover themselves in leeches? Learn how to speak Cantonese? 3. Grand Theft Auto: Take the America's Funniest Home Videos and Cops and what do you have? Criminals filming their own criminal activites and mailing it into "GTA — The Reality Show." Gun-totting hoodlums document their mayhem and carjacking for the amusement of our studio audience. Watch for the season finale when rival gangs compete to win "most violent" and "most likely to get caught" awards. 2. The Slave Life: What happens when a bunch of gangster rappers lose their cell phones, sky pagers, fly cars, groupies and bling-bling and are sent down south to work on a hot, cotton plantation? P. Diddy and Nelly star in this hilarious look at that "perculiar institution" called slavery. Will they survive Bobo and Mr. Charlie or will they go home crying for their Bentley's and Hummers? 1. The Slave Life 2: We "flip the script" this time, sending rich white folks to toil and sing old Negro spirituals while a poor black family gets the chance of a life time to live as wealthy plantation owners. What will happen they order their once rich n' famous help to make dinner for their family and get the tabacco crop in on time? Starring the Hilton sisters, Paris and Nikki, Justin Timberlake, Eminem and Trent Lott as the slaves.
Whew. Took a week off there last week. Boy did I need it. I was tired. All wiggin' out. Buggin'. So I spent my last week hanging with my baby sis before she returned to St. Louis. I put her on the plane today. Hope she makes it there all right. I already miss her. Who am I going to drag out to lunch? Who will I drive around town? Who will listen to me whine and moan? Who? WHO???
Saw " urlLink Angels In America " at urlLink The Empty Space . An elderly couple walked out because they thought it was a Juedo-Christian play about angels. You know ... as opposed to the controversial, passionate polemic about Reagan, Mormoms, the 80s, homosexuals (closeted and out) and the AIDS crisis. They walked out after Brian Sivesind (as Roy Cohn) shouted out "GD" for about the 400th time in less than 30 seconds in the opening scene. But if you have been following the saga of Tony Kushner's mind-blowing play, you might want to check it out. See what Bakersfield has done with it and such and so forth. Of course I'll have a review out in Friday's urlLink Californian .
This can't be all there is? I'm stuck in this pedestrian existence, doomed to live out my days in the most mundane of manners. Then again, I'm living a whole lot better than someone did even just a hundred years ago. Sometimes insight is a wonderful thing.
Today was the first day of Rock and Roll Summer. To kick things off, I am going to see Aerosmith and Cheap Trick this Saturday. I have a bunch more shows planned for the summer to include great bands from my high school years. Bands like KISS, The Tubes, and Steve Miller are already scheduled. There may be more to follow! It looks like it's going to be a rock and roll summer!
Chapter IV: A New Hope Wait....that's already been done. I hate Mondays.
*******************Where's MY G-mail invitation?*****************
Remember Devo? They said we are "de-evolutionizing." It's true. Think about it for a while. Think of the hundreds of thousands of people who should have died because they can't take care of themselves. There's thousands that should die from disease and illness but we save them. Of course, there's the people who are too STUPID to live. We allow these people to continue spreading their genes throughout the population. Instead of the species becoming stronger by allowing natural selection to propogate the genes that allow us to survive, we are making the species weaker by keeping the bad genes moving right along, diluting the gene pool and making us a less survivable species. In other words, instead of humankind improving (and I'm not talking technology here), we are reversing any natural trend for bettering our natural survival. Maybe you could look at our use of medicine, technology, and welfare as our "natural" way of keeping the species moving right along the evolutionary path, but what happens when the lights go out tomorrow and we are back to surviving off the land? I'll bet we decide it's time to cut the rope and quit dragging the "less fortunate" along with us. When there's enough food in the lifeboat for two people and there's three on board, something's gotta give. Of course the stupid and/or weak one is going over the side. ......we are Devo!
It's the oddest thing....the seven key on my keyboard just quit working. Just one little key but often the key to some password, account number, or address....a phone number, zip code, or payment amount. Ever cut yourself in an odd place. Then did you notice how often you hit or used this place that you cut, causing pain? Seems pretty frequent, doesn't it. That's like my seven key.
urlLink Here is a really great resource on PHP unit testing - apparently SimpleTest handles a bunch of the things that I was groping with HttpUnit for.
urlLink here is a good article of JMeter I found.
I wasnt going to open up a new blog just for this, but I wanted to post a bunch of comments and ideas I have been having surrounding php and web development methodologies, more for collection of my thoughts as anything else. This will also be a collection of links that I have found useful. Right now I am reading through a bunch of books on test driven development and OO development recommended to me by urlLink John Gray , and they are quite excellent. Here are some of them : urlLink Object-Oriented Thought Process by Matt Weisfeld urlLink Test Driven Development: By Example by Kent Beck urlLink Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture by Martin Fowler urlLink Peopleware : Productive Projects and Teams, 2nd Ed. by Tom Demarco, Timothy Lister The last one is especially interesting, particularly if you are a manager of any technical kind. Also, here are a few software tools I am currently working with, or trying out : urlLink JMeter for stress testing urlLink HttpUnit for web unit testing urlLink Simple Test is a PHP unit testing / mock objects framework Lastly, for you PHP developers out there that want to take a walk on the wild side, urlLink Sitepoint.com has the best advanced PHP forum out there by far, and urlLink this post is one of the best collections of useful resources I know of. I encourage you to read each and every one of those links. It will completely change the way you code.
The next meetup is coming up pretty soon - should there be anything we agree to talk about beforehand? If people are all interested in something, maybe we could all prepare for the meetup a bit before we go, prepare questions or something. Any takers? What are we all interested in?
Just an update on some of the things I've been researching and involved in for the last few days. For one, I just bought this book : urlLink HTML Utopia: Designing Without Tables Using CSS . It looks great, I have been playing more and more with CSS, and I cant believe I didn't know about it (css) earlier. I downloaded the urlLink sample chapters , and they look like the best reference I've seen to a great resource. I am all about layers these days, and presentation from content at that level just seems so clean. If anyone has any sites that use CSS well, please post them here, so we can all reference them. urlLink SitePoint is one of the best examples, although not totally attractive. urlLink Fedora is a great example - they jumped in head first. urlLink Apple is another good one - although its only partially implemented Another thing I got in a bit of a scuffle with this week was a debate on a module that is being proposed for PEAR for Internationalization. Its a port of the urlLink MakeText perl CPAN module, which I didnt know existed, but I became totally interested in, perhaps due to my Linguistics background. Whom amoung you have had to do I18N work in PHP? Here is the urlLink proposal , tell me what you think. As an aside, here is my urlLink post to the PEAR-DEV mailing list. As another aside, if you are sneering at the mention of PEAR, urlLink here is an interesting thread on why PEAR is not quite right, on the PEAR-DEV list itself. The other thing I started looking at, stemming from some reading I did a while back on TDD book, I was wondering if anyone knows of anything like urlLink this for PHP. Its a code coverage tool, this one is for Java, to see how much of your code is covered by automated tests. I cant find anything for PHP, and was thinking of starting an exporatory project to make one. I have been looking for something interesting to get me to make a PHP .so library, and this looks like it might be a cool project - what do you all think? There is another tool I cant think of right now that changes each line in your code to see if it breaks a test. It then tells you how much of your code can be arbitrarily changed without your automated tests letting you know. If anyone can think of the name of that tool, please let me know. Lastly, I am starting to use the web testing framework in SimpleTest, so I think I might post a short example howto deal here pretty soon. I cannot more strongly encourage your use of SimpleTest.
A little more on the usability track : I just signed up to go to the urlLink Web Usability 2004 conference in San Fran on Thursday, May 6. Its about $600, but the company paid for it, and hopefully it will be really useful. I'll post my notes when I get back. Also, I found urlLink this site on usability.gov which is pretty good for shorthand usability guidelines.
Jakob Nielsen's urlLink useit.com is a very good resource on usability issues. He occassionally goes off the deep end, but for the most part he's right on. If you're using TDD for design, you'll quickly need to use mock objects. The urlLink MockObjects Wiki is a great starting point. Martin Fowler's urlLink Bliki has a lot of good information and links to other valuable blogs. It's a great place to stop by once a week or so. Be sure to follow at least a few of the links to other ThoughtWorks bloggers. We've all had to deal with the urlLink BigBallOfMud . urlLink Joel Spolsky's blog is one of the best. Spend some time reading through the archives, you'll find all kinds of goodies. Shameless plug: I occassionally post my thoughts at urlLink stupidsimple.com . You might or might not find it helpful.
Usability Links --------------------------- I am having some issues with some bad usability design, and so I have started researching usability on the web, so I can try to help come up with some good rules to basic usable web design to always adhere to. I know a bunch of stuff that I like and dont, but I know there are more objective ways to measure and evaluate that - what UI experts do and such. So, I want to come up with an idiots guide to web usability. Here are my first links to interesting material on the subject - I will just edit this post to add more links in the future. Websites urlLink Common Ground Common Ground: A Pattern Language for Human–Computer Interface Design. urlLink Interaction Patterns - This page contains information about resources related to pattern languages for interaction design (of which user interface design is a subset). urlLink Task Centered User Interface Design Books urlLink http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/020172149X/qid=1080950103/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-8238258-6554329?v=glance=books=507846">The Design of Sites : Patterns, Principles, and Processes for Crafting a Customer-Centered Web Experience
Here are some initial links of some of the things we talked about: urlLink PHP 5 Changes urlLink Xdebug urlLink Simpletest and some excellent urlLink API docs urlLink Crc Cards - class, responsibility, coordination there are also some links to many of the books we mentioned in an earlier post here.
Welcome fellow PHP meetup-ers! I went to a San Fransisco PHP meetup tonight, and talked about some of the things on this blog and more. I suggested that this blog be a central place for us all to post useful links and thoughts and such about PHP and advanced development, etc. Maybe spitball some topics for our next meetup. When you get here, please signup for a Blogger account and email urlLink me , so I can give you permissions to post. Thanks guys, I had fun! Next time I say we meet a few blocks up the street at Gordon Beirch!
Here are a couple of interesting projects aimed at PHP5 : urlLink Propel is a PHP object persistance project, like an ORM package. Havent used it yet, but it looks pretty interesting - I remember John and I played around with something similar, but it didnt work out in the end. I am interested in seeing if this one is a cleaner model. urlLink Creole is a subproject of Propel that provides a DB abstraction layer, like PEAR::DB, or my own DBI modules. It looks pretty clean, but probably should be transparent behind Propel. Also, there is nothing here yet, but the idea is pretty cool, I'm going to keep watching it : urlLink http://www.sebastian-bergmann.de/AOP/
Sorry I missed the meeting this month, but I did go to a usability conference in SF that day, so I'll post some notes about that here pretty soon. In the meantime, been playing around with PHP5, and it looks pretty cool. I'm especially interested in the new set of engine level interfaces. PHP is including some standard interfaces like Iterator in the engine, so there is a defined standard for that now. Here are a couple of links that are related to this topic. I have PHP5 running on my home machine, and I am going to try some of this out, and post a more detailed tutorial later, since I cant seem to find anything good on the internet about this right now. urlLink http://www.php.net/~sterling/adt/ urlLink http://www.php.net/spl
I havent tried this out yet, but it looks pretty cool, its a mysql benchmarker, like ab for apache. I know this is a PHP meetup, but I figure most of us use mysql anyhow. urlLink http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/super-smack/

Here I am gorging on chicken wings while I type with one hand. But Yummy those wings are goooooooooood. I woke up around 10:00 am. I got my 8 hours sleep but I have no idea why I'm still tired. Could it be depression or is that that I'm not sleeping that deep sleep especially when I'm PMSing now? I'm clueless. It's nothing new though. I've been suffering from this for years. I even have dark circles under my eyes for as long as I can remember. Maybe I'm amemic. That's probably the reason. All I need is stabilty in my lifestyle. A routine of some sort that from time to time, I'd get out of to spice up my life. At the moment, I have night time classes that make me feel uptight for some reason. I never really liked them. I'm hoping that soon though that I'll start my internship and then I'd have a rountine then. Sleeping a certain time and waking up again a certain time for a while. Another thing that's been bothering me is that I'm PMSing. A girl's nightmare along with the actualy menstral. My whole body just messes up and doesn't want to make me rest. My mood suffers to the degree I'd be ready to snap somebody's neck. It's Funny how one little thing can change a mood. As I was typing this my doorbell rang. I had no clue who could it be. I looked through the peep hole and to my surprise it was the mail man. I got sooooooo damn excited. I was waiting for this moment for a while. I finally got the package my dad sent me, at least one of them. I believe there's another one on the way. I know I might be a sap for wanting to watch this but the package was a couple of VCD for SuperStar ( The Arabic version of American Idol) Well, I used to watch it with my family when I was back and as a singer myself, it's a good thing to watch to get a good idea how to be even a better singer. Where I am right now, the show doesn't run and it's totally sad because I miss it, especially that one of the contestants looks like somebody that's sooooo close to my heart but yet far from me on the other side of the world. Well, I'm watching it while typing this. Anyways, I'm done with this, I'm going to go off watching it on my couch now. YIPPIE!!!!
So here I am writing on here for the first time so I'm pretty excited. As soon as I finished registering and am getting ready to start. I decided to turn on my lights because it's getting dark and I personally don't like to be in the dark. I even have a night light when I go to bed. Anyways, back the original story... So I turn on the lights and sat on my desk to start on this when I saw the lights flickering, I heard the electricity and the worse thing is I saw sparks from the fuse box. I almost had a heart attack. It's just funny that my cats ran to see what the heck were those sparks. Thank Goodness the fuse box is high up where they can't reach it. Anyways, I just had a heart attack thinking that my place was going to burn down. I'm glad all is fine now though... What a way to start this blogger. :)

I just tried Windows Longhorn beta 4051. I got it off of urlLink emule . It is *very* ugly. Longhorn is much more bloated than Windows XP (and I thought that was bad). Windows Explorer in Longhorn has a large XP-style menu on the left side and a completely unnecessary menu under the toolbars. Combined with the *gigantic* back and forward buttons that are permanently docked at the /very/ top of the window, this leaves very little space for the actual file view. To top it all off, the address bar is actually visible by default (was not in XP) but it looks horrific; yet it does have a semi-cool drop-down list for each directory/subdirectory. The quicklaunch, system tray, and clock now reside in their own gigantic (~5-icon width wide) toolbar on the right side of the screen. The clock is overly large. When you click on the clock a much larger clock will popup. The taskbar and new ugly sidebar take forever to load. The sidebar can be minimized, but then there is no way to see your quicklaunch, system tray, and clock.... What a shame.

Torrentz is a website that allows you to download just about anything you could want (legally or illegally) via Bitorrent. Torrentz changed their homepage for about a week to notify their visitors that they would be down due to legal issues. It appears now that Torrentz is down for good. I will now have to rely on urlLink www.suprnova.org , urlLink emule , and urlLink StreamRipper . What is piracy coming to?
I currently know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript very well. I usually end up looking up CSS commands and I have to refer to websites for some lesser-known JavaScript commands. I also know Perl and some Visual Basic commands. I can easily alter Perl scripts and I have made some of my own. I do not know Perl very fluently but I know if well enough. I only know some Visual Basic code because I have developed a few Visual Basic programs. The VB project I am most proud of is urlLink Network Message Send . I currently know bits and pieces of Unix shell script, DOS, and any other language similar to the ones I already know. I haven't been able to program and design much recently because I've been busy with school, swimming, water polo, and illness. I am going to learn Java next year in a class in high school. I am not too excited about learning Java but it is the only language they teach at my school besides Visual Basic. I believe Java will not grow online anymore. It is almost obsolete on the internet and the only place it is really used is cellphones. I self-taught myself all of the other languages I know so I am not sure how they will teach the course and if it will be easier to learn from an instructor.
This is my first post on this blog. I am not sure what I will end up putting on this blog. I'll probably just use it to share my thoughts.
urlLink Mark Lentczner recently made a urlLink Periodic Table of Perl 6 Operators . Mark's blog was Slashdotted via urlLink this article about his periodic table. I have mirrored a copy of the table on my server. The table is licensed under a urlLink Creative Commons urlLink Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 license. My mirror: urlLink PeriodicTable.pdf
urlLink GeeXBox is a Linux distro meant to be used to allow any computer to become a home entertainment system. I found out about GeeXBox when it was in its 0.9 stage. It was alright back then but it had some bugs and was a bit glitchy. GeeXBox 0.97 is out now and it is incredible! GeeXBox has TV-out support, support for common controllers, the ability to find and play any shared media on the network, an internal FTP server to allow anyone on the network to remote the file system, and support for many different media formats. Many settings in GeeXBox can be customized by Windows or Linux users by downloading the ISO generator and changing/replacing files before the ISO is re-created. I have created two Matrix-style themes for GeeXBox that can be found on urlLink GeeXdB.net . I am planning to build a shuttle box this summer that I will hook into our TV and stereo system. The video card will have to have SVIDEO support and will probably some kind of nVidia. The sound card will need to be very good. 512MB RAM should be good. GeeXBox is live-cd based so it loads itself into RAM on boot and I want to be able to cache as much of the movie I am watching as possible. The CPU does not need to be fancy; just as much as a DVD requires. The motherboard should have USB 2.0 support (I believe it is standard anyways). The motherboard does not need built-in audio or video; however a built-in NIC would be nice.
Blogger's new features and new look is awesome and everyone seems to be loving it. One thing that Blogger is still missing though is a way for users to customize their RSS feeds more. (For those of you who don't know what RSS is check out urlLink What is an RSS Feed? and urlLink Introduction to RSS ) . Users of Blogger can currently edit their website template and the HTML code in their posts but they do not have the ability to alter their RSS feed in any way. Blogger probably does this so people cannot mess up their RSS feed and render it useless. A good way for Blogger to allow editing is to allow users to add some extra select tags to their feed to allow some more flexiblity. The RSS tags are really the only thing that need editing. The reason I thought of this is because I recently licensed my blog under a urlLink Creative Commons license to allow people to re-distribute my work, make derivative works from it, and even sell my work as long as they give me credit for it and license their work under the same Creative Commons license. This allows the words I am writting here to be heard legally by means of open-source-like redistribution. Anyways, after licensing my work I found that I could put a few tags into my RSS feed and people would know, if they accessed my blog via the feed, that the work was still licensed under the Creative Commons license. I then realized that there was no way for me to edit the feed without logging into my server and manually editing it. Blogger doesn't currently allow users to edit their feeds in any way My idea for Blogger is to create a few form fields (HTML input boxes) to allow users to add the correct tags to their document to inform users about the licensing information of their feed. Each post should have its own licensing tag (which will proabably be the same for all posts). An example of the licensing tag is: cc:License rdf:about="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" The whole blog should also have some other tags in it to denote what rights the reader has. More information about denoting a creative commons license in an RSS 1.0 feed can be found at urlLink RDF Site Summary 1.0 Modules: mod_cc .
I discussed the algorithm one would use to convert decimal to binary. I decided that it would probably be easiest to start of with a simple method simlar to this: $decnum = STDIN>; # get input from the user while($decnum for ($x = 1; $x # find the largest number that where { log(x)/log(2) = W (W is a whole number) } $maxnum = $x; } $decnum -= $maxnum; # subtract the binary-based num. we have so we can loop push (@onevals, $maxnum); # store the binary-based num. for later use } $currentnum = shift(@onevals); # get the largest binary-based num. we put in storage $binarynum = "1"; # add a 1 in front (this is our starting point) for($x = 1; $x $binarynum .= "0"; } while(@onevals) { # add all the ones in the right spots $currentnum = shift(@onevals); # find the next largest binary-based number $binarynum ~= /0(0{log($currentnum - 1)})$/; # find where the next one should go $binarynum = $` . 1 . $1; # add the one in there } print "$decnum in binary is: $binarynum"; # print the result Please realize that this code was just written off the top of my head and I haven't even tried it yet. Perl is almost never bug-free for me the first time. Its the basic idea though.
if( $fed_trouble ) { print "It wasn't be"; } urlLink This Slashdot article poses the idea of opening up your wireless LAN to the world so that you can do what you like and claim it was a neighbor or a urlLink wardriver . On our home wireless firewall we have MAC address restriciton and a DHCP setup. Both of these would have to be turned off to allow outsiders (and you) to access your LAN and anonymously use it. This would allow people to ruin your bandwidth; plus I doubt the authorities would believe that you didn't know what you were doing.
I haven't posted in a while. I've been posting to p2p galore some recently. I just realized how easy it is to download episodes of CSI or one of those other investigating-type shows. I can get the newest CSI espisode recorded from an HDTV in an hour or two via bittorrent. I use urlLink SharpReader to see when my favorite (blogs news sites torrent site other RSS-supported sites) are updated. I just click on the links to the shows in SharpReader and the torrent opens right up. I use urlLink Torrents.co.uk and urlLink #TVTORRENTS to find torrents. #TVTORRENTS also has an IRC room on news://irc.efnet.org. The instructions for the IRC chat are at urlLink IronFish.org .

To re-program the game Pong you need to consider a few basic variables. The speed of the ball must be kept constant and the slope of the ball must change accordingly when a ball hits an object. The actual slope of the line that the ball is traveling in can be determined by the urlLink Pythagorean theorem : A 2 + B 2 = C 2 . A is the change in the X axis per millisecond, B is the change in the Y axis per millisecond, and C is the slope of the line. When the ball hits a flat surface the slope must change to allow the direction of the ball to change. When the ball hits a horizontal flat surface the change in Y must become negative and the change in X must stay the same. When the ball hits a vertical flat surface the change in X must become negative and the change in Y must stay constant. A more accurate game of Pong would include other variables such as a change in slope according to the velocity of the paddle at the moment that it hit the ball and where the ball hit the paddle (the edge or the center). These factors would change the velocity of the ball and would make the game more interesting, however they require much more math. The previous post was posted from my cell phone while I was at school. I text messaged an email address that can be used to post to my blog. I thought of the ideas behind the making of Pong today after my friend asked how you would go about programming a game of Pong.
I'm posting this from my cell phone. I just realized how difficult it is to make a good game of pong. There r 2Many vars. bye
I'm getting ready for a switch to Linux. This time it will be fairly permanent (I hope). I switched to Linux last winter break for about two weeks. I was using SuSE 9.0 then. I got into making urlLink FreeSoftwareReviews and I needed to use Windows to review software. I kind of got stuck in it after finding some new software and leaving my Linux distros to obsolete themselves. I'm debating about which Linux distro to use as my main system. I have a ridiculous amount of hard drives and I'm hoping to buy two more this summer. I use a urlLink Lian Li removable hard drive bay with 8 removable hard drive drawers. At the moment my hard drive status is: [Windows 2000/98 (120gb)], [Slackware 9.1 (8gb)], [Mandrake 9.2/Slackware 9.? (80gb)], [Mandrake 10 (8gb)], [SuSE 9.0 (80gb)], [Longhorn (120gb)], [no OS (300mb)], [empty drive drawer], [empty drive drawer]. I think I might try Linspire (aka Lindows), Fedora Core 2 this summer (I tried Fedora Core 1 already). I think I will be switching to either Mandrake 10, SuSE 9.1, or Slackware 9.1. I had a little crashing problem in Mandrake 10 (probably because I multi-tasked a little too much). I would love to switch to Slackware permanently but I'm not very familiar with updating my system regularly, patching it myself and such. If there was a service I could use to do this while in Slackware (or a website that recommends what to update frequently) I may give it a try. If Fedora Core 2 impresses me more than Core 1 did, I may even switch to it. Any suggestions are welcome (*hint hint*).
I changed the name of this blog to chmod 311 because I think it suites the blog and my life in general well. For those of you who have never had to change file permissions on a Unix-based system, chmod is a command that alters read/write/execute permissions of a file according to the user, group, and the rest of the world. The basic system for changing permissions is based on numbers. 1 represents read permissions, 2 represents write permissions, and 4 represents execute permissions. The basic file permissions chart: user group everyone read 1 1 1 write 2 2 3 execute 4 4 4 Most of the files I deal with, including many of the files on my harddrive can be read and written by me and can be seen by the whole world. In this way I can share many different files and allow others to use them yet keep people from changing those files on my computer. (This is how it works on most p2p clients)
urlLink sURL is an awesome new site that can make a URL very short or *very* long. It was made by an ACF member. (ACF stands for alt.comp.freeware, it is a newsgroup for discussion of freeware). Here are some of my sURLs: urlLink http://surl.co.uk/?232 , urlLink http://surl.co.uk/?233 , urlLink http://surl.co.uk/?174 , urlLink http://surl.co.uk/?268 , urlLink http://surl.co.uk/?269
I started creating a very simple JavaScript script (I know it sounds redundant) that searches the top freeware directories. So far the script can only search by opening new windows for each website. Soon there will be a feature for framed version of this searching script. The first version of the script can be found at urlLink http://www.freesoftwarereviews.com/freewaresearch10A.html .
I urlLink switched to Fedora Core 2 (Linux) a while back and I'm still using it. It seems like each time I install a new system I get more and more things to work correctly and I learn how to overcome more and more obstacles. Windows hackers/techies have to perform tasks to overcome obstacles all the time, but they are usually very different obstacles than the ones you find in Linux. I have ran into many problems so far in Linux and overcome quite a few. A few of the problems I have run into so far include: lack of Cannon i950 printer drivers installing a printer attached to another machine (Windows) on the network uncorrupting amule (emule for Linux) getting sound to work after breaking it, installing a new Window Manager (IceWM) finding various dependencies for various programs making my own shell scripts I have overcome most of these problems. I just bought Slackware 10 (it was really free with $6 shipping) and I am hopping to switch sometime soon. I need to set some goals to accomplish before I feel that I can switch. I want to be able to compile and install a new kernel, and keep up-to-date on various other software easily.
I recently noticed that since G4 and TechTV have merged many of Kevin's dark tips have been transferred but an archive for them has not been made. I started an archive of them yesterday. I used this opportunity to test out the use of very simple HTML and multiple style sheets. I used javascript to change the style sheet and save/load the user's last style sheet in their cookies. I experimented with floating DIVs, creating content before and after commands and many other cool CSS tricks. The archive is licensed under a very non-restricting Creative Commons license (as expected) and I'll change the archive if you contact me about it. Oh.... and I also made an RSS feed for it from scratch. urlLink Unofficial Dark Tips Archive
I finally switched to Linux. I installed Fedora Core 2 last friday night and I loaded all of my music, family photos, and other important documents onto Fedora by Sunday. I am using an 80gb hard drive which is sufficient for now even though I had almost a completely full 120gb one for Windows. The games and programs for Linux tend to take up less space and I don't need as many of them. I have a Microsoft Wireless Natural Multimedia keyboard. It is a nice keyboard besides the fact that it has an "F Lock" key that has to be pressed "on" before the function keys (F1 - F12) can be used. I used to use a Windows regsitry hack that fixed this by changing all of the keycodes of the new and useless functions of the F keys (like print, reply, save) to act as if they were the normal F keys. Now that I am using Linux I had to get used to pressing that dumb "F Lock" key again. I got sick of it so I made a shell script that fixes the problem. The script is available and licensed under the urlLink GPL . The script is: urlLink f_lock_fix
Microsoft officially patented the double-click. What has this world come to? An "Anonymous Coward" on Slashdot claims that the double-click was first made by aliens before Microsoft. I don't know if I would go that far, but I am sure it was used before Microsoft was ever thought of. Quoting urlLink Microsoft Receives Patent For Double-Click Could mere humans have thought up the concept of clicking twice! The summary of the patent in fluffed-up-fancy-shmancy-english terms is: Quoting urlLink United States Patent: 6,727,830 A method and system are provided for extending the functionality of application buttons on a limited resource computing device. Alternative application functions are launched based on the length of time an application button is pressed. A default function for an application is launched if the button is pressed for a short, i.e., normal, period of time. An alternative function of the application is launched if the button is pressed for a long, (e.g., at least one second), period of time. Still another function can be launched if the application button is pressed multiple times within a short period of time, e.g., double click. Ironically, the FTC is urlLink planing to examine the patent application process to avoid patent abusers and "patent trolls"
I found a urlLink Simple RSS Aggregator script made by Mark Irons. It allows you to run a perl script which fetches 1 or more rss formatted pages and displays their output. The script is very basic and can be easily modified. I modified the script to include the required libraries within the script itself. I also added a readme file and made the script a little more professional looking. Version 1.1 is available here: urlLink http://www.treyhunner.com/simple-rss-aggregator-1.1.tar.gz
About two weeks ago I made a Perl script that traps malicious bots (specifically spambots) that visit a website using the script, clutters the spambots email lists with an infinite amount of randomly generated email addresses, and blocks the bot from the web server. I am hosting the scripts on Sourceforge under the name urlLink SandTrap . I am hoping that the script will be used on at least a few servers and that some perl/CGI junkies might help touch it up a little eventually. The website for SandTrap is not functional at the moment but the layout is done. The full website will eventually be at urlLink sandtrap.sourceforge.net .
I am hosting wallpapers from my two vacations last month to San Fransisco and Catalina Island. I just made the page for the wallpapers yesterday. One of them is still a broken link and I haven't made any thumbnails for the pictures yet. I hope to make a nice little page for these wallpapers that shows a thumbnail, picture name, resolution, and picture taker. Right now the page is hosted on my 1GB Oktagone server but I hope to move it to my friend's 1GB Powweb server once he gives me all of his pictures from the trip also. urlLink Wallpapers Page

i have finally finished my webpage last night. i was up 'til 2 in the morning but i didn't mind that because i have finally finished my work and uploaded it in geocities. the address of my webpage is the same, i didn't use a new hosting site or account because i want it to be accessible and i also wan to maintain my webapge. last night when i was finishing my webpage, i downloaded this song enititled 'i swear' by the trio korean group, 'S'. i really like this song. i have watched the mv of the song last year, and i liked it at once because of its tune. i have watched it many times since then because during those times S was very popular in korea so their songs and videos are in demand. i haven't got any chance to download the song during those times because i don't know where to download it. i just started downloading korean songs this summer. so when i have seen the mv of that song again and downloading is now accesible, i have already forgotten the title of the song. so, i posted some messages in different forums assuming that someone could help me remember the title of the song. i was blessed because the people in that forum are very kind and very helpful. that's why i have managed to remember the title. after knowing its title i readily went to another forum to look for the song and luckily i have downloaded the right song. i have downloaded the full song when i have already finished my webpage. i listen to the song first before i went to bed. and the joy that the song brought me after listening to it made me sleep at once when i lie into bed. and it brought me a peace of mind... hehehe...
i was changing the channel to look for some cool shows 'til i got to channel 28, national geographic channel. i got interested to the show about dust storms so i watched it. i found out that dust stroms are natural catastrophes caused by the dusts in the deserts that are being carried by strong winds. though it forms in the desert, it still reaches the urban areas or cities. the massive dust storm affects everything it will cause damage by the dust it carries causing some desctructions to the surroundings and health of the people and animals. the dusts carry microorganisms and viruses dangerous to the health of the people. it causes some ailments like asthmas. the whole world experience this massive storms. in asia, china, japan and south korea are most likely affected by the dust storm. in china, 33% of its total land area is composed of desert that's why the country itself and its neighboring countries experience dust storms. the dusts in the chinese deserts also reaches the arctic. in africa, the largest desert is to be found, the sahara desert. the dusts in the saharan desert does not affect only the places near to it but also in europe. the dusts that are carried by winds reaches the european continent causing much damage. in 2001, britain experinced the most greatest problem caused by the dust storm in their farm industry. the livestock affected by the dust storm had to be slaughtered. it cost 6 billion pounds. in america, they also experience the tremendous storm. they are worried for some places like las vegas because it is surrounded by a desert. the desert is capable to drown the whole of las vegas with its dusts. las vegas is one of the growing cities in america. the growth of the place is reaching the desert so the authorities are taking some precautions to lessen the danger that dust storms may cause. one of the precautions they did was to wet the dry desert where the constructions were taking place. the hottest place in earth is also found in america, the death valley. the temperature there reaches 57 degrees centigrade. the hottest temperature there takes place during the month of july. a person can die there by dehydration. they say a person can only last there for 4 hours if he does not drink water because the water in the body easily dries. a person once their took a journey but he did not make it back because of dehydration and his blood thickens so the heart could not easily pump blood to the brain. the person's original weight was 165 kg, but when they took the dead body it only weighed 90 kg. some scientists took some observations about the behavior of a "dust devil" because they want to know why if this dust devil triggers a dust storm. but they have no idea if it really does. based on their observations, a dust devil is formed in a rocky surface. the heat of the sun makes surface warm. then the wind carries the dust in between the rocks. the forming dust devil continues to grow in size by sucking more dusts in between of the rocks like a vacuum. a dust devil reaches the height of a two-storey building. but still, the scientists have no idea if dust devils triggers dust storms. so the question still remains, do dust devils trigger dust storms ? -from the scientific mind of jasr =)
wow! i can't believe i have my own of this thing or let's say an online diary or blog..... hehehe. maybe i was engaged to create my own online diary beacuse i became interested of reading my friends and classmate's blog. well, i guess having this kind of thing is good because we can have something to write about our personal daily experiences, thoughts, feelings, and secrets..... hehehe. actually, i'm not super good at writing but since this is my personal online diary, it's ok to not be perfect (especially in grammar.... hehehe). anyways, it's a means of expressing what's within us so it's ok to be ourselves and to be comfortable at our skills. i guess i have said too much about having a blog. so here's my first official post...... i started my day waking up at 11:30 in the morning. i got up late today because i stayed 'til 2 in the morning doing my webage. sadly, i haven't finished it yet but i'm hoping to finish it soon. i have been wanting to have my own webpage before but i have no idea of how to do it. i'm so much happy now that i know how to because we had a html class in our computer education when i was in 4th year hs..... so, i spent my afternoon in front of the computer still doing my webpage but sadly, it's still not yet finished. after that, i log-on to the internet to check my e-mail but unluckily, i haven't got any e-mails from my friends or classmates..... so sad. then after checking my e-mail, i log-in at tsinoy.com, one of the coolest forum i have ever been too. i'm really addicted to this forum lately. i would not pass a day not posting a message since the day i first log-in there. the people there are very kind and crazy about their favorites..... hehehe. right now im active at TVXQ!, SHOWKING M SHOWMUSIC TANK, POPS IN SEOUL, SHOWBIZ EXTRA forums and other korean artists shows forum. i want to post more messages but i have no more time because it's my sister's turn using the computer..... i really hope to have my own computer so that i can have all the time i want..... hehehe..... i don't go out of the house unless we're going to the mall, church or relatives, meeting friends or going to school.....so, to relieve my boredom and to save some precious moments, i watch tv, clean the house or read a book (kapag sinisipag ako....) or hook up on the internet to chat or post some messages..... i took a bath after then..... then watched some of my fav shows in disney channel, even stevens that's so raven..... at night i watched star circle quest marina, few of my favorite shows in abs-cbn..... then we ate dinner..... and right now, i'm writing my first post in my own online diary...... so that's what happened me this day. - my usual habits..... by jasr =)
last thursday, i went to ust to get my uniforms. i was accompanied by yumi, ana francezca and arive. we met at the church patio (as usual) around 8am and i was the last to arrive. we left readily after i came. we went to apex and rith there, we took a fx going to taft. we ride a jeepney after we came going to espana. we arrived safely at ust around 9:30 am. me yumi together w/ ana and arvie went to the gym to get our pe uniforms. a very long line appeared when we arrived there. we have no choice so we also lined up. it didn't took me hours to get my uniform. i was disgruntled upon seeing my pe uniform. the design kinda irritated me because the print took almost the front area of the shirt. the shirt was color yellow by the way, and the design of the print was the thomasian buildings and the face of a tiger at the center covering up most of the design. the shorts was black and the fabric waskinda thick w/c i found very uncomfortable when i imagined myself wearing it on the sunny afternoon. yumi's uniform was kinda more likable to me because it just a plain yellow t-shirt and black jogging pants. we went afterwards to the main building to get my school uniform. i got my uniform in no time when i arrived at the room where it was delivered because only few people was there. we left ust after accomplishing our task. went to sm manila to have our lunch. we ate at dunkin' doughnuts. we didn't ate doughnuts though, the three of us (me, yumi arive) have ham cheese while ana was the only one who stick eating doughnuts. we left for home after. it was raining hard when were on our way home. we're lucky that we're already inside the jeepney when it started raining. the 4 of us were laughing inside the jeepney because we got wet inside. ana brought out her umbrella and handed it to arvie and arvie opened it inside to prevent us from getting wet. by the way we we're seated on the "bukana of the jeep" (i don't know how i'm gong to say it in english but the idea is there) to make the picture clearer. we arrived in pateros around 2 in the afternoon. i ended up in bed when i arrived home beacause i was very very tired.

i have sauccessfully burn again another cd on my own. it includes 9 kpop songs that are my all time favorite; atlantis princess-boa, i swear-s, without your love-jtl, hug-dbsg, music-bada, what is love-dana, cry-1tym, disco king-koyote monologue-buzz. i'm really addicted to these songs. it took me almost a month to dowload these songs in various korean sites. and i'm very thankful that i've succeeded. i'm still tracking down some songs that i haven't found yet and burn it again on a cd.

how am i feeling? FEELING GOOD!!! NEVER BEEN BETTER!!! - oh i'm so glad because everything is back to normal. it was just 15 mins ago when i wrote how i feel towards my friend and the situation we've got into but now i can't compare the happiness that i'm feeling because we're ok now. i didn't know that she was online all the time i was writing on how i feel. she pm so that's how i figured out that she was online. i was shocked that she pm me w/ a msg that seems nothing is wrong between us. i told her that i was really sorry about and she told me that everything was ok. that was the time that i really got off with the uncertain feeling. then i told her that if she reads the blog that i wrote, just regard it since everything was ok between us. then we chatted about it and we used the cry smiley as if we're crying!!! wahahaha!!! i really feel good now!!! thank god!!! i really couldn't affor to loose a very special friend... THE WORST FEELING EVER... - i don't know how to feel toward this friend of mine. should i also be mad or just be patient and wait for the time to calm her hatred or unpleasant feeling to me.? i think this friend of mine is mad at me because of an unpleasant situation that has happened 2 days ago. i really didn't mean it to happen. the problem was already solved because the thing that i ACCIDENTALLY and DIDN'T mean to DELETE was finally retrieved back because i really did all i can to make this friend happy. i even called at their house to say that it was already back but still i feel that this friend of mine is still not in the mood confronting me. actually i think this friend is "making iwas" to me because after logging in at ym, this friend readily logged-off that made me feel that this friend doesn't want to chat w/ me even though i was in invisible mode. to tell the truth and no offense i really don't like very sensitive people (i'm not saying that this friend im referring to is a sensitive person. i just want to say how i feel about a sensitive kind of person...) because they get easily upset in an unwanted situation. to tell frankly, i'm also a sensitive person because like what i said, i easily get upset in an UNWANTED SITUATION but i'm getting over w/ it once i feel bad in a situation that i don't like to be involved. *sighs..... i really hope that everything will be back to normal because i love this friend of mine and one of my closest.
i've been waiting for this day to come... to rain all day... actually it really didn't rain all day. it just started raining in the afternoon. the weather suddenly changes these past days. when you wake up, the heat of the sun is almost suffocating but when it rained you can't even stand to take a bath without a hot water. but when i took a bath this afternoon i didn't bother to have a hot water because i really like to refresh my self with the cold water. it rained for almost the rest of the afternoon making the temperature cooler than the usual. i watch the boxing match between pacqiao and marquez in our room because i could stay now long enough upstairs because during these past sunny days i'm almost dying because of the tremendous heat in our room during afternoons. i'm not really an avid watcher of boxing but i got interested to watch this match beacuse it's a champinoship fight between my country and mexico. manny pacquio, as all we know is a filipino and got famous since he defeated guerrero (i don't know if i spelled it correctly) also in a boxing match few months ago and his opponent, juan miguel marquez came from mexico. they both are fighting for the championship (i forgot what championship it is). they both have managed to reach the 12th round. the result of the fight based on the scores of the judges came to a tie. i was a bit happy that they are tie, no winner and no loser. i think, pacqiao should be the winner not because he's my fellowman but i saw how he did his best to win th fight. i went downstairs after watching the match. i log on to the internet to check my e-mail and as usual post some messages in tsinoy forum. i downloaded the music video of 'disco king' by koyote. i really love this kpop song. it makes me dance whenever i hear or watch the video of this song. after i have finished downloading, i went upstairs again to watch tv. that's all about me for today! anyeong!
it's kinda late to update this to my blog because my mom's 46th b-day was 2 days ago. anyways, here's what happened to me on that day. i woke up late again. i think it was 1 in the afternoon. my body feels heavy and some parts of my body is aching that's why i haven't got up when i woke up about 10 in the morning. i slept again and when i checked the time in my cell phone, it was already 1 pm. i quickly get out of bed because i don't want to spend the rest of the afternoon in bed. i go downstairs afterwards. i went first to the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth. when i got out of the bathroom, i greeted my mom happy b-day. i didn't hug or kiss her but it doesn't mean that i don't love her or care for. she knew that i'm not an emotional person. she know that i keep my feelings inside my self regarding my feelings for them. i do love them but i don't show them my affection since i became a teen-ager. i know i will say to my self in the future that i should've shown them my affection before it's too late. but i know what i'm doing and i know that they understand me. i know that being a good child to them means affection to them so as much as possible i want to be a good achild even though sometimes i'm moody. i spend the rest of the afternoon in our room cleaning. i separated the things that i'm still and gonna use and the things that i used when i was in high school. i don't want to throw them away because i might use them in college. so i put them away in the storage room. i went downstairs after cleaning. i ate lunch though it's already 4 in the afternoon. i log in to the internet to check my e-mail and to post some messages at tsinoy forum. i took a bath and went upstairs after then. i was watching star circle quest when my brother went up and told me that we're gonna eat outside because it's our mother's b-day. we went to the fort and ate at pancake house. i didn't like that much the food that i ordered. it was roast chicken, tacos and macaroni salad. i didn't like the taste of the chicken and its sauce. and the thing that i didn't like most about is that the underneath the chicken was a bread. the bread doesn't tastes good because of the sauce. it's kinda soggy. the tacos and the macaroni is quite good. then i refreshed my self with iced tea, my favorite refreshment. after eating, we decided to go to star bucks to buy some frappuccino. that's the only thing that i drink their because i'm not used to drinking hot coffee. i didn't go inside to buy. my 2 sisters accompanied my father mother instead. i sit outside while waiting for them. my brother accompanied me. he said to me that katya santos was at the other group of chairs. i look to where he is pointing out and i saw her. she's prettier and sexier in person than in tv. my father mother along with my 2 sisters came out and said that jennifer sevilla was inside but i didn't went inside to look at her. we decided to drink the frappuccino inside the car so we went off afterwards. well, that's it for one of the most special day in my life.
two nights ago, i had the cutest and dream ever. i was with aaron, one of the finalists of star circle kid quest. i really can't remember how we met but all i know is that he was with me in our house. we were at the right side of our house, a narrow alley leading to my grandma's sister's house and my mom's cousin's house. me and aaron was there and my father suddenly walk behind us and he told to aaron to get a plastic lid. i don't know what's the plastic lid for but we found a lid of a cheese planters. aaron said to me that the lid we found was a little wide but i said to him that it was ok. we went to after my dad to bring him the lid that we found. my father was heading to the pateros municipal hall. so, i said to the tricyle driver to bring us to the to the municipal hall. there was a little traffic so me and aaron got to have some time to talk. he's really cute. he was as cute as he was on tv. i was kinda happy at that moment because i'm with my favorite star circle kid questor. i like him the most because he's so cute and adorable. i hope that he would enter the magic circle of 5. back to my story, as we head to the hall, i noticed people acting strange. some people were like on a riot, others acting like a zombie!????? what is that!!!????? i also asked my self why from the moment i woke up.... by the way, that's the end of my dream because i suddenly woke up...... woaaaaaahhhhhh..... that's really a strange but cute dream. i'll never forget that.
One of the suggested topics for our blogs was, "Where did you get started with your research for this assignment? Was it hard to get going?" I'm going to start off by answering the last question. Yes, and heck yes. Here's why. I haven't been in any real situation that required any type of research since 1997. I was a very poor researcher back then. I see things do not change with time. To begin with, I have never been one to invest much time into reading, or getting to know authors, so this has been uncharted ground for me. I would try to recall what I learned of researching from HS, but I forgot all of that. And it's been such a long time. I've also never been one to put much stock into the person behind what I read, so writing an auto on a writer is definately not something I ever recall doing before. Not well, atleast. I guess I took that reader/writer relationship lesson and threw that in the trash. I stated in the DB though, that essays and written papers were the best way to retain what is learned. I suppose I have to back that comment up now. To answer the second question, my first step was to search the internet. What they say is definately true... about the internet now being the largest source of information available to one person. So true infact, that it almost makes the task of researching more difficult. When you find 10,000 different sources of information, what do you pick from? You try to pick the most important or most interesting information you can find. It's really hard to pick that up from so many sources available. So, now I'm hitting the books. Atleast I'm more limited in sources there. This should be an interest first assignment for me.
This is my very own blog.. I hope. I wasn't too thrilled to find that one of our very first assignments for this class was to write a blog, and that I had no idea what a blog was. That wasn't very reassuring. However, it was explained to me, and now I'm ready to rock and roll.
Well, I appear to have over-extended myself on my topic. Too much stuff to cover, and not enough time. Nor the will or ability. Instead, I guess I'm just going to break it down to repeat offenders, and how they are laughing at our legal system. Seriously, they are. To address the question you had earlier, I don't believe that prison space should even be an issue. If you commit a crime, you do the time. Joe Blow # 2 sees Joe Blow # 1 get his butt thrown in jail for a long time for robbery, Joe Blow # 2 suddenly has a lot more reserve about doing the same thing. In contrast, Joe Blow # 2 usually sees Joe blow # 1 make a public mockery of the legal system by either getting a reduced sentence and/or probation. Joe Blow # 2 suddenly feels pretty confident about his situation if he gets caught. It absolutely drives me insane to think that there are convicted criminals out there in the streets, because the state didn't invest enough $$ into their prisons, while at the same time spending hundreds of thousands of $$ on freaking flowers for the highways. Gosh dangit.
The topic I have decided to cover for this assignment is involving criminal justice, and how it relates to our American legal system. I believe it is a rather well shared opinion that the U.S. justice system is one of the most relaxed in the world. As a result, we live in a society that experiences a considerable amount of senseless and immoral acts of crime and violence, inconsistant with other countries of comparable population statistics. My intention is to inform the reader of these inconsistancies which I believe to be a BLARING warning sign, and to give them the information necessary to make the decision to support legislation involving stricter punishment for repeat offenders of the law, and laws that allow the prosecution of competent juvenilles.
Apparantly what this ad is trying to lead the consumer to believe is that their product will give you so unbelievably beautiful skin (and help you become really attractive) that you'll be comfortable showing it off to the world. At first I got the impression that they were trying to tell you that their soap gives you the awesome feeling that this woman seems to be experiencing, but I hope they'd give us consumers more credit then to believe that. That, and the whole "Zest Spring Burst" part of the ad is all but invisible in the ad's graphics. What you see here at first sight is an attractive model in an ad, covering her breasts in an attempt to convey to the audience that by using their product, you can be just as sexy. I don't know about that though. Obviously, we as humans aren't dumb enough to fall for that. What this ad's really doing, is getting your attention with the naked woman. Once it has your attention, it doesn't matter what you think about the product at that time, because once you hit the store, and you're looking for bath soap, Zest will be one of the brands in your mind, as you were attracted to their ad in the magazine by their naked woman. It doesn't really matter if you ever intended to purchase their product. It's a better marketing strategy then most might think. Check out Geico for example. Their commercials SUCK!! but their company name is easily remembered because of their SUCKY lame commercials. I guess in this example you gave us, they did their job of hitting their target audience. Who reads Rolling Stone? In my opinion, mostly younger men who like to see naked or half-naked women. There are also younger women who read the magazine, and they're just as likely to be grabbed by that ad as any man, as it's a very visually attention getting display.
Stereotyping is defined as: something conforming to a fixed or general pattern; especially : a standardized mental picture that is held in common by members of a group and that represents an oversimplified opinion, prejudiced attitude, or uncritical judgment In English that would translate to generalizing about a group of things or people. Is it right or wrong? Well, neither in my opinion. All this hype about how it's wrong for people to stereotype, doesn't make sense to me. Stereotypes are 99.99 of the times based off of some truth. For example, the stereotype that Koreans eat kimchi, is a stereotype. I'm Korean, my wife's Korean, and I was in Korea for 1 1/2 years while in the army, and yes.. I discovered that Korean's eat Kimchi. While it might be a precursor for racism or other forms of discrimination, we are human, and it is within our nature to stereotype. So, how can it be wrong? For example, I'm not racist, and in no way is this a racist example, but it is a statistical fact that young black males in larger cities commit more violent crime then young white males. The old famous question is, if you were walking down a street one night, and on one side was a group of young white kids, and on the other, a group of young black kids, which side would you take? Me, I wouldn't care because I'm such a bad sonuvagun, but the question is expected to be answered in the white kids' favor. Why? Because it's a survival instinct. Animals do it as part of their instinct. Those tasty zebras would cross on the side with the donkeys on it rather then the lions. Although all those lions don't want to eat them, it's more likely they'll encounter problems on their side. It's a statistical fact. If anybody tells that donkey he's being racist, they'd be nuts. On the flip side, stereotyping can also be a negative thing. For example, I've never had a problem with a group of people, black, white, yellow, or purple, but to cross the street on the other side because of a pre-conceived fear of what to expect, is quite a pity, because I have no way of knowing if the group of black kids don't happen to be some of the nicest people I would've met. With this stereotype, I'd never give them the chance to prove that to me. Being partly Korean, again using myself as an example, there's a stereotype that all the asian kids know karate or something. Growing up in school, I was constantly hearing other kids make comments that I was a karate expert or something, with the occassion sound effect directed my way. While, it might be flattering to me today to be thought of as a martial arts expert, as a kid, that wasn't very flattering, and it resulted in a distinct feeling that I was different. Which I was. But, boo hoo hoo... ho hum. I do understand that this example could be considered somewhat, if not very controversal, but I think it's a powerful example of stereotyping, and how it effects us. Sorry, world.
This Blog topic is an easy one for me. I could probably detail my entire life right here if I had the time.. which I actually do have.. now that I quit my crappy job. However, to talk about personal experiences considered outside the 'norm', you must first define what is normal. Because normality is a subjective perception, that is quite an impossible task... unless you look at social trends and behaviors as some sort of control group. That's what we thought back in High School, I'm pretty sure. Anyways. I have to admit, I'm not one to go outside the norm that often. Not in any way that the typical person on the street might notice. I was raised in an extremely conservative family, in a conservative way, conservatively. Based on that description, it seems obvious that I was the black sheep. Maybe?? Maybe not. My brother's turning out to be a screw-up from hell. He just might be my saving grace, sadly enough. If you really wanted an example of what I did that might be considered outside the norm, I would look at the time when I moved out from my parent's house at the age of 17, during the summer of my Junior and Senior years in HS. The reason I use this as my example, is because I've already described the way I was raised. I moved in with 3 other older guys I had known for a while into this big ugly college house. We were so pitifully stupid at that time, I can't believe we came out alive. At the end of that ordeal, which lasted about 7 months, I found myself in pretty bad shape. I had dropped out of HS to ... do God knows what (during my Senior year), which I guess was an equally sound reason to quit my job working at McDonalds flipping burgers. Yeah, I wound up back home in no time. To give the story a beautiful ending, I finished HS, got a haircut, and stopped sticking explosives up my nose. The McDonalds job.. never got that back unfortunately.
Possible blog entry # 1. I don't have a particular word that sets me off, it's more a group of words. If you've ever watched "Back to the Future", Marty McFly has a real problem with being call a chicken, yellow, or anything of the nature. I'm part Asian, so I have my own little set-offs. It's not so much the word, such as chink, gook.. whatever, but it's the meaning of it. For a man to call me one of those words, would put me into such a rage I would have to be shot with tranquilizers. Here's why. Although, it's just a word, which of course is rather meaningless, it's a word intended to mock someone. Call me any name in combination to the f-word, and I'll be ticked, but not insansely pissed off to the point of needing medication. By calling me a chink for example, you're now telling me that I'm weak. I'm so weak that you can call me such a degrating word and you don't think I'll do anything about it. There's a thin white line in trash talking, and that's it right there. That, and when you talk badly about someone's family... or dog... or gerbils. That's why I'm so immature. People call each other names to illicit a response. AND I RESPOND!!! It's not so much the definition of the word that sets me off. It's the fact that you crossed that line, and have now shown muuuuuuuuch disrespect. You die now! It sounded good in my head, anyways. Hmm...
As a recommended blog topic, you asked us what we think of the idea of "English only". I won't go on and repeat what's been said over and over again, by saying that the U.S. was not first inhabited by English speakers, therefore there is no basis for the notion that all American's should speak only English. But, I did say it anyways. Obviously language is a component of any culture. You don't necessarily have to speak a language to reside in any country. I believe that those who protest that anybody who can't speak English should not be allowed to live here are retarded. Scientifically speaking. It's my experience that almost every time I've heard such a statement being made, it was made by someone who was just inconvenienced by someone else's lack of English speaking skill. For example, at McDonalds. In my opinion, they made the negative remarks as a cover for their own embarassment. They were unable to communicate effectively with the cashier, and instead of feeling awkward at the situation, they poke fun at him/her instead to either get a laugh, or to appear superior. It's also part of the whole, "fear of anything different" concept that's going around. However, I'd like to add that I have seen in my experience, that we as Americans are actually doing a rather good job of acception different people into our culture, as compared to many more conservative ones. I believe the U.S. is doing it right. You don't have to speak the language to live here, but you are required to have a basic understanding of it to become a citizen. Afterall, language is part of the culture, and you are, by applying to become a citizen, accepting that culture.
these last 2 weeks of school are going to be a little lame and interesting.first of all, all my friends hate me, so i aint gonna be hanging out with them, and second of all, since julia has crazy classes, her finals are going to be some crazy shit, and shes gonna be studying like crazy. im gonna be chillin by myself for 2 weeks. ...........awesome.......... today, she was apparently sleeping because she got mad tired from that bbq (which actually just turned into a booze-fest). she slept basically all day up until about 30 mins ago. she got online, said some stuff to me and had to get off to read a full fucking book (grapes of wrath). hmmmmmm........... i have an odd feeling about this.......
now, in my mind i always immediately think of the worst possible outcome or reason or whathaveyou. i am talking, of course, about today and NOT chillin with julia. the first thing i thought of todya when she didnt get online (she ALWAYS does) and didnt answer her phone (she ALWAYS does) and didnt call me back, was that something had happened to her. the first thing i thought of was a car accident. its quite a stretch, but things happen. i started thinking about how one of her friends would come up to me, crying, telling me that she had just gotten in a crash and died. then i started thinking about going to her funeral. my mind is fucked up like that. im betting that thats nowhere near what really happened. she probably just had some other business she had forgotten about and had also forgotten her cell phone. i hope. fuck......... i dont like this at all......
yeah..... i dont think we're gonna be chillin today.........
laaaaaaame......
im calling her at 2........
still waiting...
so im waitng t home right now for julia to get home and sign online or for her to call me. we're supposed to hang out today but its already 12:15. although, she did stay the night at someones house last night and is probably really tired or not even awake yet...... i dont like this......
so im not chillin with her today after all. the bbq thing shes going to starts at 1:30 and shes staying the night, so i obviously a not going. kindof disheartening, but we are hanging out tomorrow. this i guess just gives me more time to try to think of something to do with her. whatever, i can survive another day......... oh, and last night i found out that the people i hang out with at school actually hate me and they want me to leave their little group thing (such bullshit highschool drama.....) so now i dont really have anyone to hang out with except for julia and i dont like that because i dont want to oversaturate me and hers relationship. kindof a shitty situation for me right now, but i realized that i dont really care becasue i have julia. so it looks like im chillin by myself today. and every day that im not chillin with julia. school will be fun.....
so, im not going to that bbq thing with her today. she said that its kindof turned into an all girl thing. i asked her if she actually wanted me to go and it was sooooo hard for fer to say no. whatever. we're chillin before the bbq thing. the only problem is that shes syaing that i get to decide what we do. FUCK! i cant do that! i cant make any decisions at all, especially when it comes to hanging out. normally when i chill withsomeone we dont really do much of anything. a lot of times we end up just sittin in my house not doing anything. i like that, but i dont think shed enjoy that. whatever, ill ask her and if she doesnt want to do that then ill try to think of something else. but fuckin a, man..... im just remembering her face when she smiles and i cant control myself right now............ oh god, im so head over heels, although she is too, so whatever..........fucking jesus.........she is so beautiful. the other night we had a pretty heavy conversation about what pace at which we're taking this. she is completely new to this, like i am basically her first boyfriend, so you can understand when she says she wants to go slow. she is also very jumpy and nervous i guess, along with not being a very "touching" person. the most weve ever really touched was when she hugged me for telling her something "really" sweet ("im not just happy that i have a girlfriend, im REALLY happy that youre my girlfriend") and when i kindof give her little pats like on the back, nothing hard just really soft little pats (she says she thinks thats really cute). this kindof causes a problem, because when im with her i just get the urge to grab her and just fucking hold her. im sure someone out there knows what i mean... but fuck, i love how it is right now sooooooooooooo much, but sometimes i just feel like i should be holding her, i just get the urge to be even closer to her and for some reason thats the first thing that pops into my head......... i just want to fucking hold her............ whatever, itll come (i hope...) and when it does itll be fucking great. god shes so fucking beautiful.............i cant fully express it........................
your blessed eyes light the path to true happiness....
anyone who has read any of my blogs on here must think im totally in love with this girl. to tell the truth, this is the most monumental, important, and kickass part of my life to date, so you can see how id get all wrapped up in it. ive said it before, but ill say it again: i am sooo happy with this. she is too. we match ungodly well, and i dont know, im just so fucking happy. this is by far the happiest ive ever been. so any of you that think that im lame or something for writing about her so much, thats why.
yeah, so i saw the day after tomorrow with julia today. not too great of a movie. i didnt mind though (i was chillin with her).my master plan, howerev, was foiled. like ive said earlier, i was planning on holding her hand today (laugh it up motherfuckers.....) but like i said, its "that time of month" again for her right now and she said that if she has her hands in her pockets the whole time to take it as not too great of a sign. well, they werent in her pockets, but rather crossed in front of her chest. i wasnt going to reach over and just grab one of her hands; that would not go well. so i just chilled and waited, but my moment never came. but i am chillin with her at some bbq thing on sunday. i WILL, and repeat WILL, hold her hand then. i will not sit by and just let that shit never happen. i dont give a fuck. im doing it.
apparently its her period this week. i dont want to do anything to piss her off since she is so prone to be anyway. but she is so sweet: she felt sh eneeded to warn me about it. she said that this week is her "angry/get annoyed really easily" week and that i shouldnt take anything she says to heart. im actually going to day after tomorrow with her tomorrow. gonna move in for the hand. only semi-nervous though. apparently shes been mentally preparing herself for it. thats so cute. im also going to a picnic/bbq with her on sunday. should be fun although i wa kinda hoping that just me and her could hang out on sunday, but like i said before, im happy just to be doing anything with her. im swooning so hard......
im talking to her right now. fuck. im so happy. apparently im seeing shrek 2 with her. im cool with it. as long as im chillin with her im cool with anything.
oh my god. she is so sweet. shes working today right after school (3:30-8:30) and she just came home to sign on to say hi to me. that is the sweetest thing anyone has ever done. it really reestablishes (to me) that she actually likes me too. in the past relationships of mine have been pretty one-sided; i.e. i really like the chick and the chick either likes me a very little bit or not at all. this is so great becasue we feel the same about eachother. fuckin shit. im so dam happy.........
well isnt this ironic. yesterday julia got mad sick and said she wouldn be going to school or working today. so i was like "aiight, the wait will make it only that much better (talking of course of holding hands)" so overnight i managed to get mad sick, well only halfway. i wanted to stay home for 2 reasons: get better, and to talk to her while shes at home sick. so here i am, sick at home. i was talking to her about a half an hour ago and this is what she said: "yeah, i feel much better and im going to school and work later tonight". BAM! what the fuck is that? the only reason im pissed is because i had a feeling this would happen. i had a feeling that id get sick overnight and shed get better and the only reason that we couldnt chill was because i was sick. and here it is......... what the hell.......... i guess though, there is a brighter side to all this: the wait will make seeing her that much better. plus we're chilli on saturday AND sunday. we're going to a bbq (hopefully) on sunday at a mutual friends house. i dont know. im still mad happy even though i am sick and am not going to see her for like a day or so. fuck.....i sound so lovesick. i think that being with her is so great (even though its only been a wee and 3 days, 2 weeks on sunday) because we understand eachother so well. we both worry about the same dumb things that we dont have to and its just so "cute" how well we work together. this is by far the best relationship ive ever had. im so fucking happy........... and on an un-julia related note: apparently a great aunt of mine is dying. i dont even know her but my mom is pretty shook up about it. shes going to see her on thursday and coming home sunday. i feel really bad for her.
shes online right now but away. i signed on right as she put her away message up. fuck.
the only time we really ever talk outside of school is when we're online. she aint on right now, so i have nothing to do. i still have to kill 21 hours. goddamit.
chilled with julia at lunch today but then got really fucked up somehow. i got all tired and i felt like i was gonna pass out. lame shit. whatever, hanging out with her tomorrow at wednesday night market, gonna hold her hand, youve heard it all...... still happy as hell......
im chillin with my girlfriend on wednesday at our local wednesday night market. the market itself is REALLY REALLY lame, but shes working that night on the same street as the market, so im going to chill with her at her work. this is gonna sound lame to anyone reading, but we're taking this REALLY REALYY slow. weve hugged once, and (im gonna sound lame as hell saying this but...) im going to hold her hand on wednesday. we're both really take-things-slowly people. but im happy as hell, and im also really happy that this one isnt consuming me (my past girlfriends/relationships had taken control of my life, all i ever did was worry about fucking up or if shes pissed or if im gonna get fucked over.......not a pretty sight) yeah, as ive mentioned before, im incredibly happy. this rules. the other night when i chilled with her for 9 hours, i: got home, got a bowl of cereal, went into my room, put the postal service cd on, turned the lights off, and just thought about the day while eating my cereal. thats so damn emo. im emo. but im happy. so it fuckin rules. god im happy........
update: last night i realized that i wasnt happy because i had a girlfriend, but that i was REALLY happy that SHE'S my girlfriend. i think that made her feel really ood about herself. i love making her feel good about herself....... goddam, im so happy
yesterday i chilled with my girlfriend julia for nearly 9 hours. it was fuckin awesome. i love spending time with her. i think the only reason i made this blog thing was so i can have somewhere to spill my guts everyday, and thats really all going to be about julia. weve been together for one week, but i dont know, its the best ever. i cant quite describe the emotion im feeling right now, but it is beyond happiness. apparently im her best and most romantic reationship to date, and she is mine, so we're both incredibly happy.
music of the moment: slowly - amon tobin go here and listen, come back and post your feelings on them please urlLink
music of the moment: such great heights (remix) - the postal service yeah ,i dont know. i may be going to market today with dillon and ryan. hopefully someone else will want to come as well. i just need something to do, somewhere to go where there are more people than my e-friends on my computer. pahardcores great but i need real people in my life, a special person for me, friends that are rad beyond beyond rad. i love the friends i got now, but i do need more and i feel i need a lady-friend too (but i wont go into that in this post). pretty much these days i spend all my time with basically one person, hes rad, but i need more people. maybe ill call up some of the people that put their phone number in my yearbook (even though i know they put it in out of yearbook-signing habit). empty places high dry spaces of uninhabited landscape dead trees and burnt leaves the gamma holocaust is overwhelming lonely loves friends, acquaitances, noone concrete raindows driven on by vacant cars empty lives, fost loves, forgotten friendships all of this is is uncomparable to what what is this life, love its all gone, empty, lost fingers sore, eyes dried pixels contorting reality the rhythmic bloodflow of the city is it is faint but still there expeditions, adventures neccessary to live happilly expeditions, adventures loneliness is unexistant friends, loved more everyday loves, lost more, mourned for each hour the flow is what keeps it all going the beat, the rhythm, the flow friends come with the flow loves come with the friends i need the flow
music of the moment: the prize fighter - the velvet teen well this sucks.my computer is really fucke up. its stuck in safe mode and i cant get it out. everything is huge and you cant read a lot of text because its so small yet big (small font pixelized = shit). this really sucks and theres nothing i can do to fix it. i think im gonna have to get someone out here to fix this. goddammit.
ok now i have a soundclick site for my songs. urlLink
music of the moment: noone will ever love you - the velvet teen so yeah, in terms of julia im not sure if i should stay away from her or try to see more of her (this all to get over her). i think that if i saty away from her it wont be that bad because i dont have those "feelings" when im not around her, but at the same time i think that the next time i see her it will just be a last night repeat. on the other hand if i try ot see more of her i thinkill be able to start looking at her more as a friend and not as something else, but i think that it would be hard asa hell to do so because every time i see her itll be just another last night. FUCKIN SHIT!

music of the moment: back from space - amon tobin so yeah, tonight i chilled with julia (my ex) and im so pissed off right now. i cant even really percisely say why. so me and my friend went down to her work because we were gonna go somewhere for dinner and we hadnt decided yet. we went down there and chilled there for like 30 mins as she was closing up the shop. in there i was noticing myself acting around her how i was in the time leading up to us "going out" i.e. flirting like a mutha and reeeeeeeally enjoying her company. once that was overwith (being inside as she was closing up), we stood outside for like 15 more minutes trying desperately to figure out somewhere to go for food. we ended up going to this mexican restaurant down the street and as we were waiting for our food i found myself acting the same as i was when we were in her store. i didnt like that [i]at all[/i]. so we got our food and drove up to some park to eat it. keep in mind that my friend was there the whole time probably helping me to be less awkward and uncomfortable - thank you dillon. we ate our food at some bench and i tried reeeeeeeeeeeeeally hard to not flirt with her but i just ended up insulting her and acting like a jackass the whole time. fuck. we sat there (me ungodly uncomfortable with myself) and had a little dumb bullshit talk, you know, making dumb jokes and whatnot. then my friend calls her out of the blue and ends up coming down to the pak to chill with us. we ended up standing around his car for a bit trying to figure out what to do. we decided to meet at my friends car (the one who i was with at julias store) and figure something out to do once we got there. nope. nothin havin. we chilled outside there for like another half an hour trying (again) to figure out what to do. now, this was prolly the point where i was most re-diggin on her. that was so lame, oh my god. there was one point where she was laying on her car and i wsa just thinking "fuck, if we were still together id be laying on her car with her." im only half-disgusted with myself for thinking that only because when we were "going out" we werent really "going out." like at all. we were just people that verbally expressed our adoration and admiration of eachother. what really got to me tonight was that it was not unlike when we were "going out," and i just kept thinking, fuck, i dont even know, my mind is awhirl right now, cant figure things out entirely. on the way back (with the original friend) i asked him if he noticed me flirting a lot (just to see how blatant it was). he said he cant usually tell when someones flirting or not. hes lying. he knows exactly what i was doing and to what extent it was being done. and now i am here, (attempting to) express my odd thoughts in my head and how they got there and why. as you can tell i cant. i guess what it comes down to is this: i still reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally like her. and for that im fucked. awesome.
music of the moment: sink florida sink - against me! so i hate my computer more than anything right now.i tried to install a burner drive and now its saying that there isnt even a cdrom drive. what the fuck man? this sucks. i finished my dance song. its not too great. goddamn. yeah, i use fruity loops for music production and i make a lot of songs and today i finished my dance track. its cool. kindof. im still really pissed off about my computer though.....

so, theres this asian chick i met through julia the ive been talking to a bit lately. she may like me. i dont know.........ill keep up the details as they come..........
(everyone seems to do this so i will too...) music of the moment: death cab - new year earlier to day i had something in mind ot post on here. now i cant remember it. damn, this is annoying. my friend had break up bash with his girlfriend of 4 months the other day. he said he hasnt been feelin it for about 3 weeks, and now hes already on the prowl again. fuck him. my other friend is gettin along with some chick and my other friend is gettin along with a friend of that chick. fuck them all. i want someone so bad. goddammit. i talked to julia the other day. that was a little odd. i felt some tense undertones in our conversation that i did not like at all. fuck that. at least we're still on talking terms. fuck, apparently a bunch of people i know know about this blog of mine. i dont like that at all. im thinking of changing it or using a different service or something. hahahaha, they wont like that when they read it. went to clos on friday - best fuckin show ive ever been to at clos. damn. first off there was john courage, a kindof country type thing with no drummer, actually they do - its the audience's hands and feet. then came DERIVATIVE!!!!!!!! so great, such a fucking cool jazz/funk/hip-hop thing!!!!! they fuckin rocked as shit! then was my friends band - girls in suede. they were sooooooo good. they have really tightened up and perfected their songs and their playing. shit they were good. i was so sore on saturday from rockin so hard on fiday......goddamn..... fuck......still cant remember what i was gonna say........ill get back to this when i do........
ok many developements in my life: 1. school is out. no more for 3 whole months. best news ive gotten in a long time. this is gonna be rad. 2. i think im back on track with my friends. things seem to be going good with all of them. thats good, now ill have something to do over the summer. 3. i already said that julia broke it off with me at the beginning of this week. not cool. shits just been really crazy for her lately and i just make it crazier. i dont know though; we werent really "going out" in the traditional sense, we were more just friends that verbally expressed our admiration and such about each other. we were really emotionally close, but thats about it. if we were physically closer, i think this would have been way harder for me. its not that bad though, although i am sad that we wont be talking much anymore, thats shitty. i dont know though, i think im already at least a little over it. 4. things with the guy (from "suicide") seem to be back together now. there havent been anymore blow-ups or anything like that, and we seem to be on good terms........although i do feel a certain underlying tension between us.........lame. we seem to be back to normal, i know i want it to be.............. 5. ive decided that this summer i WILL go find more friends. its really not that hard. but yeah, i want more friends that are more like me, into that same shit im into, just good people. well, i guess thats it for now. later
well, tonight julia broke it off. she dumped me. she said that right now she has too much going on in her life and that i juat made things for her that much more crazy. yeah, im saddened, but i kindof saw it coming. its lame and all. yeah. fuck.
so tonight a friend told me online that for the past 4 years he has been contemplating suicide. he was telling me the most intimate details of his mind and he placed his trust in me to not tell. he stopped responding to my ims for an hour, so i got really fucking scared and i told my parents. this is one thing he told me not to do. he said that if i told anyone, the shit would hit the fan. i told my parents. i betrayed his trust. my parents called his mom (divorced) and she called him. he called me a few minutes later and asked what the fuck i did. i told him and he replied with a quick "fuck you" and a hang up. i feel like shit. i betrayed one of my best friends trust at a time when he felt he needed it the most he ever has. i do feel however that i did the right thing. he will (hopefully) be getting help. but i still feel like shit because i lost one of my best friends. i know i sound selfish as hell right now, but i really do care about him. thats why i told, and thats why he hates me. i did the right thing, but at the expense of a good friend.
getting yearbooks today. im somewhat excited, i guess as excited as you can get over a book of pictures. julia is actually in the yearbook class, along with the guy that informed me of all the secret hatred towards me. so now i have to go back to school to get mine (i ditched out early today). i gotsta leave in like less than an hour.
the apple and the butterfly are like one in the forest of light
everythings cool in julia land. she just has some shit she has to work through (stress, school, work...) so really her change of persona has nothing to do with me. that made me really happy. i said: "is everything cool between you and me?" she replied: "yeah, everythings fine" i said: "ok, because i know eveything is cool on my side..." she replied: "yeah, its all cool over here too" that made me happy. now i know everythings cool (i hope) and i just need to give her some time to work some shit out. she said after this week thingsll be better. im so happy for her. i was worried for a while, but now, i know shes ok. (sigh of relief).........
so, im sensing something may have gone awry. i dont know, i dont like this. there may be a problem with me and julia and i intend to figure/work it out. we both, however, told eachother that we'd be completely honest about how we felt, so if she had some problem with me, im hoping shed tell me. im going to talk to her and put all this hopefully needless stress and paranoia behind me. i dont have a very good feeling about this..................

urlLink If i was a serial killer i would be David Berkowitz . Originally believed to be a paranoid schizophrenic, David Berkowitz (the Son of Sam), claimed to be plagued by demons that came in the form of dogs, when the dogs would howl, that was their signal for him to kill. He said that the dogs would call out to him for blood and death, and their cry's would only stop by killing and assaulting over 6 New York women. In a later interview Berkowitz revealed that the demon story was a conscious fabrication that he had made up to force the police into believing he was insane if he was caught. He also confessed that he would become sexually aroused when stalking his victims and would sometimes come back to the crime scenes and masturbate while envisioning his prior killings. kill count: 6 ugh

music of tha moment: distric sleeps alone remix - the postal service so yesterday was my sisters birthday party, and there was no way i was going to be there to experience any of it. so i called my friend julian up and we saw spiderman 2. ok movie, there was waaaaaaaaaay too much love/romance/drama shit and not enough fighting/action scenes, but the few there were were sooooo fucking rad. spiderman 3 is gonna be fuckin cool though. so after the movie we got some really bad chinese food, and while we're eating it julians friend wei calls him up and we end up chillin with her - for approx. 7 hours. that was rad though, she a really awesome person and i hope i get to chill with her again. for a bit of it it was really weird because her and julian had only chilled like 6 times before and i hadnt ever, so it was a little expectedly awkward. as it went on though things started getting better, no more werid awkward shit. we ended up at aromas drinking *ack* tea for like 2 hours then we went out and chilled in her car in the aromas parking lot for another 2 hours. that was rad, we was juat talking and, wow, getting the wei experience - attacking my balls with a a water bottle, fake(?) orgasming, talking of erect peni, other things along those lines. shes rad, but its weird - i feel as though ive known her for a really long time, i dont know why, i just dont know, yeah, its weird, huh, whatever. we went back to my house and ate my sisters birthday cake and pizza and soda and chips. we all were about this close to puking. awesome. they left and i dont know what they did if anything. that was rad. i gotta chill with her again, so if youre reading this wei, hit me up on aim. oh, and julian apparently is having a police investigation on him. theyre going around finding all his stuff and i dont know what theyre gonna do once theyve compiled all that. hah. good luck julian.......
music of the moment: a forest - the cure now, to me a blog is a place to have a conversation with anyone who may be reading it - a one sided conversation. what i mean is that whats in a blog should be left in the blog, not taken out and talked about outside of it. another thing: comments. i feel comments should just be ssdfsfdsomething in response to the post, not a "correction" or criticism. please, if youre going to just criticize what ive written or try to "correct" me, just dont leave a comment at all. just a few words. ive been getting kinda annoyed by that kind of stuff and im just asking, politely asking, that you (anyone who reads or responds to my blog) to not do that
music of the moment: lovesong - the cure shit, great movie, and i think the best part was that i got in for free - thanks ethan. it was waaaaaay better than i had expected seeing as it was an mtv movie. i was suprised (and relieved) that there wasnt gratuitus slapstick shit or bad jokes or one liners or popular music, it was just a really great movie with no plot. kip, uncle, debb, tina, napoleon, pedro, shit, all fucking great characters. shit, my friend in pennsylvannia just had a really bad blow out with her boyfriend. i feel sooooooooooo bad for her because she really really loves him and shes such a fucking great girl. shit sara, im sooooooooo sorry. in other news, sometime this summer my friend and i (and hopefully some others) will be embarking on a bus trip to frisco. we gotsta go down there and tear shit up, have a good time, maybe catch a show, i dont know, i just need to have fun doing something outside of santa rosa and (fuckin shit...) sebastopol. boring-ass cities = boring-ass lives. well, it turns out my friend actually got arrested but he doesnt think therell be a fine to be paid, thank god. hmmmm........ rockin the cure fo life as of now, shit..... oh, and check the new font. pretty emo eh?
music of the moment - (kickin it old skool) close to me - the cure so i found out earlier tonight that my friend got like arrested the other night. hes a writer and apparently he was bombing with his other friend and crewmate then decided to go out by himself. and he got caught. by the cops. laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame. apparently (according to his friend) he owes at least 4000 bones. shiiiiiiiiiiiit. thats so lame. well now i guess he has something to do with that summer job money. yeah, i went to market by myself tonight (no dillon or ryan) and actually ran into my friend elizabeth. she was being weird elizabeth bitch chick like always all in my face saying dumb shit. whichever. shes cool. thats where i ran into my friends crewmate and learned of the shit. hmm, not much going on in the life of shane lately, just chillin, bein bored, listening to the cure and this new postal service stuff (i love soulseek). ive gotten so into electronic music, its od, a couple months ago i wouldve fucking taken anything over techno or hXc raver shit, but its actually pretty cool. ive found that punk is a great starter or gateway genre, it was with me at least. lets track my musical interests shall we: 7th grade - started getting into "rock" i.e.: korn, (unfortunately) limp bizkit, sublime, slipknot. i aint ashamed of any of that. 8th grade - somewhere between 7th and 8th i found green day, particularly the album "dookie." to this day that is still one of my favorites. gotta kick it oldschool. green day led to epitaph punk such as nofx, bad religion, us bombs, and many other generic pop-punk-esque bands. skip ahead to freshman year ; at the end of the year in my french class a friend told me about a band called "anti-flag," thus beginning a never ending love affair with political punk. from anti-flag i got into other a-f records bands like thought crime and pipedown. i had also gotten into older political stuff - DK, subhumans, etc. pver the summer i had gone to a tsunami bomb show and i loved it. (old) tsunami bomb is rad. 10th grade - i was now into such bands as chocking victim, leftover crack, indk, morning glory, hot snakes, and many others, i cant even name them all. i had also started getting into more "hardcore" punk like a global threat, bands of that nature. this is where i started straying from the path: along with punk, i had started getting into old rock stuff like acdc, the beatles, guns n roses, maybe thats it. i love acdc though. i had also gone to a get get go show the summer after sophmore year which sparked my love for hardcore/noise. get get go, archeopterix, blood brothers, the locust, its all good, gotta love that noise. i also got into the kindof weird indie stuff i.e. fugazi, the mars volta, and some psychobilly: tiger army, mad sin, batmobile, mad heads, nekromantix; these bands led to rockabilly, which was really found at a phenomenauts show at the phoenix that summer. last year - now i was well-immersed in the hardcore/noise stuff but i wasnt quite all in there yet. a friend of mine introduced me to converge the summer earlier and, shit, theyre one of my favorite bands. they led to other hXc acts such as orchid and, well, thats it i think. now that i had some real hXc under my belt it was time to move to the next level - the postal service? yeah, i was online and found an electronic emo band called the postal service. theyre great and they led to my emo phase: death cab, mineral, bright eyes, coldplay, capn jazz, iron and wine, mates of state. shit im emo nowadays. now with the emo came more hXc: botch, as i lay dying, circle takes the square, the black dahlia murder, and american nightmare/giveuptheghost (RIP). from the postal service came other pseudo electronic bands like the notwist, kindof half electronic. then i found amon tobin. he is the greatest. shit i love his stuff. recently its been all about the velvet teen, amon tobin,as i lay dying, the cure, the postal service, madness, and owls. see what im listening to now? emo and electronic and hardcore and ska. its all from punk. gotsta love punk and the dumb little punk kid in all of us. fuckin shit i love music. im a fuckin music junkie, its horrible but awesome at the same time. gotta love the rockinest most rock-steady beat of madness!!!
indeed it is.......
fisrt of, as always: music of the moment:coffin nails - the locust bitches......... im back. time for a play by play run-through of the last 5 days of my life...... last thursday i stayed up for the night, thinking that i would be just as exhausted after sleeping for no time as i would for sleeping for 32 hours. i was right, but i wasnt able to sleep in the car for the 8-hour drive down to costa mesa (all the while driving through parts of oakland that made me really want to live there). we arrived at 3050 bristol st. at approximately 2:30 pm. we had time to check in, take our luggage to the 7th floor (the nicest) and leave to go get some bad mexican fast-food. once we got back my parents announced that they would be giving us (my sister and i) 100 $$$ each. that was so cool. flash-forward to saturday....... actually nevermind. its too much to write. in all i left with a new pocket knife and these 17 cds: letting off the happiness - bright eyes lifted, or.... - bright eyes the forbidden love ep - death cab jane doe - converge new medicines - dead poetic the locust - the locust the locust - the locust plague soundscapes - the locust the locust - the locust supermodified - amon tobin only chasing safety - underoath owls - owls (this is) the dream of evan and chan - dntel tremulant ep - the mars volta kid a - radiohead frail words collapse - as i lay dying pleasure of resistance - kissing tigers all equalling $217. im a hoe. and it turns out that virgin megastore is a fucking awesome store. i got alls them there. the locust is my new favorite band. want to know anything else? ask.
music of the moment: heavy lifting - ambulance ltd The Flying Camel - A personal favorite. As she is lying on her back and you are hammering her from your knees, you carefully balance yourself without using your arms to prop yourself up. You then to flap your arms and let out a long, shrieking howl. Strictly a class move The Ram - Again, you're attacking from behind, when you start ramming her head against the wall in a rhythmic motion. The force of the wall should allow for deeper penetration. Very handy for those lulls in penile sensitivity. Dog in a Bathtub - This is the proper name for when you attempt to insert your nuts into a girl's ass. It is so named because it can be just as hard as keeping a dog in the tub while giving it a bath Pink Glove - This frequently happens during sex when a girl is not wet enough. When you pull out to give her the money, the inside of her twat sticks to your hog. Thus, the pink glove. The Fountain of You - While sitting on her face and having her eat your ass, jerk off like a madman. Build up as much pressure as possible before releasing, spewing like a venerable geyser all over her face, neck and tits. (Better in her bed) The Blumpkin - You need to find a real tramp to do this right. It involves having her suck you off while you're on the shitter. The Bismark - Another one involving oral sex. Right before you are about to spew, pull out and shoot all over her face. Follow that with a punch and smear the blood and jism together. The Fur Ball - You're chomping away at some mighty Zena who has a mane between her legs the size of Lionel Richie's afro, when a mammoth fur ball gets lodged in your throat. You punch her. The Chili Dog - You take a dump on the girl's chest and then titty fuck her. The Rear Admiral - An absolute blast. When getting a chick from behind (with both partners standing), make sure you don't let her grab onto anything when she is bent over. Then, drive your hips into her backside so that the momentum pushes her forward. The goal is to push her into a wall or table, or have her trip and fall on her face. You attain the status of Admiral when you can push her around the room without crashing into anything and not using your hands to grab onto her hips. The Snowmobile - When plugging a girl while she's on all fours, reach around and sweep out her arms so she falls on her face. Lucky Pierre - the middle man in a three way buttfuck. Also known as the french sandwich. Bustard- A very rude bus driver. Cold Faithful- Blowing your visibly-steaming load outside in the winter-time, like when you get your cock sucked on a ski-lift. Grand pappy smash- To beat your meat so hardcore that it starts to chafe and bleed. The Flaming Amazon- This one's for all you pyromaniacs out there. When you're screwing some chick, right when your about to cum, pull out and quickly grab the nearest lighter and set her pubes on fire, then extinguish the flames with your jizz! Old Jism Trail -The stream of semen oozing down the chin and chest of someone who has just finished fellating a senior citizen. Anal Boot- An anal boot is when you take a pitcher of beer, everyone spits in it, someone stirs it with their cock and then the mixture is poured through the crack of a man ass into the waiting mouth of the loser of a bet or drinking game. The Homolic Maneuver -Using your penis to dislodge an object blocking a choking victim's windpipe. Pegging - having a female take you in the rear with a strap on. Angry dragon - This involves the girl giving the guy head and as he is about to cum slapping the girl on the back of the head causing the cum to come out her nose. Great care should be used to not slap her mouth shut. Tony Danza - a takeoff of the donkey punch is called the Tony Danza. When you are about to cum while doing a girl from behind, you say "who's the boss?" and stick it in her ass. Before she says anything you shout "TONY DANZA!" and punch her in the back of the head. Alaskan firedragon - another good take off is one of the angry dragon that is called the alaskan firedragon. When a girl is giving you a blowjob, cum in her mouth unexpectedly and plug up her mouth at the same time. Then whisper in her ear "i have syphilis" so she spews it out her nose. Upperdecking - This one takes practice. This maneuver requires a toilet with a tank above it, like the ones in most homes. Instead of crapping in the bowl, you shit in the tank (i.e. upperdecking). Now don't flush. When the following victim flushes, the rancid waste fills the bowl. If you play your cards right, it may ferment Journey into darkness - This is the most disturbing of all. It entails shitting into another person's asshole. Not for beginners. Rocky Balboa - dont shower for 2 weeks, then spew diarrhea down her throat at any point during sexual contact. Rocky Balboa Title Punch - same as the Rocky Balboa, but in that non-showering 2 weeks all you eat is corn. The McDonald's Quick Draw - Get your girlfriend to talk dirty into the intercom, making the order guy start to beat off. Then while pulling up to the window, have her give you falatio till you are about to blow your beefy chunk-load. Upon pulling up to the window, tell your girl friend to yell "Draw!". Then on "three", both you and the guy blow your loads either on her or eachother. The Throne of Lightning - This is done by fucking a girl while you shit in a toilet. When you're going to blow your load, turn her over and dunk her head in the toilet, while she's bobbing for your turd plummet a river of semen in her ass. Not to be confused with "Ride the Lightning," a Metallica album Abe Lincoln - You're getting a girl up the ass and give her a swift donkey punch to the back of her head, knocking her unconscious. You then turn her around and jerk off and blow your load all over her face. Then you shave her beaver and take the clippings and spread it where you jizzed on her, making a beard that looks like good ol Honest Abe's. The Beverly Hills Whiffer -This move is restricted to those women who think they're God's gift to the world. Find a woman of the above description. Take her home and start doggie styling her. When you're about to blow, corkscrew two fingers into her ass, scraping as much shit as you can from her. Pull out your fingers, reach around her head to stick one finger in each nostril. Pull her head back so she can see you while you yell "So, you think your shit don't stink now ?!" Shanghai Shampoo - Fuck a chick until you've built up a load large enough to paint a room. Blow it all in her hair, rub it in thoroughly. When it dries it will resemble the crunchy noodles often served with chop suey Toboggan - when you attack from behind on your partner, push them and then ride them down the stairs like a tobaggon sled. The Pirate Maker - When your sitting on a girls face and she's sucking on your nuts, you start poking her in the eye with your cock. Spanish Inquisition - This is kind of like the Snowmobile. While fucking a woman in the ass, grab her arms and bring them up behind her, arching her back. Then yell, "Nobody Expects the Spanish Inquisition." For some variation, add a donkey punch. Ali - When giving a guy a hummer, start punching his nutsack as if it were a punching bag. The Mushroom Tattoo (aka Mushroom Welt/print) - when a chick's going down on you, you pull it out, pull it back and whip her in the forehead with it Squeegee - when your fucking a girl in the ass, when your about to cum, you stick a pin in one of her ass cheeks, thus making her clench up and cleaning all the shit off your cock as you pull out at the same time. Seal the Envelope - When hooking up with a really drunk girl and she passes out before you cum, turn her over and blow your load all over her ass crack. When it drys, it will seal her butt cheeks together and she will have to pry them open the next day god, people are rediculous..... some of these are really funny though

music of the moment: mr brightside - the killers urlLink on her neck?
music of the moment: jenny was a friend of mine - the killers so first off, if my posts have seemed a little "empty" lately, its because i seriously write about what is happening. so empty posts = nothing going on at all. ive kindof managed to detatch myself from the lame highschool drama in my life, so there is part of the reason for my empty, shell-of-a-post posts. i just need to stay away from solitaire. this made me happy though: and awesome. check the stuffed eagle in the first picture and the shinguards in the second. hmmm, the oc should be good for me: spend some money, walk alone around a city ive never been to, be away from santa rosa for a bit. too bad (or thank god) its only for 5 days. thats all i have to look forward to in these last 26 days of summer. that and the phenomenauts show on the 28th, that is completely relying on nick not having anything to do that one fucking night. that always happens: we have plans to go to phenomenauts then he has to go to like a funeral or something. it sucks. ive missed seeing them like 4 times now. goddammit. yay for school to start! structure is headed my way!

GODDAMMIT!!!!!!!!!!
music of the moment: counting backwards - the velvet teen 1.Miss, If you've lost your virginity, can I have the box it came in? 2.There are 265 bones in the human body. How would you like one more? 3.Would you like to come to a party in my toolshed? 4.(my favorite) How about you and I go back to my place and get out of these wet clothes? 5.Is your last name Gillette, it must be because you are the best a man can get. 6.I need a little help with my Calculus, can you integrate my natural log? 7.Pick a number between 1 and 10.

I'm really pissed right now. Its 45 minutes until midnite on a Sunday, and I'm working at the office to try to appease a client I never wanted to serve in the first place. Nothing else to say. I have worked for this firm since 1990. I think I'm going to leave. In fact, I think I've already left the firm mentally. I just don't know where I'm going next. But I think I'm already gone. I think that was the title of an Eagle's song.
Here is the first part of a short story I have written. Let me know if you are interested in seeing more. Around Here By five minutes after six o’clock on Saturday morning, Calvin Powell had showered, shaved, and had buttoned the last in a row of buttons on his starched white shirt. He could smell coffee brewing as he stood upright from tying his shoes. He buckled his brown leather belt and straightened his khaki pants. As he walked down the hallway to the kitchen, the closed bedroom door on his left reminded him there were three guests in that room. As he approached the kitchen on his right, he looked into the living room on his left and saw his eighteen month old granddaughter Abigail sitting in front of the television set and realized he had been wrong. There were only two guests in that room. The youngest was awake already. Lucille was dressed, too. Like Calvin, she was dressed today just as any other day except Sunday. She wore a lightweight cotton dress indistinguishable from the dresses she had worn other days, except it was sky blue with small flowers in contrast to the green, yellow, pink, and white dresses with larger flowers and smaller butterflies she wore at other times. She wore an apron to protect her dress from the splattering sausage she was cooking to accompany the pancakes she would make once everyone was awake. “Abigail has already eaten,” Lucille said, leaning her head back to point towards the eighteen month old in the other room, while her eyes directed Calvin’s attention to the Pop-Tart wrapper on the counter. Calvin said good morning to Lucille, kissed her softly on the lips, poured his coffee, and walked over to the table where Lucille already had the paper set aside for him. It was the same routine he had followed nearly every day for thirty six years.
Testing 1...2...3....
Its my second favorite kind of day in l.a., overcast, cool and cloudy. my favorite day in l.a. is when its raining cats and dogs and the whole city goes quiet and clean and the trees lose their layer of dust and shine w new green-ness.... yeah, that hasn't happened in a long f**king time.... anyway, my husband adam sent me this blogging info and i decided to set this up. i have, for awhile, wanted to be able to extend into a larger forum some of the ideas and discussions that regularly take place in my classes w actors. i am consistently blown away by what happens when a group of artists (and know this about me, my reference to actors as 'artists' is about as artsy as you'll catch me being... maybe.) are encouraged to dialogue about their craft. the conversations rarely stay within the contained topic of acting and almost always veers into discussions of life and its participants, i.e. all of US, you and me... i know that we live in a media obsessed culture. the question is, seemingly, no longer when will i get my fifteen minutes of fame, but what am i willing to do to get my share... acceptance, being permission to move ahead, i accept this era and my part so that i can explore what is available to be learned by being born here and now. nostalgia be damned! i say these are the 'good old days' if we know how to live in them both as an observer and a participant... the person who chooses acting as their career is choosing, quite often, a difficult path. from the p.o.v. of a person who works with everyone, from those whose trophies were presented on a global stage to those whose only trophies were recently presented on a quickly fading high school stage, the fears and concerns of the actor/artist are universal. the disquieted ,unsatisfied nature of the artist seems inherent, rarely finding a place to rest for too terribly long. the inner critic rages as mercilessly and as loudly as outer critics, parents, casting directors, who, under pressure and with no understanding of how delicate the artists sensibilities are, will issue thoughtless feedback through an agent or manager... now, this is a rash generalisation, many casting directors have moved from the career of being actors themselves into the world of casting and miraculously have retained a love and respect for actors andther processes. from where i sit, i wish these casting people could see the difference when an actor is going in for someone they feel respected by vs. those who forget that ultimately the actor is creating their art not from a canvas or piece of marble, but from themselves... so vulnerable. perhaps i will put some effort into collecting the names of casting people who live the love... we should come up with a name for and give them awards for retaining their humanity in a business that says don't take too long with no names, but do find the next julia roberts and do it now! now let me be clear, i do not recommend coddling, i recommend clarity and the actors who have studied with me through the years know that i prize clarity in my communication above all else... that said, i see no reason to EVER lose sight that an audition, or an acting class is nothing more than a random grouping of chaotic elements that enters and exits the life of an actor with such speed and repetition that if the experience be allowed to morph into barnacles of cynicism seems too counter productive... and often appeals to the perfectionist that is keeping score along with the inner critic... i work with an actor who is a veteran of television shows and films, her career has soared and crashed and is now in mid soar again. we rarely have a session where she doesnt cry about something or another... is she self indulgent? are the tears not authentic? NEVER. she feels it all and expresses it all. i actually envy her. and if she ever stops feeling everything, because she does laugh as loudly as she mourns, it will be a sad day for actors everywhere because the inspiration to feel, to actually feel, is few and far between . i often times challenge actors as to why they would take classes with me when they so rarely inquire as to my perception of good acting... i ask what would you do if you'd studied w me forever and then found out that i thought the best acting was some sort of self conscious acting that made you want to leave acting forever and open up a bakery somewhere... well for those who care, my version of the best acting is when it doesnt feel, smell or taste like acting, it feels like life. and that is to say, it feels unpredictable, spontaneous and free... who do you think fits in this category? i gotta run, jonesy needs a walk and an up and coming actor named cam is on his way to my office to put an audition on tape... tonight is a fundraiser for my friend andrea's documentary about the march for women's rights on washington last april... you should visit their web site and purchase a couple wax bush tee shirts, instant classics, even if we dont agree w the questions , i still feel the need to support the question ask-ers and my friend andrea is one hell of a questioner. the website is urlLink waxbush2004.com and with all the preparation going into burning man, leaving on monday the 30th, not back till the 7th, i dont know when i will have time to write but will try. i promise. just know this about me, the reason i have a career in hollywood is because I DO NOT DROP NAMES, i believe in the privacy of my relationships w artists and so please dont ask and i apologise in advance for any frustrations... and yet, i look forward to your questions about whatever and whomever. i am only as good a teacher as i am a student... so lets get into it!
YAO MING! This is the golden nugget of achievements suckas! Yo this is goin' mad far and you chiefs aint stoppin' this, unless you sing in the village people, which I doubt. Since this is the first post, it doesn't have much, but I PROMISE the next one will be filled with shit, like an 8 year old girl who's R. Kelly's best friend! In the words of that guy from that place, "Yo, I'm out."
I'v decided not to start the Stuff page up in full force until I move this site to a real domain. What I mean by this is that I'm not gonna spend time on this or have anyone else update this blog until I move it to a real web domain, along the lines of www.intellectual-void.com, but I don't have the benjamins right now to do that. But it will happen soon, prbly after the first coming of the urban cowboy...
That's right! A new post! Nothing special yet though, just like to mention that I'm gonna change the entire site to look like this template and the one I have as the main blog. What about the billboard? That may soon be coming down...in exchange for... A Webcam. Webcam?! No no, nudey shows are out. This is going to be a [the crowd looks confused] "perspective webcam." What the fuck does that mean? It means that it's not going to be of people, but will be of other shit like out side my window or another window, of the kitchen, of the tv, of me occasionaly. This way you can pretend your in my house al the time! What fun! But honestly its gonna kick ass coz' I'm going to spin it up with some ingenious genious like never heard of. Through it out or not, its goin good. BIG NEWS: THE TRUE MEANING AND PURPOSE OF THE STUFF BLOG! THIS WILL BECOME A TEAM BLOG! ? That means that I will not be the only person who can post on it. I'll allow certain people to post on it, and they can invite others, and soon there will be billions, maybe even millions! A Monster! A Monster! Yep so keep out the eyes- this friday is the coming setup. Nice.
Today was alumni day at LaSalle, and I have to say that that school is making me more depressed each time I find out how much their preppifying it. I mean, it was kinda preppie when we left, but the bootleg side of the school kept it in check. When we left, you still had to duct-tape mic cords to the walls to make sure they reached the mixer, considering before we had to put a mic up to a fuckin boombox for music. Stage crew was actually fun, and there was actually some level of work involved. I remember when I spent half the day downstairs with Mr. Van, when to Mrs. Crushshons knowledge I was helping some kindergarten parents setup for some assembly. You could actually get away with shit like that. Now their redoing the ENTIRE sound system, and revamped the gym. And plus, their redoing the playground! They changed it once, why change it again? If they do anything other then redo the blacktop, then hells gonna break loose. And an ELEVATOR?! No wonder obesity is an epidemic in the U.S.! And the next freshman class knows more people from private schools then they do from their own! WHAT IS OUR WORLD COMING TO?! When will people actual realize that change is good, but once you start making meaningless and un-needed changes, shit starts to break down. Oh fuck, arthritis. Did you know all dogs are part of the same species? No matter what breed they are, there still the same species. And did you know that by definition, Mules are not living things?! Who makes these rules anyway... THIS BRINGS US TO OUR SEGMENT: IF NIKESH COULD REWRIGHT ALL THE STUPID RULES AND LAWS THAT RUN OUR SOCIETY, WHAT WOULD HE REPLACE THEM WITH? Stay tuned cause this shits gonna get good.
So I'm walking home from school today and guess who I see: Steve Ivcich. Except it wasn't Steve Ivcich. It was Steve Ivcich, just 15 years younger. And he wasn't named Steve Ivcich. This is yet again another example of me seeing someone who I know except just at a different age. For example, last summer I did my community service hours at Ronald McDonald House, which is this place by Children's Memorial Hospital that gives free room and board to people who don't live in the area but don't know when they can return home because their kid has a disease, is badly injured, etc. So the grounds kept at the Ronald McDonald house is named some name I can't remember, but I know his name wasn't Zandy. Except the weird thing is that this guy looked EXACTLY like Zandy, except 30 years older. Same voice, same face, same sense of humor, the whole 9 yards (speaking of 9 yards, I remember this conversation I had a while back about the origin of that phrase and is has something to do with escaping from prisons.) So It's the present day, and yet their are two identical version of the same person(s), except they are of different ages. And have different names. Another example: So I have to go to get a hair cut cause my dad turns into a Fundamentalist when my hair gets to long so I had no choice but to cut it. So I'm off to the Hair Cuttery, the one on Wells and Eugenie to be exact, and I go inside and put my name down and take a seat. So I wait around 15 or so minutes and then this lady tells me to come back. Now this ain't any ordinary lady, this is the one and only Chuck. Yes, the Chuck from Narsty, the Chuck that's George's friend, the one we all only kinda know and yet still love. Except once again, it isn't really Chuck. It's Chuck all right, but 10 years older. And she ain't named Chuck. But other then those two recurring factors, they are one in the same. They listen to the same frickin' music, and not only that, she even told me about how she went to the last Bad Brains concert, and how it sucked cause they played only their most famous shit and then a bunch of their Reggae/Rock/Jazz fusion stuff (Not that that has anything to do with Chuck herself, but it just shows that she has common sense.) If you haven't caught on yet, then let me put the bib on for ya (Red Lobster is overrated.) (like sushi.) All of these examples and stories that I have just given you have one "thing" in common. This one "thing" holds all the pieces of this mysterious puzzle together, and gives it its meaning. This one "thing" has somehow been able to take all of these stories and make them possible; this one "thing" is the glue that holds the pizza pie to the plumber's ass. Until the moment this afternoon when I was walking home from school and I saw Steve Ivcich but I really hadn't, I had always wondered what the one special thing about this "thing" really was. I had always known this "thing" to be this "thing", and yet I always knew that this "thing" had some other purpose, agenda, special thing about this "thing" that always seemed to make weird things happen involving this "thing" that no one could explain. And then, after I passed the Steve Ivcich that wasn't Steve Ivcich, I realized what was the thing about this "thing." This "thing" had the ability to warp our own ideas about people, and reshape them to give us a new understanding of these people. These people are the ones I spoke of. They were once but people I knew, but I didn't really know em'. Now I don't exactly feel like I know know em', but I don't feel like a stranger. And yet I have also realized that this "thing" truly isn't someone different then ourselves. This "thing" in fact holds no superpowers at all, No exotic/erotic voodoo magic, No complex personality that people can't understand, in fact, the only extraordinarily Amazing Thing about This "Thing" Is IT's BLINDing, CHAOS Causing, TUSUNAMI Trembling, ABSOLUTELY RAVISHING SEXINESS! This "Thing" is none other then George Ivcich. p.s. By Sexiness I mean [crowd whisper's in Nikesh's ear]... Sexiness
I am now making a call to you all: (call meaning plead) Please tell people about this blog! Why you ask? What's in it for me? A: What if I told you I would pay you to write for this blog if I could get enough daily visitors, more then just the people we know directly. Sounds good right? To good to be true? Just take a look at www.Gizmodo.com That sight is owned by a guy who just lives off the advertisements on his weblog. That's it. Well you say, why would anyone want to read this blog? It sucks now anyway, no good or interesting readable content anyway. Fair enough. But how about this: what's the one thing that always holds my plans and ideas back from being carried forward? The answer my friends is money. So what if I got enough money from the ads to finance my projects, and then I wrote about them in the blog? People would sure as hell read that. And then I could start putting up movies and pictures and eventually the traffic on the site would be so great that not only could I finance bigger projects, I could also turn in an actual profit from the blog. By the way, the blog by this time would have a real webpage, not this free one I'm on now. And then the I would become WE, and then WE could have simultaneous projects going on and it would be fucking crazy! Pay your way through college, give you something to put on your resumé, something to right your thesis on. And now I want to address one issue that I think separates me and those who believe in my ideas from those who immediately cast them off and say, "That aint gonna happen." Just think about what we could do. Don't think about how were gonna get there, just think about how kick ass it would be when everything is set up and flowin'. Just let the ideas flow, and don't let reality hold you back, cause reality is just what society makes you think is realistic. There are no boundaries when it comes to these Ideas. Yes, Ideas is capitalized. Just fucking forget about how "unrealistic" things are for once. Let your imagination run wild in a field where everything you could possibly need to make your idea come true is at your fingertips. "Realistic" is meaningless. Welcome to my world. Let your mind wonder and don't be afraid/ashamed/fell stupid to think about things that societydoesn'tt accept or you think other people will reject you for. That'ss the best part about thinking, cause no one can intrude on you or invade your privacy. All your thoughts are personal and private, and most importantly, unrestricted. This may sound like the same old bullshit they tell you in preschool except this actually has some value. These ideas give you a new direction in life. I can't tell you how many times I change my opinion on topics after thinking about them. I'm like a supermodel going through Menopause. Damn that's a good quote. Niccolo Machiavelli once proposed, "The ends justifies the means." No they don't, cause the means are always justified if the ends are productive and meaningful. Productive and meaningful you say? How is a Rocket powered RadioFlyer productive or meaningful?! Sentimental value.
PHIL: Tell me what you want, and your in on the bet. I know I'm gonna win, and you know I'm gonna lose, so I know you wanna cash in on this, cause so do I. Any other people who want to be in on this bet between me and George about my trick roping skills should post in the billboard or talk to me somehow. Only one note: EXACTLY 200 DAYS TILL OCEAN'S 12 COMES OUT!!! p.s. 'Seed of Chucky' comes out on Halloween: don't make no plans-courtesy of Max Bagus
So I saw 'Troy' and I have to say that Brad Pitt's butt is NEVER shown, therefore it must be an action movie. Next weekend (May 28-31) I prbly can't do much cause I have finals the week after. After that though I'm out of la escuela and I am dedicating the majority of my time to becoming an urban cowboy. I think we should start a dude ranch in someone's backyard... ANNOUNCEMENTS: 'Seed of Chucky': Chucky has sperm in his eye If artificial diamonds ever become widely available, then hybrid steel-carbon lattice structured materials will rule the world I need help with the h off the oxygen on the backwards limb 007 lives-Terentino best direct the next one Ocean's mother fucin' 12!
Irony of the week: Phil "informed" me of that I was the biggest whiner, more then that of himself. This came from the boy that through a ball that did not belong to his being into an unmarked alley and refused to get it, even though the person who actually owned the ball didn't do shit to him. And then he refused to play football after and delayed my dad by approximately 5 minutes when it was my dad who offered to drive him home. And then when he finally agreed to play football he changed his mind and went fucking Transformers on us and became the one and only classic whinny bitch. OH, THE IRONY! Any off the doo-da, I will officially not stand for any more racial slurs on my person UNTIL I find a better racial slur for Whites, Mexicans, and Jews. Until then, I will not hold back from dropping anyone who does use them against me, unless I have tactically calculated that they in fact have the strategic edge and pure muscular capability to overpower me quickly and efficiently so that they may beat me before I can beat them. Not that I won't laugh at them before I kick your ass, but be forewarned. I have lé información on lé summer: EVERYONE BE WITNESS- I have made a bet with George. The details of this bet follow: George has bet me that I cannot learn how to trick rope and lasso by the end of this summer, which is defined as the first day of MY school year. I begged to differ, and have told George that I will in fact learn how to trick rope and lasso by the end of this summer. If I in fact DO learn how to trick rope and lasso by the end of this summer, then George will be my slave-for-a-day. If George wins the bet, then he will get something from me in return, which as of now has yet to be decided. I WILL PREVAIL, AND SHOW THOSE THAT ARE NOT BELIEVERS THAT I AM THE URBAN COWBOY, RANGER OF THE WILD WILD midWEST!
Welcome to my new blog ladies and gents, and this baby is here to stay! Even the Triple-T knows it! I've signed up with Google's Blogger service so now I don't have to rewrite and repost my page ever time I update it. I'll have the new music page up in a week or two and a 'special' events page... COMING SOON to the new MUSIC page: Daniel Moffett and the Gang - "Mario" The Germs - "Lexicon Devil" The Germs - "Media Blitz" Meat Puppets - "Dolphin Field" Meat Puppets - "Out in The Gardener" Skalpel - "1958" In the words of the guy in that place, "Yo, I'm out" -Gandhi
Another Lovely day on the way to drivers ed, sitting in the back of a bus with 14 other people where only 8 can fit, and Rush Limbaugh blaring on the radio. I have to say, that if it was any warmer, I would have been in hell. Rush Limbaugh? The devil. God? Forget him. Jesus? Dead. Fahrenheit 9/11 kicked ass. I wish it had focused more on the false motives that led to the war in Iraq, but hey, its all good. Music update: I was listening to the Bundu Boys after Andrew left on Friday, and I got to thinking...The world would be a better place if Americans listen to world music. American music is always about an image, a philosophy, a motive, a feeling. But world music is not like that. World music is about music. I like songs with a political message in em, but still; I like to just sit back and not give a shit every once in a while. People are way to serious about things in this world. And no, world hunger and war are not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about vanity and society: people are to self conscious and AFRAID that they'll fuck up in life. Why do you think we have so much more homework as students now then our parents did 30-40 years ago. They say we have to work harder, cause the world is more competitive now then it was before. But that's because people don't sit back and say, "Hey! Hey....." Today with live two lives: One in the present, and one in the future. People are pressured into living in the future, by being forced to do hard work now, so that you'll do better in the future. But what happens when that future gets here? Then you need to talk about your 401k plan, how to invest for your retirement. And what about when that future gets here, your retirement? Then you think about your death, how your family is going to support itself, your will. And then that future arrives. What are you gonna plan after that? Nothing. To bad you realized on your death bed that instead of living in the future you could have spent your time in the present. Cared for your family. Had fun with your friends. Loitered in the time you had, the time that never felt like it would run out. Haven't people realized? 80 years is a long fucking time. But what happens when you do live in the present only? Well fucking look at me: 3 pills a day, a visit to the therapist once a week, a trip to the psychiatrist quarterly, and a piece of shit high school. And I wouldn't give that shit up for anything. So what if you get hell for you decisions. Live in the present. Fuck the stiff. Lets TANGO!
IT"S HERE! The Stuff page is finally (almost) finished!!! I still need to fix some things, but I really wanted to get it out there to see what you all thought of it. The Stuff page is still not complete, but it's so close you shouldn't have that many problems. It's basically a page dedicated to odd shit I find around the web, or odd stories I have, or oxy morons, and funny stuff or spit your guts out stuff or shit in a bowl stuff or lots of other stuff. It's gonna get a hell of a lot better, once I announce the REAL reason that's gonna make it different from all other blogs you have read. But I wont announce that till when its officially complete. Until then, comment and tell me what you think I need to change before the final release, or just what you think of it. In the final I'll have the spacing and alignment setup right, and link to post comments will be right on the main page. I am going to update the music page soon to, so stay tuned.
The Stuff page is coming along nicely and should be up and running within the next few days. I have some very bad news. On the 1st of July, I will be leaving for Michigain, where I will spend two weeks with my grandfather. That is not bad news at all. The bad part is that (be prepared): MY PARENTS ARE MAKING ME TAKE A CELL PHONE [Choke - Barf] [the crowd breakes into a riot] The worst part is that I can't use my mom's or my sister's, coz' they need it. I hereby am kicking my plans for getting that kick ass Motorola phone off eBay into high gear so if, in the rare and catostrophic event I have to keep the phone, I can at least rip it apart and make it look presentable. THE NO CELL PHONE CLUB STILL LIVES!
It's another lovely day in the neighborhood with the 9/11 Commision and Investigative Panel, where dumb struck congressmen restate the obvious and make it look like new news! Shall we take today's headline of the Chicago Tribune : Panel: No Iraq link to 9/11 DUH! How fucking stupid are these people! How long have we already know this?! MONTHS! YEARS! GOD DAMN DECADES! Why does the American public need a 1.5" Headline to Realize that There was no connection between Iraq and 9/11! I WANT TO SHIT MY PANTS! I would like to take a moment now to predict the future. What is going to happen in Iraq? Hmm, that's a damn good question. Let's take ANOTHER look at one of today's Headlines from the one and only Chicago Tribune : Sadr tells militia to stand down, says he will form political party Just fucking GREAT! The last thing that Iraq fucking needs is a god damn cleric pissing off the U.S. forces while also undermining their efforts by actually gaining popular support for a religious dictatorship! DO YOU SEE THE CONNECTION?!... "Hello, this is Hitler speaking. This is who? Moqtada al who? S�derr? What did you call me?! Are you a Jew? Oh, you hate Jews? How lovely! You seek to reclaim the land the Jews have stolen from your people? What a coincidence, I happen to want the exact same thing! What's this, organized violence and holy war? Oh this is turning me on, don't stop! DON'T STOP! What?! The west is evil? I smell an alliance... what did you say your name was? Could you spell that out please? Ok, hold on, lemme get a pen here... ok go. M-O-Q-T-A-D-A A-L S-A-D-R... I'll try to remember that. Oo, what's this? Your a naughty boy? Oh my, now this is getting somewhere..." Yes Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls: Sadr is just like fucking Hitler! Except the Jews already have a national state, control the region and have key alliances with the U.S., the other thing Sadr hates (that being western unethical values). WHAT SHALL WE DO! I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go to Max B.'s house and pickup the stuff I left at his house from the weekend of the Art Fair. And then I'm goin' to bed. Have a good night, and drive safely.
Yo this weekend was pretty damn nice minus the fact that the public school kids have finals which ment a select few were unable to do anything fun, and because of that were slightly agitated. In other news: 4, count em', 4 lesbians were sighted making out last Saturday alone The bridge and bouncing thing with 4 posts have been removed from the LaSalle playground I am going to ad a count down clock on the stuff page when its up for the days until Ocean's 12 comes out Back at the Brotherhood: Rush Limbauhghhoweveryouspellhisname is a necrophiliac and wants to fuck Reagan's dead body Farenhiet 9/11 comes out JUNE 25! I'm going to Michigain for the first 2 weeks of July I get my drivers permit tommorow (June 15) Recent sightings of the elusive quotes: "That's How We Do! John Woo! Chicken Poo!" -Andrew "That's it. I'm leaving." -Phil
I am contemplating whether to keep the Billboard, as it seems it does not get much use (which is logical considerng hardly anyone reads this...Xanga is for sissies.) I am also going to do away with the Events page, and replace it with a Stuff page. The Stuff page would have odds and ends, such as an animated flash music video for Tenacious D's "Fuck her Gently" among other things. I am sorry to announce that I cannot post Daniel's song on the upcoming new music page because hes a bitch and won't give it to me. The Skalpel song won't be up there just yet because the CD hasn't been released through any major providers in the U.S. yet. Now that I think of it, I'm jsut gonna make the Stuff page right now. UPDATE: The Events page will be replaced by the Stuff page within the next few weeks, and will have kick ass stuff like "Banana Phone" and other crazy shit.
I hope you all took the time to read my previous post on how formal clothing is going to destroy our society. There will be more posts like it in the future, concerning other stupid laws, rules, etc. that I deem idiotic, pointless, destructive, or worthy of being referred to as "political propaganda." HOWEVER, I will take a short break from that saga to turn my attention to my new quest: My dissertation on Parasitic Worms in Humans NEWS FLASH: I most likely will not be able to deck out in western cowboy, 1860s-esk garbs on the last day of Public school. This is due to the cost factor (who would've guessed) and nothing else. I even found a kick ass pair of batwing chaps and boots w/ spurs to wear, but I do not have the capital to acquire such goods. However, this DOES NOT signal the demise of the Urban Cowboy, as I will eventually return TO KICK ALL YOUR ASSES! GEORGE AND PHIL AND ALL THOSE IN ON OUR BET: YOUR FUCKIN' GOIN' DOWN DOPES! DON'T QUESTION MY WRATH! THE URBAN COWBOY LIVES!
I, SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE UNIVERSE AND ALL UNDERLINGS, NIKESH PATEL, HEREBY OPEN CASE FILE #38027-1: STUPID RULE OF SOCIETY #1: FORMAL CLOTHING Formal clothing makes me sick. Not only does it not serve any purpose whatsoever, it just makes everyone else's life chaotic and tense. Not only has formal clothing changed our culture for the worse, I believe it could single handedly plunge our society back into the Dark Ages. Now don't get me wrong, I still think penguin tuxes kick ass. But I never said I hated clothing in general, I just hated "formal clothing." A tux is just another article of clothing, which in theory should be worn just as much as any everyday t-shirt or pair of pants (minus the fact that they are next to impossible to clean and cost a fuck load of money.) But affix the adjective "formal" in front of clothing, and all hell breaks loose. I will start first by addressing why so many people in our society disagree with me, and then why they are in fact mentally extinct dopes. A large percentage of our population, predominantly middle-class families with some sort of religious faith, attends functions that require formal dress and would not question it in a heartbeat. They believe that at these functions, such as weddings, bar/bat mitzvahs, and benefits, formal clothing is appropriate and it is rude not to wear it. They do not want to appear shabby, rugged, or god forbid informal. However, these people have yet to realize one fatal flaw with their reasoning: what is defined as shabby, rugged, or informal? And by whom? The answer to this, my underlings, is not only simple, it is written on captain obvious him self’s t-shirt. Shabby, rugged, and informal clothing is defined by a person’s perception of what society deems appropriate. So if these people believe that society considers t-shirts, baggy pants and fishnet stockings shabby, rugged and informal, then whom did society get this idea from? The answer to this, my feline friends, is human nature. What? Human nature? What the fuck does the nature of humans have to do with why formal clothing is the bane of human civilization? It has everything to do with it. Humans are many things, but most importantly humans are greedy. Oh wait you say, but I'm not greedy. You may not think so, but greed is an essential part of human survival, and we would absolutely not be the dominant species on this planet if we weren't. Oh hold it right there you accuse, I give my old clothes to homeless shelters and volunteer in my community. Good for you I say, you should feel good about yourself. But answer this question: Do you eat? Of course you say, I eat because food is necessary for my survival. And I say sure it is, but what about the child starving in the third world country with an economy that can barely support its corrupt government, doesn't that child need food to survive? Or the homeless man outside your door and around the corner, sitting in his rain-soaked cardboard shelter: is food not necessary for his survival? And you say yes, but it's unrealistic to give them my food, for I can't ship my dinner plate without the food spoiling, and plus it would cost too much anyway. And the hobo down the street is high on crack anyway, so he doesn't want my food, and he smells anyway. And I say to you, there, there is your greed. And then you respond, but I give my $85, week-old cardigan to homeless shelters because they have gone out of fashion, and I give $5 to UNICEF on my yearly flight to Cancun, Mexico, where I spend 10 days at a beach resort, forgetting all my worries as I relax in a town where a town a few miles away 80% of the population lives below the poverty line. And I say, there, there is your greed. And you retort, well look at you! Who ever said you were perfect, Mr. All high and mighty, steals from the poor and gives to the rich?! And I say, no one. No one ever said I was perfect, or any different than you. No one said I was the Messiah, no one declared that I stood for all that is good and just. And yet it is I that says, there, there is your greed. And you scream to me, BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME! Do you want me to run out into the rain, and treat the hobo as I would myself, and give him my own food?! Should I vacuum-seal my dinner plate, and ship it to a boy in Mozambique? Should I take the costs out my own paycheck, and send my tax refunds to the homeless shelter half way across town. And I say no. I say no because you are indeed correct, those things are unrealistic. But what do I want from you? I want you to admit that you are greedy, that you are human just like the rest of us, that greed is a key segment of human nature, that you and I are both physical embodiments of greed. AND YOU YELL WITH FRUSTRATION, BUT WHAT DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHY FORMAL CLOTHING WILL EVENTUALLY BURY OUR CULTURE IN A BACKWARDS DOOM OF CHAOS AND CORRUPTION IF IT IS NOT ELIMINATED?! And I say, damn bitch hold your fucking horses, I haven't even gotten to the point yet. Let's recap: society got the idea that t-shirts, baggy pants and fishnets are shabby, rugged and informal from human nature. Human nature is reflected through our actions as humans, and humans are greedy. This means that human nature has a pure element of greed. So how did the greed in human nature define what clothes are considered informal, rugged and shabby? The questions, my dear Watson, is not how the greed in human nature defined certain clothes as informal, rugged and shabby, but rather how the greed in human nature made a separation between formal and shabby, rugged and informal clothing in the first place, and for what purpose. So first we must ask ourselves why the greediness in humans would want to establish a concept of formal and informal clothing. Chew on this: Can greed be greedy for greed? Let me put it in context: a businessman is the head of a relatively large company, with a great deal of capital potential. Let's take the one and only Enron for example. The businessman is the CEO of Enron, the head hancho, the king of the hill, the full Monty, the big lé mooch. However, he lives in a moderate sized house, in a normal, middle-class neighborhood in the city. His kids go to public school and his wife works part time at the local preschool. He is greedy in the sense that he makes sure that he claims enough resources for himself so that he can keep his family living comfortably without many worries, whether those be financial or safety-wise. But at a primal level, greed is always something that strives for more. So let's say that the businessman somehow comes to a point where he is offered a lucrative set of stock options, ones that are sure to have high returns. Now the businessman's primal greed starts to take over. He now wants more money, a more lavish life style, a penthouse downtown, a Bentley and a private jet, a hot secretary to fuck on the side. But in order to get these wishes of his, he must lose his morality and ethics and make decisions that will ruin other people's lives. This is the question: Can the business man's greed actually strive for more greed, so that it can reach those goals, or can the business man's greed be greedy enough to make those decisions on its own? Or can the man's greed be greedy enough to make others greedy for him, and then make the decisions to cover up his ass. Can his greed be greedy at all? Is this question fundamentally flawed? The answer to these questions are open to interpretation, however the bottom line is that the business man has the ability to move from his current moral high ground to the corrupt corporate scoundrel that we all know of. And this is where everything else comes into play. The founders of our society were men like these. And by founders I do not mean our Founding Fathers, no. Thomas Jefferson was long dead by the time our cultures real founders started making changes. The founders of our society were corporate shmucks. They didn't give a hoot about the future, except along the lines of financial prosperity. They wanted more, and they used our society to get it. It was these founders that introduced the ideas that shaped our society's ideas of formal and informal clothing. Why? In order to understand this, we must first understand the affects formal clothing has had on our society. One anomaly that you might have run into already is that formal clothing is not something recent. Formal clothing has been around since the days when feudalism still was the way of the land in Europe, and chivalry was still livin' strong. In reality, formal clothing was even more predominant back then than it is now. But when I say that the idea of formal clothing in our society originated with big business, I mean the new meaning of formal clothing. This meaning, what I shall call the purpose of formal clothing, is what I hate. It is the new purpose of formal clothing, the one created by big business, which has screwed over our culture. Screwed over? What the fuck does he mean by screwed over? What I mean by screwed over is how formal clothing has fundamentally changed how our society functions, and why our culture is only suffering from these changes. Let me break this issue down into 3 easy to swish-and-spit sections: 1.) Past Motives 2.) Present Affects 3.) Future Implications Shall we start in order... Le Numero Uno: Past Motives The motives of the founders of our society not only had many clear and precise long-term goals, they also had a whole slew of short-term objectives that they kept in mind when introducing their new interpretation of formal clothing. What was their interpretation of formal clothing? To them, formal clothing was a tool they could use to manipulate large percentages of the population, and implement new and lasting cultural paradigms. Big business, i.e. the founders of our society, were as smart as they were exploitive. They reshaped our idea of formal clothing not all at once in one large brainwashing scheme, but over a period of time where it would go more or less unnoticed. They introduced their "tool" into American society during key changing points in our culture. The most recent of these introduction periods was during the Great Depression. We all know that big business leased huge sums of money to the government, and in doing so bought themselves a small part of our country. How small? Where? I, ladies and gentlemen, am talking about a 1/8 of the little place we call Washington D.C. They bought power in our government, and used it to make small changes in this country. What were these small changes? That remains a mystery, as only big business knew what they themselves were up too entirely. However, their motives were known. What did they want formal clothing to do for them? First of all, formal clothing could pressure the middle class, as well as the lower classes, into holding themselves to a standard that was set by the upper class. By this I mean that in the old old old days, all the rich people ALWAYS wore formal clothes. There wasn't an alterative. Now, with formal clothing as a required commodity at important functions, people in the lower/middle classes began to hold themselves to this same standard, that only the noble and well off dressed in their formal clothes, and to walk into a ball in jeans and a t-shirt made you look like a "ruffian," a no good lowlife. big business likes this mentality, and they can use it to their advantage. Wait a second, Modesty? What about MTV and whore like... well, whores! Let's travel back in time to a little period called the Elizabethan Era. Now, what was one thing that women did back in this time? They covered their bodies from chin to toe in clothing. Nothing could show, except for the front of the face and MAYBE the hands (gasp!) Why did they do this? Cause previously, people had been runnin' around with their clothes practically flyin off, and modesty was shot to hell. And eventually people became disgusted with it and decided that everything must go: No more public orgies, multiple wives, scantly clad clothing, Michael Jackson... the list goes on. And this created a cycle. Eventually people got mad because of all the conservative influences that were taking the fun out of life, so people started showing more skin again. Now, what is better for a business financially: being able to predict trends in society, or being able to predict trends in society? Not only could the business profit off these trends, they could guarantee that it would happen over and over again! So, you ask, how does formal clothing create this trend? As I said before, formal clothing instilled ideas in our heads of what is and isn’t appropriate in certain situations. Eventually these ideas became intertwined and swing either way, which dictates the current phase of the trend we are in. If the formal clothing idea swings into that of what is informal, then we have a new conservative ear in our culture. If it goes the other way, then sex is in. Now, we all know that adults do not dictate these trends single handedly, no sir-ree. This is where the youth come in. The adults are the people who begin the initial swing, but it is the youth that carries it out. If the youth are liberal horny sex machines, then the adults become more conservative. Since the adults control the government and society, they push a conservative, modest influence into society. Then the adults die off, and the youth become the adults, and their children become the next youth. However the conservative influence remains from the previous adults, the new youth grow up in this conservative lifestyle. Then this generation of youth gets fed up with the censorship, and introduces liberal reforms. This process repeats, and we have the trend that big business profits off of. Let me also get it straight that this trend does not occur as quickly as I just explained it. This cycle repeats maybe once, twice, even possible three times at the most during a century. Big business could still use this to their advantage, by controlling the media to keep the trend going, and even make it stronger. These, my underlings, were the factors that motivated the founders of our culture to introduce their spin on formal clothing. Le Numero Dos: Present Affects I'm scared. Not only am I scared, I am empowered. It is the threat that is currently facing our generation that has empowered me. I cannot sit here, twiddling my thumbs without thinking how fast our culture is going down the toilet, and yet nobody seems to care. Adults Are Oblivious, Children Are Ignorant, politicians are happy. Not All politicians, But The Ones Who Choose To Ignore The Threat Of Our Impending Doom. Our society is in a headlock, crippling under the pressure of Gun-Ho fuckers without a sense of future. Hello, were not in faking Kansas anymore. We never WERE in goddamn Kansas. Fuck Kansas. The word Kansas really looks like a piece of shit word too after you stare at it for a while. Let me indulge you on the current destructive forces milling at our society. We are headed into another turn of the knob. Yes, the other phase of the trend. The omens are everywhere you look: MTV, national thong sales, George Bush, gay marriage, the war in Iraq- these things all add up to one thing; conflict. And when we hit conflict, all goes to hell. We are living in a liberal society for the most part, in terms of cultural ideals. But that is quickly changing. BAMM! The Supreme Court puts George Bush in office. BAMM! Enron collapses. BAMM! 9/11 scares the suburbanites shitless. BAMM! Bush lies to Americans to get revenge on the guy who tried to assassinate his daddy. BAMM! Janet Jackson’s tit falls out during the Super Bowl. BAMM! Clear Channel drops Howard Stern after being fined by the FCC. BAMM! Malpractice insurance rates driving doctors out of business because of frivolous lawsuits. BAMM! Emeril adds some more butter; the U.S. gets fatter. WAKE UP AND SMELL THE GASOLINE FOLKS! Oh wait, THERE ISN'T ANY! We are returning to the Conservative agenda that screwed over our country years ago, and American is just letting it slide right fucking by. Formal Clothing has given a medium for the conservative media to exploit us. FOX NEWS! GETTIN THE CONSERVATIVE BLUES! While the Catholic Church rapes your brother and NOBODY GIVES A SHIT! MAYBE ONCE THEY SEE THE SHIT ON HIS FACE THEY'LL START CARIN'! And Despite these horrible realities, there is still hope. Howard Dean kicked ass, except he wouldn't have gotten elected. Michael Moore is the shiznit, but that whole Disney thing was kinda shabby. WHERE IS RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE WHEN WE NEED THEM! Change is possible, but it takes work, time, balls, guts, Benjamins, and a face. If we don't start making changes soon, then in 60 years when were old and shriveled we'll have to say, "Yep, formal clothing led to the downfall of our society." How pathetic is that. Le Numero Tres: Future Implications The systematic brainwashing of our society led by formal clothing must be stopped. If we do not band together to fight this greater evil, then it will lead our culture into a new Dark Age, where all of the progress we have made in recent years will be lost. How? The Question my underlings is not How is it going to destroy our society, for that is quite obvious. The Question should be, What can we do about it? But considering I’ve already written this much it’ll probably take me a couple more days to explain this part. So instead, I will answer the How questions. How will it lead us into a Dark Age. Let me lay it out for ya'. As our society becomes more conservative, people will begin to where formal clothing everywhere, not just at important functions. So what’s the big deal. you say. The big deal is that suddenly the control factor is gone. Before, big business always dictated the trend of liberalism to conservativism in our culture. But not fashion trends. But you, you say, fashion trends change with current political trends, like how scantly-clad clothes are more popular during liberal times, while turtle necks and collars are more common in conservative times. I say sure, but wait a second. Formal clothing, unlike all other common clothing that we wear today, carries along an impression with it. People think that formal clothing separates them from the rest of the masses, that for the time they are wearing it they suddenly have some higher importance. These ideas have lasted through trends, and do not dissolve. So if formal clothing becomes everyday clothing, then these ideas will become everyday also. But hold up, you say. Why hasn't formal clothing become the dominant choice for common clothing before? Because we never had a chance to stick with it. Think back: World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam. But not Iraq. Why not? Because of terrorism. Terrorism is a threat to our nation that people can't comprehend, so instead they leave it up to their leaders. Mr. President, why is my daddy dead? Because he realized how great his country was, and that he was willing to do anything to make sure that the people of his country and you would live better lives. But why is he dead Mr. President? I don’t understand. Well son, your dad was fighting some very bad, evil people. These people threatened this country. They threatened him, her, them, this people of this city, of this entire country- and you. And you were the most important thing to him, so he decided to fight to the end, just for you. But whom was he fighting? People who hate freedom son, people who don't understand what is so great about life here in America. Where are they? Did he make them go away? Well son, these people are everywhere, and your dad was fighting a group of them. There are so many, that this country has to draft your older brother to fight too. Just for you, son. Just for you. but when will they go away Mr. President, when? When they realize how great freedom is. That's when. And when will that be? Soon son, soon. What can I do to help? Ha-ha, well your only 5. You'll have to wait another 13 years if you want to enlist. But when your old enough, I'm sure you'll know what the right thing to do is. But what can I do now? I wanna to help now! Stay alert son! If you see anything that doesn’t look right, then tell an adult. Do your part now, and you could save millions of people lives, just like your dad. Gee thanks Mr. President! I almost forgot that my dad died in a war that didn't have a clear enemy, goal or purpose! I can't wait to sacrifice my life for a lying, manipulating bastard like yourself when I'm old enough! But until then, I'll just pretend I live in late 18th century France and your Maximilien Robespierre, and instead of this being the War on Terror, it's the Reign of Terror! And its my job as a responsible citizen to make sure I tell the government whenever some talks bad about you, Mr. President, because your just a good person and they don't believe in freedom if they don't like you! I love my country! Do you want the next youth generation to grow up like this? In our modern world, when people willingly decided to do stupid shit like this, and embrace conservative values, formal clothing reign supreme. It will rise up, unstoppable because it is imposed on our society not by big business, which can moderate it, but by ourselves. If formal clothing becomes commonplace, so will conservative values. The Church will gain power, scientific progress will end, and military progress will proceed. The remnants of the fun culture that we lived by, the truly free culture, will all but disappear. And society will pause in progress, and begin to reverse. Everything that we learned, our computer technology, our world connectivity, our world languages, our writing, our knowledge, our freedom, will undo itself. We will forget everything, leaving nothing but uniformity and a homogenous society. The freedom that we attempted to preserve will be gone. Nothingness will become everything. This, ladies and gentle men, I call the Tivo Affect. I have shown you how formal clothing came about as a tool of big business in our culture, how it affects us today, and how it is gradually unwinding the delicate thread of our civilization. And if I could replace the mindset that governs formal clothing in the brains of people, I would replace it with this new logic: End the homogeneousness. Do not strive to be the same; leap to be different. Embrace the eccentric, outcast the followers. Do not call people Posers, cause the only Posers are the people that call people Posers (-the words of Mark Gonzales). Individuality is the answer, not the reject idea. Fuck the stiff. Love the new. And don't forget to pimp out in those penguin tuxes.
I have had a semi-epiphany. Now your probably thinking that this is just another one of my shitty ideas but this is different, coz' it ain't an idea about a project. At least not really. It's an idea about the ideas I have for projects. What is the one problem that I ALWAYS have when it comes to projects? The lack of funding. I have no cash for this shit. This is what my semi-epiphany is about. I don't like to restrict myself, so previously I have avoided setting any perameters for what I can and cannot do. This time however, I'm giving myself one tinsy winsy restriction: a budget. This time the sky ain't the limit in the financial department. From now on I will be working only on stuff that is very cost efficient and organized. This is completely different from what I've done before. Here's my issue: because of my new restriction, I will have to put all of my previous projects on indefinite hold. These include but are not limited to: The Pimped out, rocket/motorcycle engine powered Radio Flyer The Pirate Radio Station Turning my upper deck into a Pirate ship (see above) Making my room the epicenter of Modern design and counterculture Transforming into the Urban Cowboy Although I am sad that I have to put these projects on hold, I'm glad that I have a new path and frontier to conquer, and a fresh start to keep me motivated. In the words of Monster Garages Jesse James: "Damn, that's bitchin'."
So John Kerry gave his speech last night at the Democratic National Convention, and I must say that he was alright. He didn't let the crowd clap enough, which may have hurt him. He did have lots of really good quotes though, and those should help him in the fall. Here is my ranking of the best speeches given at this year's DNC: Barack Obama Good speech, appealed to a broad audiance, performed under pressure; very good keynote address Hillary Clinton Not the most important speech, but a very, very good one; even though she was just introducing someone, she managed to bring up many good points Al Sharpton Not only the funniest speech I saw, it was probably the most motivating, in a weird, Al Sharpton-type of way; he combind preachy-volume and buildup with harsh critisism of Bush- just what the doctor ordered

Tropicana Pink Lemonade = Pure Shit They call this a liquid?! It's fucking sugar! And I don't mean liquid sugar either, I mean real whole solid sugar; I felt it in my mouth. Now that is just not right. I started sweating after I had two sips, even though it's caffeine free, non-carbonated, and I wasn't on eBay. Speaking of pure shit, I saw "The Rundown" with the Rock today and it sucked almost as much. Semi-cliches are the next big thing. News Flash: If we had better space program, then we could get rid of all of our Nuclear waste easy, but instead we have to put it in some mountain for 10,000 years. Not to mention transport it through Chicago. Quick Tip: IKEA is great cause they have modern furniture and Swedish meatballs. Everything I need to forget I'm in America for 3 hours. I Need to play poker. I haven't played in fricken forever. When we seein' Will Smith?
Check out the Stuff page, its got News for the New. I need to get that webcam... best part about it is that I can take it anywhere where theres a net connection and still upload it to the site. That means I could hide it in someones house and watch them eat dinner. Or watch people in Starbucks. Or I we could have battles and turn em into a web-show. We could build forts and shit. And Catapults! NEW IDEA: A MOCK WARFARE LEAGUE! We have people make teams and then they get to spend one day making their fort on a field with the other teams. They would be evenly spaced apart. Then the next day they would do battle, and the team with the last fort standing wins.
If Competence is in the eye of the beholder, then this world is truely not controlled by anyone. Not that it ever was or is today, but the whole idea of any one person or group having control over a large amount of something that isn't their's is fundamentaly flawed. As of matter of fact, control itself is meaningless. This is no epiphany, but think about it. If someone says they control the town over there, where towns people live and do business, what puts them in control. If someone twists your arm and tells you to suck it, or puts a gun to your head and tells you to give 'em the money, how are they in control. If it was your life plan to be robbed, wouldn't you be then in control, by being able to munipulate life events and control them so that you eventually are mugged? Control is like many other ideas that make up our society: meaningless, powerful and efficent. Why do I bring this up? Cause it popped into my head. The Radio Flyer may very well become one of my life's great works. Most likely my life's only great work. And it is indeed Great. Pointless shmucks can't compete. QUESTION: Am I the only person of the people who read this that dosen't wear jeans or denim in general? I can't stand jeans, coz' they never fit and are stiff as hell, not to mention heavy. Khakis kick ass. They are flexible, light weight, and I couldn't care less if they get dirty. Jeans on the other hand naturaly look dirty, so they need to be constantly washed. Dirt enhances Khakis, and accents their already stylin' selves. I bring this up because I want to get a pair of batwing chaps for the holidays, and being classic Cowboy wear, they look better when worn with jeans. So I will have to break this paradigm, and become the Khakin Cowboy, Urban Defender of the Undefended! Regrets: The lassoing bet is off cause I have other more important matters to pursue, mainly being the Radio Flyer and getting in shape. If anyone has a problem with that, then I shall challenge them to a one-on-one duel.
Roundtrip ticket to Grandparent's house: $138 Gas money for 8 passenger Minivan: $49 Two nights in Best Suites Hotel: $73 Wedding gift with card: $405 200 Republican relatives with nothing to talk about: Priceless Some things money can't buy. But Hell on Earth sure isn't one of them. Ahh, the joys of childhood. John Kerry has picked John Edwards as his running mate, and already Fox News has people commenting on their possible homosexual relationship. I have final realized how destructive politics are in this country. Politics make this country weak by dividing us, and that is why this nation is suffering. Countries can achieve great things when united, or fuck up really bad when not. Rush Limbaugh makes me sick. So does the flu. Once upon a time, there was a little duck. One day, this duck went to see his uncle. When he saw his uncle outside his house fishing, the duck quacked, "Uncle!" The little duck's uncle looked up and saw his nephew, and greeted him with open wings. Then a hunter shot the uncle. And so the little duck ran back to his home and called the FBI. Soon a crime seen was setup where the shooting had occured. Apparently this was not the first shooting, and the FBI was already hot on the tail of the renegade hunter. And so the FBI asked Congress to pass a bill that would require all citizens to have an I.D. card, that they must carry with them at all times. This way, the FBI could track down the hunter easier. Soon the FBI needed mroe help, and called the CIA. They put a spending bill through Congress as part of the Department of Defenses "Black Budget" that would allow them to tap and record all phone, mail, and electronic forms of communication without authorization. Soon the FBI caught the hunter, and publicised the story widely, to gain public support for the agency. However, even though renegade hunters were not at large and crime rates were down to an all time low, the FBI and CIA asked Congress to repass the old bills. Congress did as they were told, fearing that questioning the bill would cause them to loose public support in the next election. And so the little duck grew old, and soon he became an uncle as well. But he was run over by a semi on I-94, and was squashed like a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich in a second graders lunch. Weather is weather. No getting around it. I'm done with that shit. I was stuck on the god damn plane for an hour because of a rain delay from a thunderstorm. Fat toes- don't need rings. Words of California's biggest J-E-L-L-O fan, the one and only Mr. P. Radio Flyer Update: I'm working on the chassis right now, trying to incorporate different aspects of the Radio Flyer body and design. This will most likely be the second longest phase, next to building it. Once I finish the main designs I'll need a drafter to help me clean 'em up. Right now we cannot and will not call this a go kart. Why? Because a Radio Flyer deserves better. Way better.
I'm in Michigain, so thats why I haven't written in a while. I officially am scared of WalMart. The people in that place give me the heeby-jeebies. I've met more republicans that want to destroy free speech for liberals while thinking that they are fighting for freedom by supporting the war than I ever want to meet again unless I'm drunk as a skunk and need a fight to pick with a pitch fork and a launtern. Speaking of lawnmowers, I took apart one two days before tommorow's yesterday, and put it back together. And it ran. Very very well. So well that I have been inspired (you know where this is going) to begin another project, by reviving an old one. Yes ladies and gents, THE RADIO FLYER HAS RETURNED! Instead of it being rocket powered however, it will use a lawnmower engine. It might even be finished in time for Mexican Independence Day! I have many stories to tell when I return home, which will be on the 18th I believe, ranging from kick ass relatives to non-kick ass cleaning ladies. I hate to do admit it, but for the time being, meaning TEMPORARILY, I do have a [the crowd cringes] cell phone. If anyone happens to have an emergency requiring aid concering nail polich to carburators, please descretely drop me a line at 773-314-6608. You can also e-mail me at 7733146608@vmobl.com
It's 9:00am Friday morning, and I am minutes away from leaving for my grandparent 40-something year wedding anniversery, which also happens to be a family reunion. Not only are people not even part of the family coming - my cousin Hanika from my dad's side - but there will be a deluge of political tension. Which is a bad thing. A very bad thing. I'll be back from the front lines on tuesday. Next topic. When I come back, I will be dissecting the Motorola Ultra Classic phone that has come into my possesion. I will also attempt to either a.) take apart "the phone" and remove its SIM card and try to put it in the old Motorola, and switch the service, or b.) replace the innards of the Motorola with those of "the phone." Either way, when it's I'mza gonna need some help pimpin' out this phone, aka. fur coating with a horn and a beer-mug handle. Anyone with any artistic/manic depressive qualities please contact me or be contacted by a contactor who is contacting. Here's some info on the phone itself: Motorola Ultra Classic Series MSN: 783GUQ1408 APC: 783 Manufactuing Location: G - Libertyville, IL Year of Production: U - 1994 Month of Production: Q - August Serial Number: 1408 Model Number: F09QYD8337BG FCC ID: IHDT5QV2 832/2412 Battery info Nickel Cadmium (Ni-Cd) Battery Pack 7.2 Volts; 1500 mAh Made for: Motorola 8000/9000/9800 Serial Number AO: 024031
YES! CHEAP NEVER FELT SO GOOD! I have a purpose: to take the spirit of the Radio Flyer and combind it with existing parts to create the embodiment of my forward thinking and progress. Two words: Bar Stool Yes Ladies and Gentlemen, a rolling bar stool. Bask in its glory.
omg i think a yr 6 is fit.. thats dirt.. and I fancy someone in lower 6th now but you'll have to ask me about that one.. I am v. annoyed/confused at the moment.. grr.. cant write about it tho so I'm gonna have to talk to someone about it.. omg I had a nightmsre about muriel last night.. not even funny.. i went mad!!
OMG. I am so unbelievably p**s*d off.. seriously I'm gonna go mad soon. Certain people in my year are so out of order its not even funny.. some people think they can tell me what to do.. dunno how that works. I've just been informed (to my face aswell) that I am up myself because I said that without me and charlotte (the two strongest girls in our year) doing the tug of war they were pretty screwd. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. and a certain person (ask me about that... not writing down any names in case someone unwelcome is reading this..) seems to think that they are some bl**dy genious who should really be in set 1 for everything (their set 4 ratio is v. v. high) and that she is in fact ,uch cleverer than she really is.. o and did I forget to mention talented in every way... grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr I'm so angry. anyway i have to go and write some sh***y report that I have been ordered to write by... yes thats right one of my friends.. grrrrrrr omg I'm such a b***h
Ok, ao the exams are over.. I guess thats kinda good, but now looking back I wish I hadnt been so lazy and I'd actually bothered to revise. Oh well... cant change the past so I guess I'm gonna have to learn from my mistakes. anyway, tje most positive aspects of my life are the moment are; 1. the exams are over. 2. lucy. There arent anymore. I've discovered that i can't communicate through words.. I have to either write down my thoughts or put them on here. People seem to think that I am really hard and that I can cope with anything.. but being completely honest, I cant.. its all an act. I know I joke about my experiences with counselling and seem reluctant to go, but before I actually went I was full of hope because I thought that maybe this would be the way to sort me out. Now I know it hasnt worked and I dont know where to go from here. I am stuck on a downwards spiral and I cant get out of it, because I dont know how.I thoguht counselling might help me but it didnt so now I'm all out of hope. At the moment I feel as though I dont actually have any true friends.. I get on with alot of people because I have to.. I'm not going any further in to it (christie this doesnt include you, I get on with you because i want to). I feel as though noone really cares about me anymore. Everyone thinks I've got past it, but I havnt, it gets worse and worse every day. Everyone around me seems to be so happy all the time, so I pretend to avoid bringing others down. i bottle everything up so everyone thinks I'm ok, but deep down it hurts so much. Noone seems to realise that I am puttin gon this huge act so that people like me. People are only interested in the old kaz who was always making jokes and having fun, and i am trying so hard to be like that, but I always know that deep down thats not how i'm feeling. It's like I'm hiding behind a mask and noone can see behind it, and hardly anyone even realises its there. I cant talk about it properly because I find it really hard to get the words out. I hate pretending all the time. I feel so alone, like noone understands me. Sometimes I have to get out of my room because i am so scared of what I might do to myself if i stay there any longer. had a huge argumet with christie but i think thats on its way to being sorted out and its going to make our friendship alot stronger. instead of talking to anyone about it though, I took it out on myself. I dont know why i do it though. I get this thought in my head andI have to do it. i have to punish myself for being such an idiot. I dont know why, I just cant help it.I know i need to do something about it, but counselling didnt work, and now I'm all out of ideas. I am stuck here in this time of my life and i cant see the end of it. I cant see there being a future.. itjust seems as though i'm never gonna be who I used to be again. I hate who I am at the moment more than I hate muriel and thats saying something gotta go
I have just come back from athletics... running up and down the astro non stop for, what... bout 20 mins... not really my idea of fun... anyhow, i've been rather p****d off today... had an argument with christie, and as you are probably reading this, I would like to take this oppertunity to appologise for my behaviour... i know i can be a prize k**b at times and I'd like to appologise for that. However, I would still like you to take in to account what I said as it does upset me. Anyway... I have succesfully failed all of my exams... except maybe french... music tomorrow, and latin... anyone know anything about Sagae Thesalae that they would care to share with me??... he he, that reminds me of miss simpsons lessons... when talking about covalent bonding... now children.. they're caring sharing electron.. (see me if you want to see my impression... its not so funny written down.. bit like achoo!) love you all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ok, i go bored of pink... S*** colour!!!!!! Had my french exam this morning... went quite well apart from the oral.. so I may be accustommed to sitting in locked rooms with nasty men, ( this time it was compulsory and consential) but still... i did alot of ummnns and ers... oh well! Maths this afternoon... we get a harder paper than everyone else which is a b**** .. (yes I'm in the maths club... get the jokes over with!!) oh well better go revise... Are you guys impressed thats 5 lines of writing and I havnt even mentioned lucy yet...!!!
Just come back from chapel... v. boring lecture on homeless people... nearly fell asleep, and that was meant to be brief?!?!? Anyway, wasnt really what I needed having just walked 16 miles in two days, and camping over night. D of E is in fact a nightmare, and so conveniently placed... the weekend before our exams... fantastic. When I got back discovered 5 texts and 7 missed calls, most of which were from lucy. She was kinda wondrin why I hadnt answered my phone for two days! Anyway, having sweet talked my way out of that one, she is once again happy with me!!!!!!!!!! She was taking the p*** about me and my sex life which i thought was rather rude!! Anywayz, I talk about her too much!!! Having not checked my email since friday night, I sat down at the computer happily expecting a few emails... my inbox was in fact empty!!!! anyway i'm off... laterz
He he... I thought it would be quite funny to have a pink background...!!! Had quite a good day today although I was annoyed that I only got 21 out of 25 on my performance :-( o well it was fat peter so he critisised me more coz he knows bout the french horn... o well lifes a bitch then you die so f*** it all and lets get high!!! I love Lucy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! gtg to lessons now c ya
I am once again happy, despite muriels best attempts to piss me off so much that i go mad! one downer was that i had an argument with charlie... but i think that can be sorted. Anyway for those who were wondering what has made me so happy... apart from those lesbianic rumblings going on in jenni's room...! I will inform you. As you may know (well, as you do know as I have already mentioned this in one of my previous thingies) yesterday, I got through some pictures of my girlfriend lucy.. Now, having inspected them for a very long time, I have decided that (apart from being a bit of a kev) she is quite cute and that I love her more and more every day!!!! Noone believes me when I say I love her but I do... step aside miss belcher, you are no longer top of my list!!!!! la di da di da... ok... enough about lucy although I could talk about her endlessly!!! :-) i need to put some pics on my blog........ how does one do that??!!! If anyone wants to see the pictures they only have to ask!! I will be happy to show you and talk about it for hours on end.... I've been playing my guitar... v. relaxing... suddenly felt the need to come and write in my blog! 5 in a day... I think I am becoming obsessed with my blog, so i am going to resist writing anymore... I'm off to moisturise my legs and play the guitar some more... oh and Deya "Who's so phoney, always surrounded? stop your screaming - noone can hear. The scars on your skin 'post no bills'.. who you were, was so beautiful, remember who you were. Hide from the mirror - the cracks and memories. Hide from your family - they wont know you now. For all the holes in our souls hots no thrills. Who you were, was so beautiful. Memories who - Who you were" I love you... remember that xxxxxxxxxxx
That... was shit. I'm not doing another sesion. I'm sorry Jen I know you want me to but I can't`. I just feel as though she is trying to get inside my brain, which admittedly is what she's meant to do. but i dont want her there. I feel as though she only wants to talk to me so that she can nose into my life... I kno thats not true because she is just doing her job. i dont like her asking me personal questions about my life.. she doesnt need to kno. i just want to forget about most of it, unless i'm thinking about it and then i just talk it through with one of my freinds (i love you guys) and then its fine... i mean, these sesions make me think about it when i dont want to. i hate it.. at the moment i feel as though mrs marshall is actually my mum, i mean, i dont have a good relationship with my mum, partly because she's normally to pissed to talk to me, but i cant talk to her at all... mrs marshall is always there, she gives me hugs, great advise, which is exactly what i need, but dont seem to be able to get... does anyone else have a shit relationship with their parents... how do you deal with it??? to add to it i've lost one of my best friends... henry, for those who dont know about that, he sent me an email saying that I wave my arm around for attention.. on the contrary (i threw that in for you jen!) i cut myself on my upper arms or on my leg so that noone can see.... dont really understand how that is attention seeking.. one of his other points was that apparently I'm saying that I am a lesbian for attention aswell... He thinks i should tell every guy i fancy about that... I mean we are talking little crushes... or more like, I'm pretending to like them to cover up my true sexuality... I'm not gonna bloody marry them for fucks sake!!! so i got really pissed off by him and now we are no longer friends.. bit silly if you ask me to throw away a friendship that has been going on for years... oh well. i guess its kinda his loss not mine. couldn't give a shit about anything anymore.. i wanna curl up and die.. maybe thats a bit extreme but thats how it feels at the moment... gtg save christie from wierdos in the computer centre laterz xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i dont bloody wanna go. Its not even funny. So yeh I joke about her and say she is fat and ginger etc, but now i've actually got to go and talk to her. its so awkard being in a room with someone that you dont even know for a whole hour.. i cant stand it, I dont need counselling.. fucking hell... there is nothing i can do to get out of it, without either really upsetting mrs marshall or getting expelled.. shit shit shit shit shit. i'm gonna go mad..... shit. i need to talk to someone... I FUCKING HATE LIFE. seriously... i'm bloody scared...
I've discovered over the past week that I am OBSESSED with muse... (well they are amazing). I am also finding it difficult to go for 5 mins without looking at my blog or someone elses... v. worrying! at least i'm getting it all out i guess. My favourite muse song by far has to be screenager... listen to it again anyone who's reading this... how amazing is his voice?! Deya... I dont mean this to be offensive but you really need to listen to the lyrics.. I think they are true of you... (does that make sense?) Dont take that badly please!!! I think that you would understand what I am trying to say to you through the words of Muse.. plus you can't shout backat me!!! just remember I'm always here and I love you.. xxx Oh yeh... just while I remember... thanks for everything Jenni... I know I probably get annoying after a bit, but thank for letting me talk to you etc.. you're a legend. Especially thanks for coming to see Mrs M with me... it cant have been nice for you either xxx I love you all!! (but i love luce more!!!) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
This didn't work last time, so once again I'm going to write about my sad little life!!!! Having discovered blogs yesterday, I found that Jenni was right (as normal)a blog is a really good way to sort your life out so to speak. I am having quite a good day today... maths with megahey, exhilerating as always!! Anyway....... I've been quite happy this week due to getting back with Luce!!! Got some pictures through of her yesterday aswell, so if I've got a permanent smile on my face thats why!! On the bad side tho I have fallen out with henry pretty much for good, which really got me down. I take it out on myself... shouldnt do that. Need to stop with the whole self harm thing. Anyway.. I'm really worried about Deya... come and talk to me any time mate... noone will be told (except maybe muriel..!!!) Ahhhh counselling today.... I'm really worried about it.. I dont like it!! grrr...4words ginger scottish fat muriel! Another thing I've had on my mind but never really talked to anyone about (except Katie the gappy... legend!) is my faith in god.... sounds silly i kno.. but over the past however long, I have been doubting god... my theory; I am a Christian, yet there are people that aren't, and they get easy lives... doesnt really seem fair... so I kinda thought well maybe there isnt a god.. but having been a christian all my life (too many lessons with stevo soz!) I never really tried to admit this to my mum or my sister coz they would have gone mad!! but I kinda think I do believe in god, kind of because I'm scared not to (devil and all that)... and after long chats with katie, I have decided that I do believe and started praying etc again... any thoughts on that??? better go anyway, I meant to be practicing!! laterz
as those of you who i could give two shits about will know, I will no longer be using this blog anymore, and if I want you to see my new one, I'll probably have given you my new address. Sorry christie, I dont want you knowing anything about me anymore.
Hi everyone Well, Luke, you've guilt tripped me into updating you, and everyone else, as to what's going on in my life right now. Where to start? I guess chronologically... This sunday will mark two weeks since I bought a laptop. I've been wanting one for a long time, and I got a sweet deal on a Toshiba A65-S126 package. I got the laptop, a "free" Lexmark Z715 printer, a "free" laptop carry bag and a "free" 256 MB RAM upgrade in the deal. The following monday, I came to work and jinxed myself. I said to my coworker: "Watch, now that I spent a good chunk of money on a laptop, something's going to happen to my car...the engine's going to blow, or something, I just know it." -- I'm not joking, I said this. Now, on to my car, or should I say my old car. It got crunched on friday the 13th arond 8:30pm by a 2002 Ford Pick-up. I'll try to upload a pic below (when I get home from work) for those who haven't seen one yet. It's been declared a total loss. They estimated about 4000 in damages...Mel and I were/are ok. Just some sore necks and backs for a few days. We were driving on a road about to make a left hand turn. Two lane road, no traffic lights, no oncoming traffic, no stop sign, 55 mph speed limit, double yellow line down the middle. Mel slows to make the left hand turn, the car behind slows down with us, the pick up behind the car was lighting his cigarette. He looked up, realized he was going to rear-end the car in between us, and jerked his truck into the oncoming traffic lane. Well, we were still in the process of turning. He crunched the driver's side, back quarter panel, from the tire to a few inches beside the license plate on the back, and spun us around into the grass. We had no idea what happened...anyways, the picture should help with my explanation. As far as I know, he ended up with a cracked grill. Maybe a dent or two on his bumper, I didn't look at his truck after the accident. Anyone know anyone who's selling a 98 or 99 eclipse GST or GSX? :) And the third bit of news I have is that I am being flown to Raleigh, North Carolina for a job interview this coming Wednesday. I fly out of rochester at 6am, and return to rochester at 10pm the same day. The company is Aeroglide Corporation. The job is for an Electrical Engineer, designing and drafting electrical control panels for their systems, as well as programming PLCs (programmable logic controllers) and some other minor EE things. I'm excited, I hope it goes well. I think I'm the favourite for the job - that's what the recruiter tells me at least. I'll keep you all updated. (This blog beats sending numerous emails!) Well, time to get back to pretending to work... Jon
Hey everyone, I am off to the arctic again. I will be leaving Kingston at 0500 on Saturday August 21st, and returning on the 4th of September. This time I am going to a site called FOX Main, which is located at Hall Beach. In the map below you can see Hall Beach directly below the second U in the word Nunavut. I will try to keep in contact and let you guys know how I am doing. Apparently there is a pool table and a sauna and a workout room, so I will try to work on my hand eye coordination and get buff in the short time that I will be there. I may need that workout room, because from everything everyone is telling me, the food there is amazing and fattening, so I could be in trouble. Oh well, I hope everyone is doing well. Talk to you all again soon
Look at me, I'm bloggin now....yup that's me, bloggin in barrie, i'm a barrie blog bloggin blog blog...in barrie..................blog.
well, here is the first posting. I kept seeing things on the internet about blogs and not having a clue what they were so I looked into it. This one is through google, so it should be quality. Anyway, it is a place that you can write thoughts, share information, links, pictures, anything. I figured it would be cool to set this up for anyone and everyone that has lived at/stayed at 515 Johnson, as well as family, friends, significant others, et cetera to keep in contact and keep up to date and to share information and pictures, and links and all the rest of it.
Courtney is saying "duh" right now, but I didn't know where this word came from. To make a long story short: say "Web log" out loud. There you go, blog became a word.
urlLink Olympics - CBC.ca - Athens 2004 Let's all keep up to date with how Canada is doing at the Olympics
Courtesy of amazon.com urlLink http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23XAQZSH8FW3/ref=cm_cr_auth/104-5475061-4230353 The Third Album was supposed to be the triumphal, world-conquering follow-up to "Rio". Instead it comes across as over-produced smarmy pop with an overblown title and bad cover art to boot. This is the one D2 album I hardly ever listen to. "The Reflex" is a promising start, but fair warning, the album mix is distinctly different from the Nile Rodgers produced single remix that hit #1 on the charts. "New Moon On Monday" is okay, but then the tracks descend into insincere pop inanity. "Cracks in the Pavement" and "I take the Dice" are pure pablum filler. Side one grinds to a close with "Of Crime And Passion", a song trying so hard to be edgy it ultimately spins off the 'ol turntable. "Union of the Snake" is solid chart material, the strongest song with a solid Bowie bass beat, excellent percussion and some good horn work. "Shadows On Your Side" comes off as an overdone uptempo number that seems to get to the chorus inside of 10 seconds and repeat it every 30 seconds thereafter. The band finally take a breath and stretch their creativity on "Tiger Tiger", an evocative instrumental number that leads in to the big finish "The Seventh Stranger", which is one of my favorite ballad/atmospheric numbers from the band, and Andy Taylor's guitar solo theme work is gorgeous. The album ends abruptly, far short of it's intended goal. This album needs a serious "Director's Cut" style updating from Nick and Simon to bring it back to respectability. If they had included the "Is There Something I Should Know" single, the outstanding B-side "Secret Oktober" and the remixed single version of "The Reflex" they might have had something. Buy this version only if you have to have it to complete your collection. And that's The Bottom Line
Saw "The Bourne Supremacy" tonight. I'd give it a solid 3 stars. Matt Damon continues to impress in his most "meaty" role to date as Jason Bourne; half lost soul, half trained killer. Damon does an excellent job of balancing the duality of his character and the stresses it places on Bourne's psyche. Joan Allen gives a good supporting performance as a CIA director who is hunting Bourne. Without giving away any major plot points, The Bourne Supremacy features a soild cast, good plotting, great action scenes (especially a tunnel chase sequence near the end of the film), great locations (Berlin, Moscow, India) and just enough character advancement to keep me entertained and engaged throughout. Well worth the full ride fare to see it in theaters. And that's The Bottom Line

I've started working out, again. I really do not like to work out. It takes too much time. Gimme a pill, you know. But now that I'm 40, I think it is important to take care of this body since its the only one I get. Even days are for strength training, odd ones are cardio. Bleh, cardio, my least favorite of the whole scheme. I'm forcing myself to do it, though. Trying to get back to where I'm addicted to it again. I move in such extremes. I used to live to work out. Then I quit after some guy at the swap meet called me a freak because I had some pretty well-developed muscles. Later on in years I tried to begin again and that man's face would swim into my sweaty vision and I'd lose steam. Funny. I've forgotten his face now. I don't remember what he looked like, but I can still hear that word sort of muttered in my general direction. "Freak." Oh well, I gotta do.... I wanted to blog a bit about my faith. I'm proud to be Pagan under the watchful, caring, sweet calm umbrella of the Great Mother. Earth. Shakespeare said something like: Let the forest be my guide. I'll find my books in the running brooks, let the squirrels and foxes be my teachers. (I'll look it up and post the correct quote later.) That's what I believe. It's what I've always believed, really. I understood, at an early age, the interrelationship between man and the universe. I sometimes find it hard to come to terms with the way most people conduct their lives every day without thought for what the earth and universe does for us or what it means to be a part of this magnificent, awesome process called our world. How do they do it? How did I do it for so many years. I've come home. I wanted to describe the feeling I have about finding this faith, but each time I attempt to put it into words I'm dumbstruck for the right ones. Though I'm a solitary, it was and is always fantastic to find that others feel the same as me. In fact, there are thousands who feel this way. There is this world, this collective consciousness of which I have only recently become aware. I had forgotten to listen to the inner me and let that remembered faith guide me. I do remember. I am remembering more every day.
6-19-2004 I've been looking to hook up with some of my old high school friends, of which there are few! I'm looking for Sandra Nichols and Velvet Houchins who with me graduated Fulton High School in 1982,in Fulton, MO. If anyone reads this and knows anything about them, please feel free to contact me @ boyntonrestoration@juno.com . I'll post more bloggish type stuff next time.

Wow...today was an eventful day...Not really. I barely talked to David :( Deeann isnt moving in with Ian until her birthday, but they did stay together last night, and she sounded like she was so happy...they are gonna be so happy living together! I talked to Dustin and Micheal some more today...Jessica's home!! Thank gosh!! I was about to go crazy! Its kinda storming right now...I really don't like stormy weather, ever since the wreck thunder frightens me. Where is David...I miss him. I'm head over heals over that boy, I love him so much...ah...he has won my heart. I think that Dustin and his band are really gonna go far, Dustin has a great voice and can really play the guitar...all they need is a Drummer...lol! Music I'm listening to now: I'm moving on By: Rascal Flatts Thats a really great song. Tomorow I am going up to the school to work ojn some of my make up work...Especially biology. And to get my review sheets...Whitesboro is really bad about getting your work to you when you ask for it. I mean Mrs. Cheney told me that she would get reviews from all my classes and give them to David but did she? NO...he only got one and I already had that one!! They did the same thing to me right after the wreck. My mood right now: Longing...I miss David...but I'm also in a good mood...that just generally is me tho...lol Back to my day...hopefully David will come over before work tomorow, and on break tomorow...Erik is home today! I don't know where hes been but its definately been different without him on the net all the time, Cuz I talk to him about alot of stuff. Ive been wondering where Tim is?! TIM WHERE ARE YOU!?! I really wanna get out...go to the pool...go somewhere...I cant stand being at home all day every day and I cant see how anyone can do that!! AH I might get to be in a band! Victor Smith(excuse me if I spelled anything wrong in that) is going to give me violin lessons, as yall know I already play, but he's givin me lessons so I can get better. And his band is looking for a singer, so of course my mom told him that I sing and he wants to hear me sing!! How awesome is that? This is like a once in a lifetime chance, well not really cuz I'm sure if i wanted to I could be in Dustin and Micheal's band!! I wish David would call me back!! Grrr... Dont you hate it when guys do that...GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!! Guys confuse me at times...lol. "I'm full of fly shit"--Dustin Mozingo Thats one of the famous quotes of this day...not really its just a really funny story behind it. Its back to the doctor for me on thursday...which I really cant wait cuz once mama sees that my results are negative i can go out and have fun!! That is until I have the surgery...wow this has been a long post...If any thing eventful happens tonight, I'll come write another one for today...Love yall!!
I am bored and I'm gonna tell ya about my day yesterday... Well...my day started off with me talking to Deeann on the phone for a while...She was moving all her stuff that she had packed the night before out in the yard so when Ian came they could just load it up and go. Then, I was on the net for a while and David got on and read the email that i wrote him...it was a very long one. So then later yesterday afternoon David came over! He suprised me...lol I was actually in my room trying to call him when he drove up!! We had alot of fun and he soaked me with my squirt bottle so to get him back i spray painted his hair orange and black and gold! hahaha! We went outside and played football and did some other stuff;)I can't wait until next school year, so that we can go out again, Because I Really LOVE David. So then, David left and Dustin and Micheal called me...lol which really shocked me cuz I didnt think they were ever gonna call me! I talked to them for a while and I talked to David for a little bit on the phone and then I talked to Dustin and Micheal some more and then...Deeann came over!! I got to see her and I also got to see Ian and Ross...Its been a while since I saw Ross seeing as he lives in Celina! So after they left I got back on the phone with Dustin and Micheal and Dustin ate a fly...lol those boys are crazy!! Then I called David and we talked for about an hour or so, which was the longest we've talked in a long time, and then I got sleeepy and went to bed. During the course of yesterday I really upset Zach, which, I'm sorry about that, but I dont want to take back anything that I said to him. Oh and WAY TO GO CALVIN!! He got a 1 at state! And Jessica you need to get ur BOOTAY home...I gots stuff to tell ya CHIKA!!! Oh and DeeAnn..I miss ya already....YOU BETTER CALL ME ASAP!!!
Wow! I have a "blog" now! This is kinda cool I guess...ah...Here's to another boring day at home...I wish we still had school, being home all day long is BORING. and then with me about to have surgery, its gonna be crazay, no goin to the pool...no hangin out with friends...just me...home...all day...HOLY POOP IM GONNA HAVE A BORING SUMMER!! That, and David is going to Arkansas for a week:( which isnt cool at all...Well..this is all I'm gonna write for now...Ill write more tonight
This is Crazy....Ive been so bored...no one has been home...GRRRR ppl...Today was one of those days where you just want to sleep all day. I didn't get to talk to David today...*sniff*Sniff* He leaves for Arkansas tomorow!! That means I have to wait a week before I get to talk to him again! Everyone is going away on Vacation and its crazy...No one here to talk to! Finally tomorow I am going to the Doctor and he better say that I'm better or else!! I'm serious!so... MY DAY Well someone called at 3am and woke me up 3 times...which I got mad cuz I was sleepin. DARN YOU! and then Of course I got woken up at 7:30 when Debbie brought Maggie over. I went back to sleep and got woken up again when Dee called me at 9 ish and then the DANG street sweeper came at like 11:00 and woke me up again! So I'm kinda cranky cuz I didnt get much sleep! ARG! So then I talked to DeeAnn and we talked for a little bit...Nothing eventful really...the Cat has been coming around me more lately..I think shes jealous of Maggie...cuz When the baby is over here She doesnt get any attention from Heidi so...Man I'm in love and I dont have the person that I love around me...of course you know the object of my affection is David Alan Hunter...and I will never ever ever lose my love for him...holy poop I love him alot. Well this evening it stormed and ever since the wreck I've been afraid of thunder so I was off to myself in my room while it was storming...Man I really have a boring life...I want to go see Harry Potter on Friday, but I have NO one to go with...which sucks. Hopefully David and I are still going to go see the day after tomorow cuz i really want to see it!!Anyways it finally quit storming, and I finally got to get back on here. But thats about all I'm gonna write about today because it royally sucked!! Sleepy time...
Well...Sorry I didnt post yesterday...It was just so boring that there was nothing to write about. But today...Today is a different story...lol My Day Well...It started off this morning with us just staying here while Mama and Johnny took Mamaw to the Doctor. Then we went to the pool...Wow the pool...Well it all started out well...then all the guys were fighting over me! Ive never been faught over before!! Ok so I'm hangin out with Cody, Justin, Spud and Toby. Jamie, Krista, and Raymond are there and they are around with us also. Well...Cody and I got to talking and He would protect me when anyone would mess with me which I thought was really cool so i Hung around with him more. Toby Got jealous and kept trying to take me away...and then Cody would save me! Spud would get in there and try to get me too...lol it was fun and all...Cody was all over me...hehe I think someone likes me...Only problem is that he is with Jennifer...and I dont want to ruin Mine and Jenn's friendship because of a guy...Thats just not cool. Cody and I got in trouble for PDA at the pool...he got my number from me and even invited me to the bowling alley tonight!!I dont want any of this stuff to put mine and David's relationship into a bad place...cuz i really love David and I cant help what other guys do...hehe!So anyways...I get home and I talked to Tim for a while on the phone, and I met Keiths GF Tasha...shes really cool...we have alot in common. I'm hoping Cody will call me sometime he is a really cool guy and would be a great friend I think. Well...I am going to make this short tonight...My sunburn is KILLING me!!!

Finally decided to do blogging. 2dae lectures end early becoz there is a graduation ceremony held in the afternoon. I see ppl goin home beri happy but im sad. I cant go home coz i got training in the evening. Nobody was there 2 accompany me. These couple of hours i began to think of you again. You seems so far but i wish tt u were wif me.wentwalking ard TM and then went back to sch again. So urlLink sianz! @_@ Training starts and i started jogging while watching the soccer match going on at the same time. 2dae's IVP soccer match is TP vs SP. This is an overview of the match : In the first half, TP dominated the game. At around 35th minute, a cross from the right side falls perfectly onto a TP's striker direction. He seized the opportunity and volleys the ball to the back of the net. GOAL!! TP took the lead. In the second half, TP's players were lacking in fitness but they still tried to attack quite a number of times. Sp's goalkeeper performed well in the second half. He managed to perform some great saves and refused to let TP increase the lead. At ard 75th minute, a mistake from a TP's defender in the penalty box gave SP a penalty kick. SP's striker no.9 slammed it home. GOAL!! SP equalised. TP's goalkeeper was disappointed. He dived the right direction but yet did not managed to keep his clean sheet. Final Score : 1-1
I finished Memoirs of a Geisha. It was really brilliant and provided a window into the world of the Geisha. I have much respect for them. They are not high paid prostitutes as many people seem to thing. They had honor and respect. I really would love to meet some real Geisha when I go to Japan. Ha, I honestly don't believe I would ever have enough money though. Perhaps one day. Today I haven't done that much. I have just been spending time with my mom and brother. I know my mom and brother are going to miss me a lot when I leave. I know mom wishes I didn't leave the state, but I just know that this is the right path. I mean it was like a sign when I heard of Wittenberg. It was last summer, and I received a pamphlet from them, and they knew about my interest in Japan. I still don't know to this day how they found a guy in a small town in Alabama, because they don't have a single student from Alabama. It has to be destiny. Well that is all for today. Take care everyone and God Bless.
I have been reading Memoirs of a Geisha almost all day today. It is such a fascinating novel. I never realized how difficult being a geisha is. It also talks about Japan's past. If I could live in any time it would definitely be either before the Meiji era or the early 1900s in Japan that is. I have also been fond of the Wild West era of America. Ha I guess I am just a hero kind of guy. Cowboys and samurais always seemed so cool and brave always saving the damsel in distress and other heroic deeds. Anyway, I am losing track of what I wanted to say. I have gained an even greater respect of the Japanese from this book. They have such a dignified and polite manner. Well, that is about it for today. I suppose it is just too late or something. See you later.
I always seem to have all these thoughts in my head, and I need to find a way to let them out. I thought a Blog would be the best place to do it. I really don't expect anyone else to read this, but everyone is welcome into my world. The reason I decided to name this page Baka Gaijin (Stupid Foreigner) is that I will be starting college in Ohio next month, and I feel like I will be a stupid foreigner there. I have grown up in Alabama my entire life, but there were no colleges around here that had what I wanted. You see my dream in to live in a peaceful town in Japan with a career that I enjoy and that helps people. I found a college that let's you major in East Asian Studies, and I decided that I wanted to go there. It is a private university though, but somehow I was accepted. I will be able to learn Japanese there, and I can study in Japan my third year. It seems like the best place to begin my quest to achieve my dreams. I just hope that I am smart enough to make it through. My family and friends think so, but I have been having doubts. I also wonder if I will be able to make it in Japan. Not to be stereotyping are anything but the Japanese are in my opinion the most intelligent group of people on the planet. How can I fit in? Well that is a bit lengthy explanation on the Baka Gaijin. I will be posting my thoughts and experiences in a "foreign" land. Take care everyone.

Once in a while, you hear of a movie and you think, "Hmm, that might be good." You also think that it has the potential to be really horrible. You read a couple reviews and you ask around a bit, but no one's seen it because it's new and low budget or foreign or something. You decide, "What the hell, I'm going to see it!" You take your chances and are rewarded with 90 minutes so rewarding that you feel like you've been punched in the stomach - but in a good way. Yeah. urlLink The Garden State - see it ASAP. I don't want to have to call the movie theater and get the times for you!
Thursday night is my first Open House with the Parents night. We see each class for only 8 minutes, and that's all of NOTHING, so it's no big deal. But to be perfectly honest, it makes me freak out when I think about it. Just me and the parents. Scary. I got my first nasty note back from a parent today. I know and KNEW I was totally in the right on the whole situation, which incidently was not that big of a deal. But it sort of bothered me. Parents. I hate them. It'll also just be wierd to be on the other side of the Open House Night. The side that never got to go. Every year when my mom and dad went to my open houses, I'd always wait up for them to come home and ask them all about what they thought of my teachers. Now, I'm the one everyone is coming to meet. Being on the other side is sort of surreal. Like during the televised morning announcements. These kids LIVE for the morning announcements. If I forget to turn on the TV, they're all like, "What about morning announcements, Ms. Grace?" I remember getting all excited for that sort of thing too. It was so exciting to see that eighth grader or whatever get up and bumble over words and crack silly jokes. But let me tell you, those morning announcements are just a big fat plate of nothing. But hey, for sixth graders, it's the little things, I guess. The little things like, being impressed that I can name all the presidents of the United States in order. Impressed that I know how to tell the difference between a crocodile and an aligator. Impressed by my 10 minute contour line drawing of my shoe. It's all about the respect, guys. And I'm earning it inch by inch. I think that this grade might just be perfect for me. I think you push me up to eighth graders and they'd think I was the biggest, squarest, lamest, jerk of a teacher ever. Too bad that I don't think they're parents will be impressed by that sort of thing. Oh well, I'll do what I can.
When my dad calls my cell phone and I don't answer, he doesn't leave a message, but he calls 4 MORE TIMES?! WTF, Dad? This has been especially irksome this week since my mom has been out of town and he needs someone to herd. At least that's my theory. I just can't tell you how annoying it is to check your "Missed Calls" and they're all from "Daddy Cell". All. Of. Them.
If someone could please tell me what could possibly feel better than... 1) Waking up with a little doggy snuggling next to you under the covers. 2) Waking up refreshed, but early enough to get ready leisurely, have a cup of coffee and read the paper before heading off to start the day. 3) Hearing a kick ass homily at Mass by a man who seems to be a kick ass Franciscan. 4) Having wings and lemonade for lunch with an old college boyfriend. Having the wings be great, the conversation fun, and the taste in my mouth afterwards not feel spicy or nostalgic. 5) Going down to the mall to return a very "un-Gracie" dress which the ex-fiance gave me the weekend of my melt down when I realized that I could never, ever marry him, and finding out it was worth $69.99 at urlLink THIS store (which comes close to heaven). 6) Proceeding to buy a perfect skirt and cute necklace and earrings for some occasion that has not popped up yet, but WILL most definitely pop up eventually. 7) And only having to spend $14.99 in addition to the store credit of the "un-Gracie" dress. 8) Getting up the guts to call a tiny crush to tell him there's no news on the Bible study (just an excuse) and maybe he'd like to get coffee with me tonight before I head back up home. No coffee tonight, for he is en route from NYC after a wedding, but said he'd "definitely call me so we can do it." ...they must be watching the sun set on the French Riviera while drinking drinks with limes in them along side urlLink Audrey Tautou , Clark Gable, and of course Albert and Eleanor. And where Clark completely ignores everyone else and thinks you are the most stunning, smart and angelic creature in existence. PS. Yes #1-8 happened all today. Boom!
Even though I haven't seen a spot of rain today, Charlie, this is for you... You made it possible for me to make a much needed trip to the bank. You also made it possible for me to get my tire fixed with no hassles. You also allowed me to stay up later and finish the book I've been reading. You allowed me to NOT set the alarm last night before finally going to bed. You were the reason I got to see Katie Couric in Athens this morning. You are why I could crawl back into bed and sleep a little more. You are the reason that when I finally did get up and showered and dressed, I could put on my flip flops and wear them for the rest of the day. You are why I'm catching up on things that needed catching up on. You are why I now have a 3-day weekend. Thanks, Charlie, I owe you one. PS. You are the reason one of my "holidays" will be made into a school day. But I won't hold that against you right now.
The first day of school from a teacher's perspective was so different than it was back when I was in sixth grade. I remember my first day of sixth grade. It was also my first day of private school. For five years I attended your average public elementary school. I had friends. I rode the bus. I sang in the choir, played the hand bells and was in art club. I even did a stint as a "square dancer" which was the highest notch on the elementary school dancing hierarchy, with "folk dancers" following behind. A new school, a private school and my first day in what we call "Middle School". It was also my first day in uniforms. We had PE uniforms too, that you had to change into in a teacher's classroom. Boys and girls were segregated for PE, which seemed strange at first, but I actually ended up liking. The girls were nice and I made friends. But they didn't associate much with the boys. I wasn't a big dater back when I was 10 years old or anything, but this struck me as bizarre. Every birthday party in 5th grade was of the boy-girl nature with the likes of Roger Rabbit, the Cabbage Patch, and of course, everyone's favorite Running Man. There might even be a slow dance to Timmy T, with more than enough room for the Holy Spirit, Father and Son. Back in fifth grade, they also played spin the bottle, though I was always one of the outsiders on that affair. I distinctly remember totally relating to DJ's boy-girl birthday party on Full House. Come on guys, 10 years old, OK? So sixth grade brought things other changes other than uniforms and a regression in male/female relationships. It also brought changing classes. I don't remember that as being much of a big deal. But I do remember that keeping track of all the teacher's books, folders, homework and one locker combination to be a challenge. Sixth grade meant organizing. When I got the the first day of school as a first year teacher in a sixth grade art classroom, no, I really wasn't nervous. I had it all planned out. I knew what I was doing. I finished student teaching with minimal amounts of tears and flying colors. 6 classes of sixth graders. Piece of cake. What my secret weapon was, was knowing that they were more scared than I was on my first day of teacher pre-planning. They were terrified. They were small. One boy was afraid to TALK. I heard talk of the first day of school back in teacher preparation classes. "You'll go straight home and go to bed and not wake up until the next morning!" "You'll never be so tired as you are your first year!" "The first year, man are you in for it!" I don't make light of the situation, or exaggerate my classroom management abilities. I'm too nice. I give in. When I asked that they bring in their "Welcome Letters" signed by their parents TOMORROW "or else it's a ZERO", I knew that I wouldn't be giving out any zeros the next day. I laugh at the bad kids inside. I think about which boys I would fall in love with, if I were in sixth grade. When a boy farted in my class, I wasn't sure what I should do. I say things like "cool". And "awesome". And "dude". I went into this school taking the don't-smile-before-Christmas attitude. I wanted the kids to behave. I don't want chaos to erupt in 4 weeks. I want them to make great art. But on the first day, when I heard a student tell his friend that "Middle school is really hard because the teacher's are so STRICT!" and I was stupid enough to as, "Like ME?!", he said, "NO, you're nice!" Yeah, I suppose that's usually a compliment. But I was so excited at the fact that I might be STRICT, it was crushing to be called NICE. I wasn't going for NICE. Maybe it's a good thing I was shooting for strict because if I had shot any lower, I would have hit SOFT or EASY or something much worse. By the third day of school, I was kicking some ass and taking names. I haven't given out a referral. Yet. And I haven't given out any zeros. But tomorrow's the day. Tomorrow will mark one week down with many more to go!
Enough of summer! Summer officially ended 3 days ago. Work has commensed and Monday will be exciting and terrifying. I'm ready for it all to begin. I about a month off and it was a nice month of pools, beaches, apartment fixing and family time. Enough of that, I'm ready to start my career. My room is pretty much ready. My lesson plans are pretty much ready. And I'm ready to have a nice relaxing weekend with a friend's family and babysit her baby while they party at a wedding.
This summer has officially one day left in it for me. One. Day. Left. Started out perhaps the rockiest summer of my life. Is ending smoothly. I think it may be the calm before the storm because this next year is going to be a ride. Let's just hope a safe and theraputic one. Some things I learned this summer are... My parents rule. My friends rock. When I get married, I will not have assigned seating, my mother do all the work, a stressful experience. What happens in Key West, stays in Key West. Just because someone's 23 years old does not mean that she is above wetting her pants in public. Eating Harry Potter jelly beans with 10 year olds is fun. Coming back home is a blessing. Weekly city auctions are better entertainment than VH1. There are things in life that keep me sane - I'll let you in on some of them as we go. There's a short list, that is by no means complete. When I think, as I have this past weekend, about where I was 1 month ago...and 2 months ago, I shudder. I don't want to go back there again. I wish I could erase it from my memory. I guess there's no use in that though. Remembering bad things can be just as hard as remembering very good things. But for now, I'll concentrate on that last day of summer. Enjoy it. Love it. Hold it. And do the same with the career and life that has begun. And give me the strength to kick some 6th grade ass.
Here we go...
College is great, i started it off with 2d design, and that was boring for the first day. the only thing wrong with college, is that the damn materials are too damn exspencive!! and its ART!! baaaah!
Sleep: Noun1. a. A natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli. During sleep the brain in humans and other mammals undergoes a characteristic cycle of brain-wave activity that includes intervals of dreaming. b. A period of this form of rest. c. A state of inactivity resembling or suggesting sleep; unconsciousness, dormancy, hibernation, or death. now think about what i just said to you, and do one of the about, and its not hibernation! ZE END!!
You know what? there is plenty to hate in the world, and i don't mean dislike with a passion, i mean HATE! Not usually one of those feelings I would have but, bear with me.. #1 lack of sleep, my least favorite thing in the world, i hate it, its the most annoying thing when you wake up like ten minutes into a good dream to go to the bathroom, and then you just cant get back to sleep, and when you do get to sleep, about 20 minutes later, its time to get up, woopdy-fuckin-do!! that sux! #2 getting up for work, i had to do that all summer, it was annoying, i dont like getting up in the mornings to begin with, i mean college is one thing, but honestly, this is some shit... #3 work it self, damn it all to hell, i need the money, but you know what?! i dont need that damn experience of it, just give me money!! PLEASE!! im a starving(well not really but you get my point) artist thats in college, and im LAZY! #4 PAIN, i hate it.. period. people say that pain is just weakness leaving the body, well fuck people, that must mean that im losing like 1000 weaknesses a day, is that like gaining weight? cause for me, thats really fucking hard!(although i do weigh like 178lbs, but thats not the point) #5 OMG! religion, its just annoying in the first place, i know i've said this before, but honestly, its just a(no offence ment by this, nothin against religious people....yet again, bear with me, im tired) psycho-samatic disorder, it needs to die, and we are the ones who need to kill it... #6 finally, people that dont wanna know other peoples oppinion, OPINIONS ARE LIKE ASHOLES, EVERYONE HAS ONE, AND THEY ALL STINK, GET THE FUCK OVER IT ALREADY!!! ...ok that is all ZE END!!
I'm going to spend a lot of time writing about the Canadian elections during the month of June. For two reasons: 1) I am a Canada-ophile; have been since I was 10yo and was more interested in the Winnipeg school lunch menus, as announced on the CBC, than I was in my own; since CBC programs regularly became available on American radio in 1980 and I could hear them without tuning the shortwave dial; and since President Bush reminded me how idiotic we Americans can be sometimes. 2) I love politics. And 3) American politics is just plain shitty and boring right now, so if I take a month off from it I'm not likely to miss anything. Yes... three reasons why I'm going to write about Canadian politics. I will try to say smart and provocative things and not mess up. If I do, I trust kind Canadian readers will set me straight. Unlike the Canadian TV networks, I don't have a logo-encrusted bus outfitted with all the latest technology that I'm driving all over the country, in an effort to discover what Canadian voters think about the issues. I do, however, have a black Ford Escape XLT (featuring CD changer) that I've driven several times across a portion of Ontario in the past week and I feel confident that I've learned as much about what concerns Canadian voters as the networks will.
The elections are over. And now, please cue the remarkably bad analysis. Remarkably bad might be a bit much, although Andrew Coyne's shift from Conservative Triumphalism on Saturday to urlLink Bitter Old Crone this morning in the National Post marks one edge of the Lunatic Fringe. The urlLink Globe and Mail also goes a bit too far, in my opinion... and seems too dire by a touch in its assessment of what this election will mean for westerners, for instance. Make no mistake, there are deep divisions, but perhaps we shouldn't jump to the conclusion that these will end Canada As We Know It. The Canadian media made a couple of errors that the American media has made in assessing voter attitudes and intent. First, there was a lack of sense about voter behavior and the very simple tendency of angry voters to simmer down and think more carefully and strategically when stationed in the booth with a ballot in front of them. Second, media discovered, to their dismay, that voters failed to stick to the simple script they had written for this election: the voters are mad as hell and not going to take it anymore. Well, in fact, that was not the case. Voters were, and are, angry and pissy, but their response has been punishment, not blind rage. Paul Martin has a mandate, even though he and his party now enter a phase of minority rule. The mandate is, perhaps, not the traditional affirmation from voters. But, in fact, 39% of voters have turned to the Liberal party... and more than half of voters have allied themselves with the center-left policies of the Liberal and New Democratic parties, not to mention the considerable support for the Bloc in Quebec. Part of this mandate is to continue those center-left policies, yes. But part of that mandate is also an expectation that the Liberals will keep their promises and clean up their act. This is punishment, but it's kind of like the judgment a parent would pass on a child: you can be forgiven, but there will be consequences. Two key themes, then, in my opinion: punishment, but ultimately, acceptance of the Liberals. It might be a grudging acceptance in the absence of an acceptable alternative, but acceptance is what it is. Politics isn't often pretty and this victory is a perfect example. The other theme is the repudiation of Stephen Harper's Conservatives. Not for all time, perhaps. But despite an election called just weeks after the party merger, voters gave Harper a chance and then turned away from him to return, largely, to the center-left. Some of this was because of negative advertising. Some of this was because of uncertainty. But it was also because Harper was unable or unwilling to present a clear, unambiguous vision for Canada. When he did talk vision, Liberals accused him of a secret agenda. Why did the charge stick? Because Harper's statements and careful reporting seemed to give credence to that view. It was also because Harper's desire to present a moderate face to Canadian voters was difficult to sustain in his stitched-together coalition as other members of his party stepped forward with more extreme views about abortion and gay rights, among other issues. Issues like the long-term prospects for Liberals in the West, and Canadians' concerns about democracy aren't dire. But that's not to say they don't exist and that they don't need to be addressed. What is called for is a sense of proportion. And now, let's look ahead to a minority government for Canada. The experience of minority government has been positive, in part. Maybe that will be the case this time. It will certainly be interesting.
There are still votes to be counted and at this point it looks as though about 30 seats are still not locked in yet... but we can definitely point to a Liberal minority government, with Jack Layton (woohoo!) and the NDP serving as the linchpin in the next Parliament. At the moment, he's speaking at his party's event in Toronto, with mixed emotions no doubt since his wife, Olivia Chow, lost her chance to go to Ottawa, representing the Trinity-Spadina region. A marvelous evening for the NDP with a gain of 8 seats and 6.5 percentage points. Layton on the Liberals: "We will hold them to" their promises. "We will find how interesting Paul Martin finds the idea of proportional representation." The Bloc looks to walk away with 56 seats... another thrilling win for the Bloc in Quebec.
CTV News now predicts a minority government, as well.
CBC News predicts a Liberal minority government.
We're, of course, looking at very early results coming in from Ontario and so the numbers aren't as important at the moment, but what we must note is the strong showing the Liberals are enjoying right out of the gate in Ontario. The held on in Atlantic Canada and now in Ontario, the results are -- at first blush-- better than one might have predicted. Let's not get carried away, but it's an early and potentially hopeful sign.
Lest I forget, an important symbolic in the riding of Kings-Hants for Scott Brison, who left the Progressive Conservatives for the Liberals after the merger. Brison is openly gay, but has shown the ability to serve his constituents well... and despite some hard feelings in his riding, he has achieved a solid victory. Here's a urlLink CBC News backgrounder on Brison .
No results from Fredericton yet and no one seems to be sure why, but otherwise, Atlantic Canada is delivering stronger results for the Liberals than in 2000. The Conservatives are performing less well and the NDP is either elected in, or leading in, 4 ridings. The analysts on CBC and CTV are focusing mainly on perception of the new Conservatives and connections to the old Alliance party, which aren't a big help in Atlantic Canada.
While we're awaiting the early results from the Atlantic provinces... check out this prediction of a fundamental, and most likely, disturbing change for Canada predicted by the urlLink National Post's Andrew Coyne on Saturday. A good deal of it is social conservative utopianism and, thus, can be dismissed. But it's just scary enough that it's worth paying attention to.
Turnout has been heavy throughout the day, according to reports from CBC News and Global News Toronto. There have been more than a million votes cast in advance of today's elections, as well. Global News Toronto is projecting 57 seats for the Liberals and 40 for the Conservatives in Ontario, based on the latest poll results. What do the poll results of the past few days mean when voter turnout is much higher than expected-- as appears to be the case? Good question and one area of interest as we prepare for election returns, which begin on the east coast in about an hour.
We'll go live with election results beginning at 7pm ET tonight. Coverage will continue here until the new political landscape becomes clear.
It's not in today's paper, but if you're lucky, the urlLink Globe and Mail website will still have the latest picture of a party leader eating ice cream. Today, it's Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe. mmmm. Previously featured... Conservative party leader Stephen Harper and PM Paul Martin, both munching on cones. Unless I missed it, we await a photo of NDP leader Jack Layton peering from behind a mountain of ice cream. Green Party leader Jim Harris is demanding equal time. Vanilla, please.
Four days to the federal elections and among us political junkies, there's a growing sense of excitement. At this point, it's likely to be close and it's likely to result in a minority government. There are lots of studies about how minority governments behave and whether they last and whether they accomplish much, but for pure intrigue, you can't beat them. If I lived in Canada, I would be somewhere between Liberal and NDP in my political orientation. So my personal interest lies in seeing that kind of combination. The Alberta Health Care Flap -- is it a Flap? Yes-- has left the Conservatives looking a little stupid. Alberta's Premier had planned to release a new health plan two days after the elections, a plan that was likely to include provisions for greater private service, etc. Basically, a major reform that the Premier had already said would likely violate the Canada Health Act, and one that voters wouldn't find out about until after they had cast their ballots. After a Liberal outcry, Premier Ralph Klein promised he would reveal the full plan yesterday. But his government gave only partial details of the plan. (The Bush administration is really good at that: promising full disclosure and revealing almost nothing.) So, the story morphed into "Klein fails to reveal full plans for Medicare." And, indeed, that's the play it got last night, and is still getting urlLink this morning . urlLink Soblo thinks this controversy over Alberta health care reforms could be the undoing of Stephen Harper. He's more knowledgeable than I am about Canadian politics - it may well be. I watched Paul Martin's appearance on CBC last night. I saw it on the Halifax feed so I could go to bed earlier, there being few other reasons to watch CBC Halifax. Overweight Canadians expressed their thoughts about the issues and flailed helplessly at the Prime Minister, who displayed his usual verbal dishevelment. A good finance minister doesn't necessarily make for a good Prime Minister. But at this point, voters seem more concerned about how Stephen Harper would be as a leader. And more and more of them seem to conclude that he wouldn't be that good.
A lot of spinning going on among Liberals and Conservatives over the new Ipsos-Reid poll showing a 6% Liberal lead. The rejoinder from the C's- the real vote is on Monday- is barely worth a "nice try." It may be the Liberals are closer to the mark in saying this is the result of Ontarians giving the party a second look. Here's what I would do if I was running things over at the NDP. I would continue to play up the importance of the NDP being a key player in the next government, whether it's minority Conservative or Liberal. I would continue to deliver a few good punches at Paul Martin. But I would allow for a subtle tilt toward the Liberals. Nothing too apparent, just aiming a few more of my guns at the Conservatives in Ontario now that they're down a little. Because for the NDP, the point is to be a key part of the next government. And that's really only possible, and palatable, if it's a minority Liberal government. I think Layton is already starting to do this... or at least that's how I interpret some of his actions over the past 24 hours.
My National Post today says that "Harper Widens Seat Lead." I'm not too sure about this. I've not seen his seat. But more seriously, there's the latest Ipsos-Reid poll for CTV and the Globe and Mail showing the Liberals ahead by six points. urlLink Soblo says this puts the Liberals and new-fangled Tories essentially back where they started a few weeks ago. So what's with the seats? The National Post and Montreal Gazette, sister papers, say 126 Conservative seats, 95 Liberals, 60 for the Bloc and 27 NDP. The Globe and Mail extrapolates based on its new poll: 110 seats each for L and C. The papers report most of the country has decided, except for Ontarians, which is interesting; maybe they're trying to decide just how angry they are at the Liberals, and just how concerned they might be about a Harper government. Last month, I said I wasn't going to concentrate too much on polls. But frankly, in a race this close and this uncertain, the polls can provide good snapshots of how people are agonizing over choices. If predictions come true, there will be a low turnout, and that only increases uncertainty. And there are 5 more days of politicking before Monday's elections. That's plenty of time for another stupid Conservative move - child porn, for instance - or another Liberal gaffe. We will see. I don't want Harper, or his hardened helmet of hair, running the show. In the past few days, I've felt cautious optimism.
I've reached what I'll call "Mansbridge Overload" on the Canadian federal elections. I'm still consuming about hour a day of Canadian campaign news, above and beyond my regular diet of Canadian bacon - The World at Six, Cross Country Checkup, election TV specials on CBC, the Globe and Mail, National Post... and tonight, the English Leadership Debate. But, I've never been a big fan of Peter Mansbridge on The National. I've taken to TiVoing the show and skipping through his parts. I thought I would hate the whole Election Bus thing that CBC and the other networks are using to promote themselves. And I do. It's a big fat gimmick, except that the dude on the CBC bus is kind of cool. Mark Kelley, and Tod Maffin on Radio, have produced some really nice, quirky pieces exploring the Canadian hinterland and assessing the views of the electorate. They remind me of the pieces the American network correspondents do every four years when they discover that people actually live, however strangely, in flyover country. Except, American reports usually depict midwesterners as kindly rubes. A much larger proportion of the Canadian population lives in urban areas. But still, I haven't seen Canadian TV trying to do much more than show the quaintness of rural life. By the way... you can read the official Bus weblog urlLink here . While I'm picking favorites, I'll also mention "Spinoff." It's a regular series of off-beat election reports. Most of it is excellent, some of it is quite funny. I don't think there are web archives of the program (CBC's Official Web Strategy places less emphasis on web-streaming than the BBC, for instance) but you can listen live online on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11:45am ET on any of the CBC Radio One ET streams. Any online CBC station elsewhere in the country also runs it at 11:45am local time. Don't talk to me about Newfoundland Time.
The former Prime Minister called him a great friend of Canada... and an icon. urlLink Here's the story from the Globe and Mail website .
Heard an interview last night on urlLink As It Happens with a spokesperson from the Green Party lamenting the party's exclusion once again from the leadership debate. Credible, well-argued. The party is what we would call fringe in American politics and thus far, it's not won a single seat in Parliament. But it does have a regional power base and a thin layer of support spreading across the rest of the country. If I remember correctly (I'm in an airport with sluggish wireless, so pardon my decision not to double-check) the Greens are around 6% in the last poll. They've apparently reached the threshhold to receive government funding. Listening the interview last night, I thought yeah their candidate should be in the debate, too. It's kind of ironic because if it were the US elections we were talking about, I would say don't include them... unless they were fielding a high profile candidate. One of those opinions is probably wrong.
The Globe and Mail has the latest installment of its series urlLink "Will Chandler Vote?" ... following 23 year old Chandler Powell from the University of Toronto, as he tries to decide if he'll vote at all in the federal elections; and if so, for whom? He has some smart things to say and he's also kind of hot. (Unfortunately, I don't think his picture is included in the Internet version of the story.) I'd like to talk with him about the election. Personally. Martin's people have changed tactics... standard political playbook stuff... to deal with the fact that probably 70% of Canada is pissed off at him. That has to be worked on first because you can't effectively raise questions about your opponent(s) if you have a serious credibility problem. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty will be sent to Promise Keepers for pledging not to raise taxes, and then... uh-huh.
The Globe and Mail's urlLink website calmly states the tide might be turning toward the Conservatives in Canada's federal elections. But the paper itself features the giant numbers 34-30, the slim lead the Liberals now have over the Conservatives in the new Ipsos-Reid Poll, commissioned by CTV and the Globe and Mail. It's the lowest poll number for the Liberals since Martin became PM in December. On one level, the poll confirms the gut feeling of many during the first full week of campaigning. Paul Martin didn't do poorly, but it was no breakthrough week. The Conservative's Stephen Harper, on the other hand, was the winner after the first round of campaign appearances; Mr. Stiffie stuck to his script with barely a stumble. On another level, though, the polls could also be the result of media coverage, which was generally more harsh on Martin-- the classic front-runner heading for a fall. Harper got off much more lightly by comparison... the NDP's Jack Layton also drawing attention away from Harper with a political incorrect gaffe last week essentially blaming the PM for the deaths of homeless people. Harper's coverage was generally positive. But the news media follows its own script. And once the darling becomes front-runner, journalists begin the process of dissecting and dismantling him. Expect Harper to have to answer more questions about some of the less-palatable statements he's made in his recent past. And expect a more careful examination of his platform, which manages to dramatically increase spending while promising taxes lower than in the US. It probably doesn't add up and the next week or two will be a close examination of Stephen Harper and what he plans to do for Canada. The story of the day is the potential for a Conservative minority government with the Bloc Quebecois as the junior partner. Fascinating, but likely? Certainly an odd couple, but the fact is that this latest poll shows that the Liberals couldn't put together a majority with the NDP because the NDP is basically nowhere to be found. Jack Layton got a lot of media attention last week, much of it the kind he probably didn't want. In the most recent elections, the NDP has failed the climb out of the single digits, so at this point, perhaps anything is an improvement. I'm beginning to ramble, so let's get out. A couple of things to watch: young people apparently have been leaning toward Harper, or so I heard a couple of times last week. I haven't seen a good breakout of demographics so I'll keep my eyes open for that. I've been paying a lot of attention to the Liberal collapse in Ontario. Ontarians are angry about the broken tax promise of the provincial Liberals. It'll be interesting to see how deep and lasting that anger is. Oh, and so much for the high-mindedness. A week ago, the CBC nearly broke its arm patting itself on the back for how wonderful its election coverage was going to be. "We won't focus on the horse race," we were told. The CBC was to present a searing, important conversation among Canadians about the future direction of the country. Which lasted for about a day. The CBC has done a better job of staying on message, but it's hard to resist the joy of dualing messages from party war rooms flashing across Blackberry devices from coast to coast. And look what I'm doing. A big chunk of what I've written has been about media coverage of the campaign and not the issues themselves. So there ya go.
Watch for a relaunch of this site on 8/1!
I wrote my bio today. It was for a company marketing vehicle. Have you ever been asked to do that before? Have you ever done it and not felt like an ass? Mine was kind of long. While I was writing it, it seemed alright. But when I finished and read it through once, it came across as kind of self-serving. So I made a few changes. The second run-through left me feeling pompous. So there were more changes. The third time, I thought to myself, "You are quite the ass." I know bio's-- especially ones you write about yourself-- are probably going to be a little self-serving. That's part of the privilege of getting to tell your side of the story. But I was annoyed with the attitude I projected. In the compression of a life from 30-odd years to 10 paragraphs, even modest achievements become little miracles. That's because there's no time for explaining how your best friend's cousin knew this person, who was a friend of someone in the business, who was able to put in a good word for you, and get you an internship at Company X. All of that becomes, "I went to work at Company X." It's almost as though you appeared in the lobby with doves, a halo and the voice of God: "This is my son, in whom I'm well pleased. Hire ye him." (To paraphrase the Holy text.) After I finished agonizing over it, I decided that in the future I won't worry about it anymore. I'll just be a pompous ass. In fact, I'm going to make it all up from now on. My new list achievements will include: 1) Knighthood by the King of Spain 2) A Grammy for Best Spoken Word Performance 3) Member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 4) Chairman, Pioneer High School PTO (well, it sort of brings me within reach of the unwashed.) 5) Iowa Pork Queen, 1996 6) Most Likely to Succeed, Harvard Class of 1989 and 7) Owner of Small Carribbean Island I feel better already.
Good day! It's a busy one, but I thought I'd pass along this bit of humor forwarded me from my friend Rick: The Washington Post recently published a contest for readers in which they were asked to supply alternative meanings for various words. The following were some of the winning entries: Abdicate (v.), to give up all hope of ever having a flat stomach. Carcinoma (n.), a valley in California, notable for its heavy smog. Esplanade (v.), to attempt an explanation while drunk. Willy-nilly (adj.), impotent. Flabbergasted (adj.), appalled over how much weight you have gained. Negligent (adj.), describes a condition in which you absentmindedly answer the door in your nightie. Coffee (n.), a person who is coughed upon. Testicle (n.), a humorous question on an exam. Rectitude (n.), the formal, dignified demeanor assumed by a proctologist immediately before he examines you. Circumvent (n.), the opening in the front of boxer shorts. The Washington Post's Style Invitational also asked readers to take any word from the dictionary, alter it by adding, subtracting or changing one letter, and supply a new definition: Sarchasm: The gulf between the author of sarcastic wit and the reader who doesn't get it. Reintarnation: Coming back to life as a hillbilly. Inoculatte: To take coffee intravenously. Dopeler effect: The tendency of stupid ideas to seem smarter when they come at you rapidly. Intaxication: Euphoria at getting a refund from the IRS, which lasts until you realize it was your money to start with.
Let me explore my geek side for just a bit. Check out the urlLink screenshots of the new Microsoft operating system called "Whistler." It's an interesting new look for the next generation of the Windows OS. The next version will mark the convergence of what until now has been two different systems... the 9x systems like Windows 95, 98 and ME... and the NT/2000 systems. Integration with the Internet will be tighter than ever. And there are even some predictions that the Internet Explorer browser will disappear as the Internet becomes a more natural extension of the personal computer. Release is expected in late 2001.
My friend Rick on the demand for high speed Internet: Never have so many had so little to say-- and insisted on saying it at blinding speed.
ok... here's the question of the day: which takes less time... paying with exact change or accepting change as a part of your cash back? I realize that even asking this question says something about me. And I admit it. I'm a very impatient person-- a total Type A when it comes to stuff like that. I'm the type of person who never approaches a locked door without the key already out of the pocket and ready for the lock. I've developed a complicated system of actions to speed my way through airport check-in and security. And my workday is one long string of maneuvers to get things done faster. So there I am in line at Einstein's Bagels. I'm about to purchase a scone. In front of me-- one guy. The cash register rings up $4.18. The guy hands over a fiver. And just as the helper is about to grab his change, the guy says, "Wait a minute! I have change." What follows next is almost too painful for words. I could recount, in detail, the scrounging through pockets... the tedious counting of coins... how the guy comes up a penny short and has to settle for change for his five. But you'd probably be crying, screaming, begging me to stop. In the meantime, the line has grown long, time has passed, Italy probably has a new Prime Minister, and everyone is focused on the guy in front, who scratches his head and smiles weakly, "Gosh, I thought I had enough." Uh-huh. Now there's another side to this: most of us think loose change is an annoyance. we'd jump at the chance to avoid getting more change. And if we could give up some of our coin stock, it would make our day. I estimate that I have close to a billion dollars in coins in cups at home. So maybe I should stop complaining and develop another complicated system for having loose change at-hand. Then I could pay with exact change and reduce the roomful of pennies, nickels and dimes I have at home. Nah...
You mean today isn't Wednesday??!?!
OK... so it looks like I've been right. The rest of today has been better! At least when compared to the disappointing oatmeal/granola incident early this morning. And thank goodness work is over for the week!!
I'm warning you right now: I'm going to be writing about granola. uhuh... granola. you know, the tasty treat that's not just for breakfast anymore. So I stop by a decent restaurant this morning for breakfast. I rarely have time for breakfast on weekdays, so I was looking forward to oatmeal and granola. The restaurant served me hot instant oatmeal and granola from a cereal box. BUT I'm certain that the rest of my day will be much better!
Alright. I want a kitten. My friend Eric just got one today and I just got back from seeing it. It's about 13 weeks old... and it's really scrappy and fun the way a kitten can be. I can't have pets in the apartment I'm in. But I wonder if I could beg or convince the landlord to let me have a kitty? I'd get a kitten with a "dog mentality." Know what I mean? The kind of cat who's excited when you get home after work; who likes to play and stuff. I'm such a pushover. :)
Today's news flash in the District of Columbia--which has never let education get in the way of childhood--is that the school system has placed $41,000 worth of ads on 75 city buses, all with a typo: "Go to class -- It' a Blast."
... another piece of good news. A Fed rate cut and a record increase in the value of my stock portfolio. Now if only I hadn't lost so much in the first place! And here's even more good news: the National Geographic cable channel launches this weekend!! I don't know why I find this so exciting-- except that I''m really into the whole Shark/Polar Bear/Everest world of National Geographic specials on PBS. So, effective Sunday, there will be 24 hours of Sharks, Polar Bears and Everest. All of this leaves me with a couple misgivings. First, like most people I barely have time to watch the amount of TV we Americans are apparently required by law to watch. Second, I wonder if I'll overdose on Borneo. What else... oh! there's a new restaurant in Ann Arbor. That's about as earth-shattering as the Pope's Catholicism, I know. But I gathered a group of friends last night to go check out the Sunflower Cafe. It's been open about a week. Early projection: a B+. It's one of those Macrobiotic, Vegan, Vegan, Whole Wheat, Noodle and Kukichi Tea type of places. I had noodles with Miso and Ginger-- just to remind myself why i don't like Miso all that much. My bf Chris had a pizza with onions and spinach. And my best pal Nersi had a veggie burrito. Verdict: mmmmmm... Plus it's only 2 blocks away from where I live. Which could mean a much more macrobiotic lifestyle in my future...
Alrighty... here it is... my first Blog! It's appropriate, considering we're celebrating the new year and the new millennium. There's so much new-ness... and yet so much that remains the same. Like work, for instance. I'm still getting up at 3:15am on weekdays in this new millennium. I'm still walking through the doors at work at 4am. I'm still working till 2pm or later. And I'm still studying for the next day's work for another 3-4 hours on top of that. Oh yeah, I'm still trying to work out 4-5 times a week and see friends and who knows what else! Frankly, I don't think I'm some sort of martyr or anything. Most of us are really busy, trying to do 3 things when we only have time for two... trying to fit 10 pounds of you-know-what into a 5 pound bag. Alright, that's it for the moment. But there's more to come!
I'll admit it. I used to snicker at those "where have our manners gone" diatribes. They were the product of old, boring and haughty people with little to worry about in life except whether to guy standing next to them was chewing his gum a little too loudly. This was my opinion... until last night. The boyfriend and I joined a couple of other friends for a night at the theater. We were all pretty excited about seeing "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon." Scheduling a screening at a time that would work for everyone was hard, but we managed to make it work for Tuesday night. The Michigan Theater is a theater in the grand tradition and it's been beautifully restored. So, in short, a good movie with good friends in a good theater. How could we go wrong? Well, here's how. A couple sitting directly behind us talked all the way through the movie. It was a not-so low-level dialogue that began sometime after the opening scene and conitnued intermittently through the entire film to the closing credits. The conversation included such gems as "They're flying! Is that a metaphor?" Also, "Was that a flashback?" as well as a few nicely positioned "What just happened?" queries. Now I tend to be a pretty flexible guy. But there are some things I think are important in life. Now, it's obviously down the list a little ways, but "No talking during movies" is one of those principles. You can talk during the trailers. You can play the "Movie Quiz" or try to guess the actor's name from the mixed up letters (why is it always Antonio Banderas?). But once the movie company logo is on the screen, that's it until the closing credits roll. I suppose I should have just said something to them. I wouldn't have been an ass. I could've said something like, "Do you mind?" Or I could have given them The Look of Death. Instead, I seethed quietly. That's the kind of guy I am... and in my opinion, it's a failing of mine. I kept all the frustration bottled up and by the end of the movie, as their discussions were getting more frequent, I was ready to pull out a gun and shoot them both. There should be something you can do that's sort of a "middle road" between and a look and a shotgun. Mace?
Here's a tale of woe: I haven't been able to sync my Palm Vx for about a week because I bought a new laptop. Sound odd? Let's review the facts: *old laptop has standard serial connection. syncing works perfectly *new laptop is now official location for Outlook files, etc. *new laptop has a female 9 pin connector *he buys a male-male adaptor *adaptor doesn't fit because new laptop's serial connection is non-standard configuration *new laptop doesn't have infrared port *new laptop does have USB *he buys (for $35) a USB to 9-pin connector and now we wait... Life ain't easy sometimes!
Washington Post book critic Jonathan Yardley has written a urlLink piece that captures perfectly the dilemma of the book reviewer... or the person in my kind of profession. If you're a surgeon, do you rush home at the end of a long day to sew? If you're a book critic, do you still read for pleasure?
Scott Rosenberg has written a pretty dark view of urlLink the Web as we know it ... but his point of view is one worth considering. Weblogs and other tools might bring web publishing and journalism to the masses. But let's face it: the real money is with AOL/TimeWarner, Microsoft and Disney.
A dinner my roommate and I had with some other gay friends last night reminded me of the rich history of gay life in America. In particular, of the Mattachine Society and the important role it played in gay life-- before 1970. It was a very secretive society. But this was a time where most gay men were guarded about their sexual orientation-- even with other gay men. The fact that you wore a yellow handkerchief in your breast pocket might be the only indicator to another that you were "a friend of Dorothy." The Matachine Society itself was set up in such a way that members of one cell group in a city might not know anyone else who was a member of another cell in the same city. It was kind of like the Freemasons. It was a very closed society for gay men at a time when society was very closed to gay men, if you get my drift. A new, more activist, gay consciousness grew in the years after Stonewall and the Mattachine Society fell behind the times. But it still holds an important place in gay history. Here are some places where you can dig around for more information about the Matachine Society, or gay history in general.

Tuesday night, I was at home alone. A lot of my friends are getting jobs and moving away... so I've had more time to myself lately. My roommate Dave was also gone. AND, my wireless network at home was down, so I couldn't get high speed Internet access. It wasn't until I remembered the truly disadvantaged in this world that I stopped feeling bad about not having Internet. But even then, I'm afraid, that didn't last long. So... where was I? It was a cool storm. A *really* cool storm. It came up to Ann Arbor from the south. From the distance, it looked pretty exciting, so I got a glass of wine and went out on the deck. Lots of lightning and thunder and beautifully shaped clouds. The leading edge of the clouds was oval shaped as it advanced on the city. After a few minutes, the wind picked up and I could see dust swirling in the distance. It was incredible as it swirled around the top of a 10 story building downtown. This mass of swirling dust was coming toward me. But when it hit me, it turned out to be rain. It was a gusher of a storm. I was marvelling at the power of nature for perhaps 10 whole minutes before I wished I had high speed Internet to track the radar. At least for 10 minutes, I was a normal person!
It's always like this isn't it? Birthdays aren't really a big deal, are they? Except that I'm going to eat ice cream tonight... which is unusual... and I'm going to use this as my excuse to buy even more books for myself. Around the Web The urlLink London Times reports it was Gauguin who cut off Vincent Van Gogh's urlLink ear . German historian Rita Wildegans says no one can be sure what happened, but the evidence points away from Van Gogh and toward the drunk swashbuckler wannabe Gauguin. urlLink Why are chilis so hot? Scientists say it's evolution trying to stop us from eating the pods and destroying the seeds. Here's one of the finest urlLink remembrances of Eudora Welty that we're likely to come across...
I'm going to be 34 years old tomorrow. And in case you can't tell I'm happy about it! :) You see, here's the thing. The excitement of Gay Life doesn't end at 30. It ends when I stop breathing. And until then, I'm on top of the world. Don't get me wrong... I feel very fortunate to have had success... and I don't believe in crowing about it. But tomorrow, as I celebrate turning 34... I'm going to. My career is as far along as it's ever been. My body looks better than it ever has. I've come through more life-changing and mind-expanding experiences this year than any other year up till now. I have some amazing friends. And I'm beginning to own up to my responsibility to speak out and make a difference. I have stumbled much. I've made many mistakes. I've done too many stupid things to number. Life is not about forgetting these mistakes... but learning from them, and being mindful of them even as I move on. So tomorrow I'll celebrate. I'll go out with friends and remember a few of the things that have happened this past year. I'll eat a bunch of ice cream, in spite of my better judgment. For the first time, I'll post shirtless pictures of myself on my website... with pics from 4 years ago. Life is wondrous... how exciting to get to wake up and experience yet another day of it!
It's been close to 2 years or thereabouts, but today officially marked the end of the Sunday Brunch. All my friends have been moving away to new jobs-- New York City, Madison, Chicago, DC-- and so the little circle brunch-goers has dwindled back to where it started: me. In the past, we've had anywhere from 2 to 8 taking up space at urlLink \Aut\BAR . Over the past several weeks, the numbers have been dwindling. Last week, it was Ken and I. This weekend, Ken is arranging the furniture in his new apartment in Chicago. I've always lived in university towns... my friends have mainly been students... and so I'm used to it. But I'm used to attrition... not a wholesale dying off. It's like Dutch People Disease. Well, we move on. It's time to welcome some new people to the circle and rebuild. Around the Web urlLink The Economist , the British bastion of free market, libertarian thinking, has published one of its strongest urlLink editorials on the issue of drug legalization yet. Check out the urlLink powerful articles that accompany it, too. Duh Are the record labels stupid and misguided? Yes. urlLink Do they have a clue? No. Was there a place where that was any more apparent than the Plug.In Conference? No.
It's been a really busy week and I probably won't have time to write much until tomorrow. But I wanted to take a moment to thank all of you for taking the time to write with suggestions and encouragement as I begin the conversation with my parents about being gay. Some of you I know well... others I don't. But thanks for your words and thoughts!
I don't think I've written anything about this for the weblog. But in mid-June, I wrote my parents to tell them that I'm gay. It's been a long time coming. I've been out to myself for about 9 years. And most of my friends have known either since I met them, or as long as 5 years or so. But my parents have been the only ones not to know. This has been mainly because of their devout Christian beliefs and their literal interpretation of the Bible. Well, I decided to change all that this year. So, for a number of reasons including the distance I live from them, I decided to write the to tell them I'm gay. A short while after that letter, I heard from them. Their letter expressed their love for me but their belief that I'm turning away from God to live a life of sin. In the weeks since, I've delayed writing them to decide how to respond. So this weekend, I received another letter from my parents. This letter reiterates and emphasizes the points I've already mentioned. Here's some of it: I think you've taken the world's way out. It's the world that tells you we can't fight it, then join it. But God gives us the strength to do what is right and godly. You mentioned that "knowing to do what's right is something that comes from God and our inner voice, not from others." Well, God didn't guide you in this direction, and if you were listening to him, you would know that his answer to us is never to give in to sin and to go the way of the world. Romans 1 tells us exactly what God thinks of the direction you are headed in, and that direction ends in spiritual and physical death. As your parent, I cannot sit by and let you live in that sinful lifestyle without at least telling you what I know and what God's word says. Your only option is to flee this sinful lifestyle. You need to start reading your Bible, going to a gospel preaching church, and finding godly friends to encourage you and help you grow in your relationship with Christ. I pray that you will be open to seeing the error of your ways, repent and come back to your relationship with Christ. I've had a day or so to consider my response... which I'll include here: Mom and Dad, Thanks for your recent letters. It’s good to hear your opinions. But frankly, I’m bothered by the continual implications that my friends are ungodly, that my lifestyle (of which you’re unaware) is inappropriate, that I’m neglecting the scriptures, and that I’m going to a church that’s not right. Let’s consider some facts. First of all, I exist in the form that God made me. Second, homosexuality begins in the womb, either as a genetic trait (passed from the mother’s side) or as the result of biological traits— chromosomal differences and testosterone among others. People don’t choose it, and of all the ridiculous things, they’re not “recruited” by other gay people. You’ve told me that God hasn’t guided me in this direction. But you aren’t qualified to speak on that issue. And neither is the Apostle Paul. What do you think being gay is? And why are you using words like “gay lifestyle” when you have no clue what that really means? Here, for instance, is the summary of my sinful lifestyle today: I had a cup of coffee. My neighbor and I went to the climbing gym. I played for about 3 hours with my roommate Dave’s 4 year old son Gabe. Then I read for an hour, and had Chinese food downtown. Tonight, I tossed the football out back with Dave and his brother. Friday night, my “lifestyle” consisted of going with Dave and Gabe to see Jurassic Park III. My “gay lifestyle” is going to work and studying. When I lived in Iowa, my “gay lifestyle” included watching Mystery Science Theater with Ann and Dan on Friday nights and coming over to your place for Sunday dinner after church. And my “gay lifestyle” includes my relationship with God and my time with the Bible. You’ve advised me to fight this “sinful lifestyle.” But I’m fighting a different battle. I’ve known what I am since I was a teenager. Back then, I was too scared and intimidated to say anything or to ask questions. My church, my school and my community were filled with softminded people, blinded by their own ignorance. For 9 years now, I’ve understood myself and over time I’ve become aware of a path that God has opened up for me to take in life. He’s given me intelligence, a measure of integrity and a public position, where I can have influence. And so now it’s time for me to stop being complacent about the things I see around me—about things ignorant people do and the things they say. Young people who’ve been born with a trait they got in their mother’s womb are being kicked out of their homes, beaten up on the playground, reviled by Christians whom Jesus called to love unconditionally, and called horrible names by their peers while teachers look the other way; and some young people die because others are ignorant and stupid. This is going to have to stop. My fight is against that kind of softmindedness. We’re free to hold different views on these issues. But if you’re going to say things to me about being gay, based on your own ignorance of what that is or your own reading of scripture, I recommend that first you take the time to educate yourselves. Todd This weblog is long enough, so I'll continue with this next time. I'm not sure why I find this so disturbing now... more than a month after my first letter to my parents. Maybe it's because I've decided to respond in a strong way to my parents. These are disturbing days... but we press on.
I had a pretty darn good weekend. urlLink Art Fair ended Saturday night promptly at 6pm. It's always amazing to see what happens after it's all over. I've never checked the rules, but there must be something in there about dismantling the whole operation as quickly as possible. I walked down the street for Chinese about 8:30pm last night and already the streets were half empty. This morning, you'd never know there were about 800 booths and 700,000 people in town over 4 days. Now that's efficient. Went to urlLink PlanetRock yesterday... my first ever visit to a climbing gym. I got the training and did my first couple of climbs there... and now my goal is to convince my roommate to be my climbing pard! I told his 5 yo son about climbing and for the next hour, he was climbing all over everything making up stories about climbing mountains. I think he'd be one heck of a climber, too! We'll see. Speaking of which, I had a great bonding experience with the roomie's son last week. My roommate tells me his son included me in the stories he makes up before bedtime... which is so dang cool! It's important for a few reasons that Gabe and I get along... and we've made a great first start.
It's only the first day of urlLink Art Fair and I'm already planning to get up on the roof of my building downtown and order everyone to LEAVE. Every year I think I can take it. "This year, I won't lash out at unsuspecting tourists," I tell myself. "This year, I won't pull out a gun and start shooting indiscriminately." But once again... Stuff "on-a-stick" is back. I don't understand people's fascination with buying objects fastened to a stick. From the way this stuff sells, you'd think every household in North America has 6 of them stuck in the front lawn. Still, there are other uses. What a wonderful way to kill a vampire and make an artistic statement. Especially if you buy the "Blowfish on-a-stick" I saw one happy person with today.

Apparently. I think I have a touch of it and I think it was the pizza . I bought some by-the-slice late last night. It was a great splurge-- in terms of calories and fat-- and it tasted so good! And as the guy was warming up my two slices, I thought, "hmmm.... wonder how long that's been sitting around." My guess now is that it was too long. I'm not suffering greatly or anything... just feeling slightly feverish and enduring the urlLink you-know-what . It really is a storm raging inside you. But, I'm not going to let this keep me from enjoying my weekend-- even though I won't be more than 20 feet from a bathroom today. So let's consult the Internet, the motherlode of information, to find some items sure to fascinate. I don't know if it's the subject, the pure wonder expressed by the writer, or just the title itself... but for days now, I've been obsessed with " urlLink Detroit---Stove Capital of the World ." The urlLink University of Michigan urlLink News Service has been slicing through the fat... right down to the meat of history. God bless 'em. This urlLink story would be funny, except that it's true. A 24 year old former CEO (yes, that's not a typo) who's fresh from running his last company into the ground, has a plan to buy urlLink Salon , fire everyone, replace all the original content with syndicated stuff... and make it profitable in 30 days. It's just so crazy, it... it's completely crazy! To call this a hostile takeover is probably justified. Continuing in this vein because it's oh so rich, here are urlLink plans to put a hotel on the moon . I can't imagine the convention revenue is going to be that high, but there are plenty of places on earth that also urlLink lack atmosphere ... and they're still attracting tourists, so there ya go. Typos We Love This one got caught pretty fast, I think, but not before my urlLink RSS urlLink software grabbed it... and I quote now from urlLink BBC Sci/Tech News : Atlantis nears space station dicking. The Atlantis orbiter, carrying a new "front door" for the International Space Station (ISS), is making its final approach prior to its docking at 0253 GMT Saturday 14 July.
In my book, the weekend begins officially on Friday afternoons at 2pm. And so here we are... if you're still at work at this very moment, then sorry but you're working on the weekend. :) I'm taking it easy on this final day of vacation. It'll be back to the grind on Monday. Next week is going to be fun. My roommate Dave is bringing his son Gabe home for the week. He's 5yo and is pretty damn smart. I'm looking forward to having more than just a weekend to hang out with him. Face the Music urlLink The Washington Post has an urlLink article about a test of the various PC music formats. A diverse panel found the Windows Media format the best of the lot-- not much of a surprise there. But naturally, none of the compression schemes sounded as good as CD's. Here's a urlLink truly wrong website ... enjoy, but at your own risk.
Today's post is coming a little later than usual because of problems with the Blogger site (actually DNS craziness) and then several hours of connectivity problems at the University of Michigan. So anyway, here I am. Yesterday, I sprained my finger tossing the football with the roommate Dave. I'd show you which finger but it wouldn't be nice of me. The Daver has been trying to run sprints regularly to improve his cardio fitness. So last night we ran 'em together out on the roof of the parking garage behind our loft in lovely downtown Ann Arbor. This is supposedly the oldest multi-level parking garage in the country. It was built sometime in the early 1950's. And if the developers get their way it'll be coming down in the next year or two to make way for a 5 or 7 story retail/office/condo thingy. But for now, it's an underutilized parking garage-- perfect staging for our football/sprint sessions. Now, let's just spare all of us by being upfront about this. I suck at running sprints. I don't have any practice doing that kind of high-level, short-burst cardio activity. So I suck royally. Am I willing to suck at some skill in front of Dave? If you knew the stuff he knows about me, you'd know this would be the least of my worries. Besides our plan has been to work out together in the fall if there's time. So I'll probably excel on the weight bench and he'll beat me in \other stuff. This is the thing, you see. I've opted for the pecs and six pack abs... but do they help much if a mugger challenges me to run sprints? You got that right. I had my first Highly Unsubtle Cruising Moment in a long time at the gym yesterday. I enter the gym... walk down the hall... call my workout partner a "fucker" (because I can) as I walk by him sitting on a bench... walk into the locker room... and encounter some little dark haired twink.. probably 21 yo. Apparently he knows the path to the sauna by heart because he's looking over his shoulder the whole time... smiling. He enters the sauna... smiling. Sits down in such a way that the window perfectly frames his face. He doesn't stop smiling. Now, I've been the target of a small amount of cruising at the gym-- less than most guys, I'm sure. But when it does happen to me, it always seems to be so blatant that it's almost a parody. It's like when people meet an older person and they automatically start talking very loudly and slowly. I stopped back a few minutes later because I forgot my workout gloves in the locker-- no really I did-- and there he was... looking out that window. Gosh, he's a happy fella, I thought.
So my friend Chris gave me a VHS with the first episodes of the new HBO series urlLink "Six Feet Under." I watched the first episode yesterday afternoon and was really impressed with it. When Dave got home last night we popped the tape in and watched the episode. The second episode followed... then the third, fourth... and we watched the fifth episode after that. The whole evening turned into a "Six Feet Under" festival... and we can't wait to see the next episode. I like a lot of things about the new series. First of all, it's not like the other crap on TV. There are no unsuspecting people being subjected to stunts pulled by cheap "Candid Camera" knockoffs. People aren't voting others off an island. There's no short bitch in black taunting some poor saps with bad puns. Let me just say Thank God for HBO! Second, urlLink Alan Ball has created somewhat odd, but quite believeable, characters. We're talking about one dysfunctional family. But I think all of us can see elements of our parents, siblings and even ourselves in these characters. Third, he's created two of the most credible gay characters I've seen on television so far. This is part of a general broadening of the depiction of gay life on TV. But I especially like the direction Ball is going with urlLink David and urlLink Keith . They are solid, grounded gay men... and the issues that the two are grappling with are new for gay characters on TV-- unless I've missed something. Fourth, it's a nice use of the medium. There are some beautiful shots, and the show has a top notch urlLink soundtrack . If you've not seen "Six Feet Under" yet, I'd recommend you give it a shot. I know it's tough! There's " urlLink The Sopranos ," " urlLink Queer As Folk ," " urlLink Oz ," " urlLink Sex and the City "-- there's almost so much good television right now that we have to cut back on the crap TV just to see it all!
I've had Windows XP running for a few days now and other than the urlLink Passport/Windows Messenger problems , all seems to be well. I'll post more on the OS in a few days. Mossberg: You Go!! The urlLink Wall Street Journal's Walter Mossberg, who played a big role in bringing the urlLink Smart Tags issue to the fore a few weeks back-- and helping to force MSFT to back down on the feature-- is back with a new concern about Microsoft. urlLink He says people who own more than one PC who want to upgrade to Windows XP are going to face a rude awakening. In his latest column, he describes MSFT's plan to force users to purchase one copy of Windows XP for each computer they own. Now, if you've ever bothered to read the really REALLY fine print in the software license-- and if you have thick glasses and buck teeth, maybe you have-- you've known that Microsoft has always preferred that we buy one copy for each use. But they never enforced it-- until now. Each copy requires "Product Activation" and you can't activate the same copy of Windows XP from more than one computer. Office XP is somewhat kinder in that you can activate it from up to 2 PC's. To quote liberally from Mossberg: What if your PC malfunctions, and you have to reinstall Windows XP? Well, you'll have to explain the situation to Microsoft, and beg the company to allow you to activate it again. What's more, Windows will keep monitoring your setup to check that it's still running on the same machine. If you make major hardware changes, the system could disable Windows and force you to check in with Microsoft in the mistaken belief the program has been transferred to another computer. As Mossberg writes: I'm not making this up!! Someone emailed me yesterday about this: "I respectfully offer but one word of counsel: urlLink Linux ." I'm glad somebody said it!
And I used to think I was cool... Over at the Todd Compound, neighbors Todd, Dave, Matt and Blake are all smug about their 3Com Wireles LAN. Information comes in off the network at high speed and screams through our house network at 11 MB a second. Hard to beat that! Oops... a Japanese company called urlLink Victor is releasing a new 100 MB a second system. It only works line of sight as an optical network and it costs a lot more. But that's the end of us being smug. About time, huh? And speaking of wireless... urlLink Cringely has found a way to cobble together his own long-distance wireless LAN. hmmm... try this at home? or not? _______ WHEN is Windows XP RC1 releasing?!?!?!? I can't take it! The last communication from MSFT was that we'd see it in June/July. Well, the window is half closed. The rumor is that we'll see it this week or next. Until then, I have to content myself with the new AOL 7.0 beta.
Thursday night... and oh, is life sweet. No prep needed for work tomorrow. So... that means hang out time with the roommate, watching some less than exhilarating preseason football on urlLink ESPN and thinking ahead to when the real football season starts with urlLink NCAA action. Friday, Chris and I will leave for urlLink Washington, D.C. Chris is moving out there for urlLink school , so we'll be getting him settled in and then I'll be coming back on Sunday. Here and There Steve and other friends have been sending me links... good and evil. So enjoy at your own risk... some pretty funny stuff! You'd probably be wearing a mullet if you made a purchase from urlLink this site . urlLink This will turn Meg Whitman's head over at e-Bay. Steve's words are so appropriate for urlLink this site : For the love of God, who would buy this for their kids?!?!?! Finally... from Jake comes some urlLink beautiful old maps in high resolution.
My friends Keith and Martin are going to be featured on an upcoming HGTV show! They're the owners of urlLink \Aut\ BAR . It's a bar for GLBT people and friends and family in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Apparently, a new HGTV show "A Place Called Home" will feature locations in good ole A2... including the bar. So here's the deal: they're going to shoot there Wednesday 8/15 at 12N. You regulars know \Aut\ isn't open then. But it will be this week. If you're in the Ann Arbor area, and want a shot at your own moment on HGTV, stop by \Aut\ for the special brunch this Wednesday, 12N-2pm. Here's an even better deal... half the sales go to PFLAG. While I'm at it... Congrats to Keith and Martin on the 6th anniversary of \Aut\BAR!
This might be a little heavy for a Monday, but a reader sent this to me over the weekend and I think it shows the sadness of someone faced with a dark secret that he couldn't reveal to others. This poem written by the reader's uncle. It was found in his college dorm room after he committed suicide at the age of 18 in 1925. I wandered o'er the sloping hills Wondering where to find life's thrills I thought of the things drear and sad That had made life for me what it had. I remembered the taint of the city's glare The flash of lights, the trumpet's blare The noisy streets, the continual din The paths of men that lead to sin. I considered the rural districts' charm But to me t'was but the drudge of the farm Where man must work his hands to the bone To procure a living for himself alone. In country and city, I can find no rest And life dogs my footsteps like a pest. Ah--to my befuddled brain a plan--a plan! Tomorrow night--the broken span. It's a sad poem and I guess for me, it reminds me of the pain that so many people experience in coming to terms with being gay. The writer penned this poem more than 75 years ago. But unfortunately, many people dealing with this issue feel the same sense of hopelessness now.
Friday... How do I love thee? Let me count the ways!! It's not been a particularly long week-- and remember I had Wednesday off-- but I've been looking forward to today for at least 48 hours and so at last here I am with the weekend upon me. How will I celebrate it? Well, I have an annoying ass company picnic to attend on Sunday. So that just puts the icing on the cake! I skipped out last year, so skipping this year isn't an option. And no one will believe I'm sick. My endlessly cool friend Joe sent me urlLink this today. It's a good story... but let me draw your attention to the picture of the protester holding the signs. I love it that the one anti-gay protester pictured is a total rube holding signs written in crayon with a word crossed out. If only all of our enemies were this dangerous. Joe is a PR guy in Milwaukee... a handsome guy with the drive to accomplish a lot in this life. Actually, he's doing enough for 3 lives. He reminded me this morning that we gave each other our first outdoor, semi-public kiss back in March of 99. Ah the memories... :) Alright it was dark outside so no one else saw. But it felt daring. Joe is taken, btw... so eat your hearts out, single boys!
Just a quick note to say hi! I had a great time at the birthday party last night... a bunch of friends and some good food-- and yes, some ice cream. It was a rollicking good time... and now my day off is over and it's time to get back to work. Dang... Tonight is a quiet night at the ranch... Dave and I are watching " urlLink Unbreakable ." If you haven't seen it you must! Chris and I watched it this last weekend.
I said last week I didn't want to hear analysis or tributes of the bombing... I was at my absolute limit. I still am... but I have to draw your attention a piece about urlLink Mark Bingham . Mark is one of the victims of United flight 93... which went down in Pennsylvania. But "victim" is hardly the right word for Mark. From what we can tell, Mark was one of a small group of passengers who tried to take control of the plane from the hijackers-- to prevent it from hitting its target-- quite possibly the White House or the Capitol. Mark was gay, a rugby, football and basketball player from San Francisco. urlLink Outsports features tributes to Mark... but don't miss the urlLink piece by Brent Mullins. If you urlLink email Brent ... tell him I sent you.
... that I've been silent here for a very long time. But frankly, I don't have that much to say, at this point, about what's happened this week. It might be that I've simply seen so much coverage-- and anchored some of it myself-- that I literally have nothing to add. So, you can considered yourself spared of a long, introspective think piece. My friends in New York City and Washington are safe. Others that I know aren't so fortunate.
Here's the latest essay about life in London. It comes from my friend, Rick, who's on assignment there for a technology and communications company. Mixed Media 11/29/01 London Yesterday I visited the BBC-- or at least part of it-- at Television Centre in White City, away from the center of London where the Underground rises into the daylight. The Queen had been there just ahead of me for some sort of occasion, so I was briefly and erroneously flattered by the large turnout of security personnel in my honor. Television Centre is a 1950s-era circular building that has been added to over the years in the form of a couple of large wings. A few months ago a powerful car bomb exploded at the curb on Wood Lane, shattering the glass front several stories high and doing considerable damage to another BBC building across the street and perhaps 500 yards away. It was a big bomb. Now the front is boarded up and covered with scaffolding, while crews construct some sort of bombproof skin. Inside, the business of broadcasting goes on as usual. What was once a light and airy interior is more like a cave. On the second floor I visited the largest sports newsroom in the world. I was impressed, and I don't have any interest in sports at all. Amid row after row of desks and computer terminals, scores of reporters and editors hustled back and forth servicing television, domestic and overseas radio, and BBC Sport Online. In one corner a television reporter did a live update, while a radio presenter read a brief report with his head tucked into a wooden box built over his desk for acoustic purposes. It is ironic that a single nation could produce such a range of media styles. The home of the staid and serious BBC, the steady voice of reason and comfort in war and peace for much of the 20th Century, has also misbegot such progeny as shrieking tabloids and slapstick television comedy that makes Vaudeville look like Greek tragedy. And America often snaps it up. The other night I watched the original "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" that ABC and Regis Philbin appropriated for US audiences. The host here, Chris Tarrant, is genuinely witty and urbane-- nothing, in other words, like Regis, who can't even pronounce half the answers to the questions. The contestants are still better, coming from what seems an endless supply of dotty competitors for whom the nation seems to serve as Central Casting. On this episode a woman battled her way through one question after another, determined not to use her lifelines but forced to do so when the topics were foreign to her. She was completely stumped when asked, "What sport does Shaquill O'Neal play?" She complained under her breath that the topics were not the ones she'd hoped for, then muttered, "I don't know, but she sounds Irish." In the end, she managed to guess her way out of her predicament, and ultimately walked away with £250,000, probably into the waiting arms of the Exchequer. -- Rick
Here's the latest essay about life in London. It comes from my friend, Rick, who's on assignment there for a technology and communications company. The Weekend 11/25/01 London Last night I strolled along Tottenham Court Road, poking into endless bookshops, and observing the spikey-haired punks arrayed along the street, with enough metal piercings and rivets to spin compasses and ground steamships against the white cliffs of Dover. But they were harmless enough, and more evidence that this seems like a safe city as much as anything. The other night in Leicester Square I saw a neatly-painted sign, about four feet tall. It was a message from the police, seeking information from the public about an incident last month in which an Asian man had been hit on the head with a bottle and later died. It seemed an awfully polite form of investigation, and one any number of suspects in cities like Los Angeles and New York would prefer over the traditional rubber-hose approach. Today in an Underground station I heard an announcement--not for the first time on this trip--that a station was closed temporarily for investigation of a suspicious package found on a train. After years of experience with exploding cars and trash cans due to the "troubles" in Northern Ireland, they have learned to handle threats with a large degree of aplomb. More to the point, they routinely take the public into their confidence. On the last two Sundays I have visited two of London's biggest gift shops: the British Museum and Harrod's. Today was the day for the latter, once I deciphered the Tube map-- from Oxford Circus on the Victoria Line to Green Park, then on the Picadilly Line to Knightsbridge. It took just minutes and helped amortize the outrageous cost of my monthly transport pass. I had no idea what Herrod's looked like, but I knew it the moment I saw it: a six-story domed brownstone behemoth, decorated with stylized Christmas trees and looming imperiously over the snazzy fashion shops all around it. On the two sides facing the street, the fine art of window dressing is alive and well. Inside, it's the best job of set decorating since "Miracle on 34th Street" cheered a war-weary nation in the year I was born. This is what a proper department store should look like. The decorations were so big and bold they looked like they had to be permanent. There was music discreetly piped into just certain rooms, and only quiet murmuring in a dozen languages elsewhere. The prices are beyond the reach of anyone I know. The Egyptian Room offers fabulous jewelry and a soaring gold Sphinx (no photos please). The Luxury Hall--oddly singled out in this edifice of excess--has purses individually displayed in glass cases like museum exhibits for a thousand dollars and more. I saw a Mont Blanc advent calendar--a sort of giant doll house with many doors--for half a million pounds. Down in the basement food court, there are steaks, grouse, cheeses, all looking like they were wrapped by jewelers and priced accordingly. Parents and children stood in a long line on the fifth floor to see Father Christmas, who was himself ensconced in a mirrored hall behind double doors and invisible to those not accompanied by children. Nearby, an overdressed woman chatted on a cell phone while rocking a baby carriage the size of my car, and probably worth considerably more. I couldn't believe anyone would bring such a contraption into a crowded store. It's the people-watching, after all, that makes this city so fascinating. On the upper deck of the bus the other night, an older man laden with shopping bags tripped as he walked up the aisle, thanks to a younger man taking up an entire double sat as well as the aisle. I had almost tripped over him myself. The man with the bags collapsed into an empty seat, cursing the first man as clumsy, uncaring, discourteous, and worse. The other man began talking back, his feet still planted in the aisle, and the two proceeded to goad each other into an ever higher state of distress. The older man waved his old-age pensioner bus pass in the air. The younger man didn't care. Then suddenly the tension began to ease. The older man actually thanked the younger one, who turned out to be Italian, for helping to get his blood pressure up so he would be motivated to write, which he said was his profession. By the time we got to my stop, less than ten minutes later, the two had become fast friends, and the writer was reciting and explaining his poetry to the other. Go figure. England, its armadas and colonies long gone, is still nothing if not a civil and civilized place. When I was in Amsterdam last year, I thought the famously-tolerant Dutch were really more disinterested and self-absorbed than anything. But perhaps it's the English who are the tolerant ones. Their empire may be a bit worn around the edges, and their plumbing unarguably disastrous, but if there is one thing the centuries can not take away, it is class. -- Rick
My friend Rick is in London on business. From time to time, he writes about his experiences there. I'll be sharing several of his essays here... and I imagine they'll continue even after he returns home to Washington, D.C. Here's his latest post: Pied Piper Wanted 11/23/01 London Another typical, non-holiday week in London is coming to a close, meaning that every Londoner in sight has rushed to the nearest pub and left me in peace at the office. I can take a moment to gaze out the window at the lamplit greensward of Soho Square, with its quaint Tudor gazebo that I learned today is a disguised vent for the Underground's Picadilly Line. Nearby Marshall Street is built over a mass graveyard of victims of the Great Plague of 1665, so there's no telling what else is being vented. The rats I've seen scampering between the rails in the Tube station don't look anything like a sinister, confident, cat-sized New York City rat that could carry a switchblade and enough diseased fleas to knock off half the population of a large 17th Century city. Then again, who knows what a Plague-bearing rat is supposed to look like? I, for one, do not plan to fraternize with them. That means I'd better stay out of the restroom of a basement Indian restaurant I visited last Sunday, where it appeared the last working janitor was a loyal subject of Charles II and is probably buried under Marshall Street. This weekend I have to face the recalcitrant washing machine. The cleaning lady kindly left written instructions for deciphering the ancient Egyptian pictographs on the control knobs. As any idiot could guess, "4" is the setting for "all fabrics," and "1/2" means both wash and dry. "G" means something else. No one told the poor woman the contraption is broken anyway, with the defective part back-ordered 'til St. Swivens Day. The only alternative is to run a load of laundry, manually turning the dial through each cycle until the clothes are done or the building is in flames. After the first failure, I took six shirts and a pair of slacks to the cleaners around the corner (across from the Lebanese turnip store), and explained to the chatty proprietor my dilemma back at the flat. "Good luck for me then," he observed, handing me a bill for $24. I guess it was. I've given up on getting the toilet repaired. It just seems to flush when it feels like it, which is about 20% of the time. I think it was manufactured around the time of the Magna Carta, which is Latin for "bad plumbing." So was the brass faucet set whose knobs and levers knock together when operated. And the dark, deep maw of the old-fashioned garbage disposal in the kitchen sink--the kind where you put the lid in and turn it to start--well, it just frightens me. I'm pretty sure there are Plague victims down there too. But if I survive all that, it's supposed to be a sunny and cool weekend, and I think I'll join the throngs of shoppers on the streets and see what they are seeing. Maybe I'll even find a cheap ticket to some interesting place for Christmas. So far the holiday schedule is a total mystery. -- Rick
One final essay from my friend Rick, who is saying goodbye to London and preparing to return to America. Happy Christmas and Goodbye 12/21/01 During the last six weeks here I've found myself pondering such weighty matters as the plundering of antiquities, rampant video surveillance, bad restaurant service and The Plague. I've thought about faulty plumbing, the spectacle of Herrods at Christmastime, and the oddities of British television. There is a fine line between an eclectic mind, and one that is merely indiscriminate. Whatever the truth, I've been looking over a few remaining scraps of notes, and I realize that no one who's made a transitory hobby of taking cheap shots at London can leave town without commenting on the language. For both better and worse, England's English is in a class by itself. Like any foreign language, some of it is often misunderstood by Americans. "Cheers," for instance, usually means "thanks," not "goodbye." "Cheerio" would mean "goodbye" if anyone ever said it, but they do not. Streets known as "mews" are lined with houses that used to be stables. They are as trendy to their yuppie residents as New York City lofts are to theirs. The term dates back to the early 1800s. "Swede" is turnips. Don't get fooled by that one. "Bangers and mash" are a popular meal of sausages, mashed potatoes and gravy?often gravy from a can. The potatoes are called "champ" if made from the Irish recipe, using green onions and lots of milk. It's a feast that must rush to the aorta like a guided missile. If the RAF had carpet-bombed the Nazis with bangers and mash, those few Germans not brained with cans of gravy would have died soon thereafter of congestive heart failure, and the war would have ended by 1942 at the latest. English can be eloquent beyond all reason, as in this formal note pushed through the mail slot of my flat: "We write to advise you than Andrew will be on holiday for the period 17 December ? 6 January. In his absence normal arrangements regarding temporary cover will be in hand, however you will no doubt appreciate that such cover will be restrictive over Christmas and the New Year. We trust however that no unforeseen problems will arise." Translation: "The janitor is going on vacation. Carry out your own trash." What do you expect from a people who can be introduced to someone named Nigel without cracking a smile? But English is at its apogee of impenetrability, I believe, when combined with reporting on the incomprehensible game of cricket. Behold this single stunning sentence from a news account: "Hoggard claimed three wickets for 65 runs to pin down Indian hopes of overtaking England's first innings score of 336, leaving the home team struggling at 218 for seven at the draw of stumps." They might as well be describing a convention of Martian physicists. For six weeks I have been steeped?happily, for the most part?in curiosities of language, weather, commerce, cuisine (I ate a grilled kidney and lived), art, and tradition. I walked through big department stores and quaint back streets, rode a lot of double-decker buses, and logged quite a few kilometers on the Tube. I never got to Buckingham Palace, though in a way, I feel I've even had a brush with royalty. You see, the bathroom lights in our office are switched on by a motion sensor. A couple of seconds after you throw open the door to the pitch-black room, bright light floods the space in response to your very presence. Now I know how it feels to be King. -- Rick
A new essay now from my friend Rick. He's in London on assignment for a technology and communications company. Our Lunch with the Inmates at the Asylum Charenton 12/12/01 London Lunch at Pollo Pasta began unremarkably at our cramped booth next to the kitchen door. It was, after all, an indifferent little restaurant tucked into a small space on a narrow street in Soho. A quick and easy lunch, we figured, and then back to the office. The experience would fade from memory in an instant, like a thousand other rushed repasts. We didn't expect The Ritz, and in that sense, we were not disappointed. In hindsight, it's difficult to remember the precise moment when things started to go so hopelessly wrong that they would eventually cross the line to hilarious, and beyond. Our first clue should have been the countenance of the harried waitress, who approached our table clutching the menus. She looked like a wild-eyed rabbit being stalked by a ferret. If she didn't actually have a nervous twitch, she probably does by now. She left the menus and dashed away as chaotic crashes behind the kitchen door got our attention. Four heads swiveled toward the new sound. (Now, much later, I seem to hear veteran moviegoers whispering, "Run, run! She's a vampire, you idiot!") The door, it should be said, was a heavy wooden slab that looked more like a barricade than a passageway. There was a horizontal slot cut across it about waist-high, and on the inside could be glimpsed a countertop where plates of food were placed for pickup by the waitstaff and delivery to the tables. Another slot below it was a depository for dirty dishes. It resembled an armored box office. We soon learned by observation that the cooks (or blacksmiths, or whatever they were) signaled the waitresses by pounding on the other side of the door--not gently or subtly, but with ham-fisted blows that evoked images of Boris Karloff trying to escape his dungeon. The waitress came to take our orders: two soups, an avocado appetizer, two orders of garlic bread, and four pastas. She scribbled this on the ticket and shoved it into the big slot, where an invisible hand took it away into the darkness. Twenty minutes passed, as we watched the surrounding scene become ever more frantic and disorganized. The whole business seemed to unravel before our eyes with dizzying speed. The waitresses would come to the barricade, bend over, and shout through the slot at the unseen cooks beyond--sometimes in English, sometimes Italian, and once in Russian. It was obvious that some orders were wrong, and most were just late. Customers in other booths were glowering at their empty tabletops with hooded eyes. Our waitress, now wearing a dangerous expression, finally approached us with two bowls of soup. "Here is your spinach soup," she said to one of our colleagues. "I ordered cream of asparagus soup," he replied, not unkindly. She offered him a glazed stare. "We don't have any asparagus soup," she said evenly. "But it is on the menu." "I know." Something in her crazily calm face muzzled him, and he shrank back into the corner of the booth. He took the soup--a watery gruel of chopped spinach and thin broth--without argument. It was awful, he soon reported. By this time plates of pasta could be seen crowding together on the shelf behind the slot, their clotted sauces growing cold. The waitresses repeatedly came to shout angrily at the cooks through the slot, spraying spittle on the spaghetti. We heard a waitress negotiate with the restless people in the booth behind us. "If you want to leave now, it's OK," she confided. "You don't have to pay. But why not stay and see if it comes in time?" Moments later their orders finally did come, and they dug into them. The waitress returned with bad news. "I checked with the cook, and since you're eating it, now you do have to pay." Another woman--possibly the manager--actually opened the big door and went inside. We could hear her shouting over and over, in a Wagnerian tone, "Is anyone working in the kitchen for the first time today? Anyone!?" Getting no answer we could detect, she finally tramped out and slammed the heavy door behind her. Cold plates rattled on the shelf in her wake. I began to imagine that the kitchen was really that of a competing restaurant, where evil chefs had sawed the slots through the door in an effort to confuse and ultimately ruin the business of Pollo Pasta. Only two plates of pasta (still not ours) remained on the shelf. The Colossus of Rhodes thudded his fists against the drawbridge. Another waitress stomped up to the door in an exasperated huff and grabbed the servings of congealed carbonara, jerking them out through the slot just as a backstage cook tried the aerial application of a fistful of finely chopped parsley. The intended garnish missed the fast-departing food entirely, shooting out of the slot and drifting onto the floor like a cloud of green snow. This is the kind of moment that makes milk come out of a schoolkid's nose. It just got better from then on. One angry waitress returned two plates of food to argue with the cooks that they had sent her to the wrong table. "They tasted the food at Table 4," she screamed, "and it's not theirs!" They informed her the orders were for a table downstairs, whereupon she picked up the nibbled servings and carried them off again toward unsuspecting diners. We began to appreciate our vantage point at the kitchen door. The rest was anticlimax. Our food did arrive after about an hour, and it was cold and tasted like flour. The piece de resistance, a plate of garlic bread, was delivered by an exhausted and shamefaced waitress who knew we didn't want it any more and took it back instantly. But we didn't care. Once we realized this was performance art, and not lunch, we couldn't have been more pleased. It was the new Blue Man Group. We rose to our feet with cries of "Author, author!" and promised to nominate them for the International Venice Biennale Award for Performance Art. The similar Turner Prize was wasted just this week in London on Martin Creed, a man who created a bare room illuminated with lights that flash every five seconds. Judges praised the installation's "strength, rigor, wit and sensitivity to the site." Flapdoodle. This was lots better. We paid our £5.50 apiece with gratitude and returned to our desks as patrons of the arts, refreshed, challenged and spiritually fulfilled. -- Rick
Here's Rick's latest essay from London. He's on assignment there for a technology and communications company. Smile! 12/7/01 London It would be a delicious irony to find a security camera trained on George Orwell's grave in Oxfordshire. The sunken little grassy plot in Sutton Courtenay Churchyard may be one of the last places in England without closed circuit TV surveillance. Even Orwell said the things he described in "1984" and other writings "could happen." Some of them have. Big Brother is on every busy street in the places where pickpockets and other footpads flourish. There are at least two cameras aboard every big red double-decker bus, and presumably an onboard videotape recorder. Our own smallish office has ten. They're in a smoked glass dome on the convenience store ceiling. Alert shopkeepers with walkie-talkies can track a fast-moving picaroon down the block like radar, and the CCTV tapes will have him slapped in the Tower of London before he can say "Miranda." It didn't occur to me to expect this in London, and it was quite awhile before I even noticed it. But the British market for CCTV systems was £250 million last year. One shopping center alone is said to have 700 cameras, and security people to watch them. "The UK's CCTV market is very advanced and mature compared with those of other countries," crows an industry Website. "It enjoyed a boom in the mid-1990s, when many large city-centre surveillance schemes were set up." (The word "scheme" doesn't have the pejorative connotation here that it does in the U.S.) The government is foursquare behind all this, and in fact, responsible for a lot of it. The current round of Home Office grants for community CCTV security systems will distribute £108 million to set up thousands of new cameras. It's no surprise that present-day watchdogs find this to be positively Orwellian. A civil liberties group running the Website www.spy.org.uk is campaigning for the enactment of rules for the proper use of spy cameras. They cite, for example, the case of a man who attempted suicide in front of a surveillance camera. The tape later found its way onto a TV show, to the horror of his relatives. The government says the cameras serve as an extra pair of eyes to protect the public. Opponents wonder whose eyes, what they're watching, and what happens to the information they gather. Orwell wrote, "If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face?forever." England today seems far too civilized for that kind of thing, but he may have been prescient about the role of pictures in post-1984 society. Big Brother, thy name is Alan Funt. -- Rick
Here's my friend Rick's latest essay from London. He's on assignment there for a technology and communications company Playing for Keeps 12/2/01 London While America still sleeps, I'm back from my second visit to the British Museum. It's the capacious attic of an empire that once looted the world without apology, stole the treasures of ancient civilizations, hauled them back, and put them on display alongside quite a few of their mummified former citizens. There are whole walls of Egyptian tombs and statues of pharaohs the size of elephants, and stone sarcophagi that could hold an elephant apiece. This is not the archeological equivalent of petty shoplifting. Mammoth slabs of carving from the Parthenon, known as the Parthenon Marbles, line the walls of an entire gallery, and the Greeks have wanted them back for 150 years. The Trustees of the British Museum have steadfastly refused. Lord Byron sided with the Greeks: Dull is the eye that will not weep to see Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed By British hands, which it had best behoved To guard those relics ne'er to be restored. Curst be the hour when from their isle they roved, And once again thy hapless bosom gored, And snatch'd thy shrinking gods to northern climes abhorred! But the Museum still has all its Marbles. High relief carvings of Greek warriors, forever frozen in the death-grip of Centaurs, remain bolted to the walls in a gallery designed to be drab so as not to compete with the luminous beauty of the carvings. Awed tourists shuffle past, whispering. Don't get me wrong; I'm not sure this kind of cultural plundering is an altogether bad idea. I suppose I should be outraged by it. The British have been judged for generations as a nation of rapacious kleptomaniacs. Still, I was able to walk a few blocks on a Sunday morning and see in a couple of hours what I wouldn't gaze upon in a lifetime of travels. So did hundreds of other people. The swag is beautifully displayed in spacious chambers. Carvings worn by wind or desert sands are protected now, and delicate shards of ancient art won't risk breakage again. It's a lucky mummy that rests in a climate-controlled glass case after three thousand years in a musty pyramid. In chamber upon vaulted chamber of African headdresses, 17th Century clocks, Chinese jewelry, Babylonian swords and other spolia opima, the history of the human race is on display for all to see. If it were locked up somewhere, it might be a different story. But when you look around and see throngs of children, and hear foreign languages spoken all around you, it's obvious these relics are being put to good use without being put in danger. In a perfect world, all these treasures would have stayed where they came from, preserved from the elements and from us. In a perfect world, centuries-old Buddhas wouldn't be blown up in Afghanistan by religious fanatics. So score one for the British this time. They didn't abandon the Empire. They packed it in their steamer trunks and brought it home. But they shared. -- Rick
... I've rejoined it. DSL is back on at home. May Ameritech be praised! Oh my God... I just said that?!?!? Well, at least it's back. The speed seems to be better than ever, too-- up above 1.5 Mbps for downloads at times. Ah yes... more speed for those horrible, illegal music downloads that are crippling the music industry-- filled with honest, hardworking executives interested only in the welfare of their beloved artists. Yup, you got it.
Snow makes me all goofy. ot because I particularly like it. But in my job, it's a more busy time because of school cancellations and road delays and such. And I like departures from normal. Speaking of which, here are some weird links... First of all... urlLink any of you boys going out this weekend? Second... and urlLink this will bring a tear to your eye . Not because of the faithful attempt this person has made to recreate a great mythic tale. But mainly because his unemployment check is probably going to run out soon. Best of luck, Harlow... or whatever your name is. DSL Down Day 5 At this point, it's just a matter of getting the crew over to the place to get the line fixed. But that's like pulling teeth, from what I can tell. Bottom line... and we all know it: the telcos HATE offering DSL service. They hate offering DSL service through other providers even more.
Hey everyone! Thanks for all the notes and e-cards wishing me well. The fever and stuff has held on for a long time-- longer than I'm used to-- but I think it's finally licked. As of this morning, all I have is a sore throat... and not a bad one at that. So that's one problem taken care of. Here's the other problem... my Internet connection. I'll keep this story short and relatively rant-free. SBC Ameritech sent a guy over Thursday to fix my phone line. He fixed it, but in doing so, broke my 1.5 Mbps DSL connection. He was only trained in POTS so he had no idea how to fix it. So I'm without my normal DSL connection till sometime next week. In the meantime, I'm borrowing from my neighbor's wireless connection. It gets me high speed access out-- which I need for work. But the connectivity is unstable because I'm at the edge of his service area. Why am I telling you all this? Some of you IM me on AIM. Others IM on Windows Messenger. I'm getting knocked out of both services as signal strength varies. Each one then logs me back on when it can. AIM returns with the proper "away" message. Windows Messenger hasn't always been doing this. So if you IM me on Messenger because it looks like I'm there... chances are good I'm not. Email is the best way to reach me over the next few days. Thanks!
My friend Chris... who is 32 yo today... HAPPY BIRTHDAY! ... sent me this email he received. Somehow, it strikes me as quite funny, depending on how you read it. Chris- Just wanted to let you know that I will be having a musical evening tomorrow, Tues. A blues singer and an Afghani musician are trying out together to see if there's any synergy. Shouldn't go too late. Hope you're having a great weekend! I'm trying to recover from a bad fever...
My friend Chris IM'ed me today with this gem from a student's paper: "War leads to death which will mean the loss of human life." So let that be a lesson to all of us... - - - What else today? Not too much. Dave sent me this urlLink funny piece from CNN about gay penguins . Be good... go to bed early... often... and preferably with someone else.
This Will Get Your Goat... ... until you realize that it's just urlLink a parody . And a pretty good one at that. Be sure to take the urlLink Virtual Tour .
Gosh... you know... ... it's been a long time since I've blatantly stolen something from someone else's weblog. So let's rectify that right now. urlLink Brad Graham publishes some pretty entertaining and thoughtful stuff on his urlLink website . A few days ago, he offered this to his readers: Ten Actual Titles of Gay Adult Videos Raiders of the Lost Arse: The Mummy's Hand Do Me, Ray! and A Few of His Favorite Things Dawson's Crack Going Down and Putting Out in Beverly Hills I Dream of Weenie Star Track: Voyeur Star Track: Deep Nine Inches The Best Little Whorehouse in TEX-ASS Terms of Endowment I Know Who You Did Last Summer Enjoy... either just the titles or the cinematic wonders these titles represent. Here's a plug for urlLink Jockohomo . He lives in Cleveland, where he maintains a great physique, good sense of humor, excellent urlLink website and a urlLink cute black dog . I like his take on things. And quite often, I just enjoy the way he writes... the way his words go together. Some people can write the weather forecast and it's compelling. Books to Live By Love is the Killer App by Tim Sanders I had no intention of recommending this book. My initial impression was that it was yet another one of those "get close to the customer... give them an experience... share stuff" kinds of books. Tim Sanders of Yahoo! talks about all of the above. But first of all there is his zeal... his sheer enthusiasm about his subject. And second, he brings these concepts right into your career and your life. One of the keys to success is knowledge. Tim reads books like a maniac. And he's written a brilliant section about why we have to be voracious about consuming knowledge... processing it... mining the gold... and then sharing it with others. His section about what to read, why, when and how... is worth the price of the book. He does the same thing with the tired mantra about networking. He freshens it with a some good advice about how to network... what to do with those contacts-- and, and I think this is great-- how to use your contacts to bring people together. It's not all about me. It's about how I can enrich my life and my circle of friends and colleagues at the same time. Some of the stuff here is old hat. Some of it's brilliant. And through it all is Tim's missionary-like enthusiasm.
Couples, Singles Agree: Screw You... apropos my tongue-in-cheek comments on 2/14... My friend Jeremy writes: Valentine's Day is overrated, even if you do have a partner. Ed and I both agreed to not bother--that probably makes us bad Americans or something, since we're not blindly buying things to stimulate the economy--but the idea of a designated day-to-be-romantic is kind of silly when the relationship's already going well. Apparently, I have a group of high quality friends because none of them blindly bought anything for me to stimulate the economy. :) So how was your weekend? Mine was decent... so why am I just spitting nails today? I don't know... maybe it's because I'm anxious to get away from the work environment. A trip to the gym should calm me down. I have a long week ahead, including an interview with Madeleine Albright. Watch for me LIVE on C-SPAN (home of 6 viewers) on Thursday afternoon!
As a single gay man... allow me to say screw all of you partnered people!! No, no, no... I'm just kidding. But let's face it. If you're a single guy or woman, this day isn't exactly made to showcase you. Some people hold big parties for singles on Valentine's Day. I guess the idea is to get yourself set up so you don't have to go to the singles party next year. However, I don't know any of those people. So... it's a DIY thing for me this year. I'm inviting some of my favorite single friends to go out to eat with me tonight. I did something like this last year, even though I was dating at the time. We'll do it at urlLink Aut , the local gay bar and grill... so that way if my friends see a nice young man, they can begin making plans not to be there next year! Heck, I might do the same! I put in my vote for Chicken Marsala... and I think that's going to be on the menu tonight. And since it's Valentine's Day... you can bet I'm going to have dessert!
I wish they would go on and on and on... This has probably been one of the better weekends in some time. And I haven't done a damn thing. Tomorrow, I'll be getting back into the work week. I have plenty of studying to do for the week ahead. And I have a big project that involves reading just about everything I can get my hands on about Madeline Albright. It's for something I'm doing with her later this month. But you know what? That's tomorrow. Tonight I'm sitting at Sweetwater's Cafe and doing some people-watching. So, you know how they always talk about how if a guy pulls out his cell phone, every other guy at the table will do the same? Everyone talks about how it's all about comparing penises or something. Well... women do it, too. And you can see it if you watch for it. There are 3 women sitting at a table in front of me right now. One of them is named Buffy. She looks like a Buffy. Buffy takes out her phone and loudly makes a call. Cari and Summer (she looks like she'd be named for a season-- or maybe a flower) both pull out their phones and look at them. Cari polishes her phone with her sleeve like it's a piece of fine crystal. Or some such heirloom. Summer clicks through her address book... trying to think of someone she can call. That's exactly what I would do. Except that when someone near me pulls out their phone and I feel that impulse (it's totally genetic) I try to resist it. I feel like I'm overcoming some base impulse when I do this. I'm probably just fooling myself because, seconds later, I'll reach for my Palm. Actually, Summer talks loudly enough that the person she's calling can probably hear her without the phone. It's puzzling because she sneezes very quietly. Hmmmm.... time to move on.
After nearly 40 years... the urlLink BBC has dropped the globe as the primary symbol of its main channel, BBC One. Beginning today, urlLink BBC One will identify itself with video featuring urlLink dancers at various locations around the UK . The globe has been a continuing presence since 1963. In 1997, the BBC introduced urlLink the balloon concept ... a globe hot air balloon traveling over the British Isles. We see these idents in this country on urlLink BBC America and on BBC programs on PBS.
I realize it was 20 years ago. I realize that 3.5 billion people have seen the film. I understand that bushpeople from remote Australian tribes, who don't have TV and have never owned a Sony product, have seen it. The fact remains: I've never seen urlLink E.T. But tonight, all that changes. My bf, his 5 yo son and three other witnesses will be with me as I watch E.T. for the first time. Oh... and while you're still shocked... I just saw urlLink The Godfather for the first time this weekend. Here's the deal: I grew up in a very religious household, where going to the movies was frowned upon. We watched TV. And when certain movies came to TV, my brothers and I were allowed to watch them. The problem, as far as I can tell, was the theater-- and it wasn't the inflated candy prices. My mom and dad seemed to believe that dark theaters were places where things happened that wouldn't be happening if the theater were lit like an operating room. Now as young kids, we had no idea what this meant. Heck, I'm 34 and I still don't really know. This must have meant courtin' and sparkin'. Or whatever those randy kids call it today. So... I was in a theater to see a movie probably 3 times in the first 21 years of my life-- I kid you not. One of those times was to see "The Ten Commandments." Another time was to see " urlLink In Search of Noah's Ark ." This was the epic documentary detailing the evidence that Noah's Ark is still up on Mount Ararat, remarkably preserved. Oh yes, there it is, we murmured as our eyes tried to bore holes through the grainy, blurry photographs of some strange blob on the side of Ararat. For all I know, it was the Loch Ness Monster. It's remarkable that people can afford to travel to remote parts of the world in search of answers to the great mysteries of our time... and neglect to buy a quality zoom lens.
I'm so happy to reach the weekend... even though it seems like just the calm before the storm. Next week is going to be packed with work. My boyfriend's son will be here for the week, too... and that inevitably tempts me to spend long hours coloring, building Legos and playing dinosaurs with him. Those hours will be in short supply next week!
Sorry... ... about such a long period of silence. These are busy times. I owe many cool people some long emails... Michael... urlLink Jockohomo ... many more. Here's a cool interview with urlLink Moby from the New York Times urlLink this last weekend. He's one of those guys I feel I have to talk to, for some apparent reason. Check it out. Had a great time in Toronto over the weekend. I think I spent more time waiting to get in and out of the country, than I actually spent enjoying the city. But I got a glimpse of Toronto and D. and I are planning to return sometime soon to explore the city more. Yes, I know... I've never been to Toronto even though I live just about 4 hours away. I've never been to Disneyland either... so shoot me. :) I had a good time with D. Have you ever felt like you know someone so well and love him so much and yet you can't wait to be next to him again because you just know you're going to discover something new? We'll have known each other as friends for a year on Thursday. We've spent a year as best friends and confidantes before taking steps to something romantic. I've wanted it for a long time, but it was worth the wait.
It never ceases to amaze me. One day you're single and you're searching for a guy as warm and confident and challenging and handsome as the guy you can't have. And the next day, the guy you can't have says, "time and time again the smoke seems to clear and the reality is consistently you." I still don't really know what's going on. But then, who does...
Here it is... and sadly not a lot of time just for Todd. I'm such a time hoarder. :) Honestly, though, I have a urlLink book that I'd like to read this weekend and I'm not sure how much I'm going to be accomplish. And tonight, I'm narrating "Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra" with the urlLink Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra . It should be a great time and I have a special script to read, written by urlLink Edward Yadzinsky in Buffalo. I'm told he's driving in to A2 to see tonight's performance, so it will be cool to meet him. Here's something kind of fun sent to me by my friend Rick: Oil Change instructions for Women: 1) Pull up to Jiffy Lube when the mileage reaches 3000 miles since the last oil change. 2) Drink a cup of coffee. 3) 15 minutes later, write a check and leave with a properly maintained vehicle Money spent: Oil Change $20.00 Coffee $ 1.00 Total $21.00 Oil Change instructions for Men: 1) Go to auto parts store and write a check for $40.00 for oil, filter, kitty litter, hand cleaner and a scented tree. 2) Discover that the used oil container is full. Instead of taking it back to O'Reilly to recycle, dump in hole in back yard. 3) Open a beer and drink it. 4) Jack car up. Spend 30 minutes looking for jack stands. 5) Find jack stands under kid's pedal car. 6) In frustration, open another beer and drink it. 7) Place drain pan under engine. 8) Look for 9/16 box end wrench. 9) Give up and use crescent wrench. 10) Unscrew drain plug. 11) Drop drain plug in pan of hot oil: get hot oil on you in process. 12) Clean up mess. 13) Have another beer while watching oil drain. 14) Look for oil filter wrench. 15) Give up; poke oil filter with screwdriver and twist off. 16) Beer. 17) Buddy shows up; finish case of beer with him. Finish oil change tomorrow. 18) Next day, drag pan full of old oil out from underneath car. 19) Throw kitty litter on oil spilled during step 18. 20) Beer. No, drank it all yesterday. 23) Walk to 7-11; buy beer. 22) Install new oil filter making sure to apply a thin coat of oil to gasket surface. 23) Dump first quart of fresh oil into engine. 24) Remember drain plug from step 11. 25) Hurry to find drain plug in drain pan. 26) Discover that the used oil is buried in a hole in the back yard,along with drain plug. 27) Drink beer. 28) Uncover hole and sift for drain plug. 29) Discover that first quart of fresh oil is now on the floor. 30) Drink beer. 31) Slip with wrench tightening drain plug and bang knuckles on frame. 32) Bang head on floorboards in reaction to step 31. 33) Begin cussing fit and throw wrench. 34) Cuss for additional 10 minutes because wrench hit Miss December in the left boob. 35) Beer. 36) Dump in five fresh quarts of oil. 37) Lower car from jack stands and accidentally crush one. 38) Move car back to apply more kitty litter to fresh oil spilled during step 23. 39) Beer. 40) Test drive car. 41) Get pulled over: arrested for driving under the influence. 42) Car gets impounded. 43) Make bail. 44) Get car from impound yard. Money spent: Parts $40.00 DWI $2500.00 Impound fee $75.00 Bail $1500.00 Beer $25.00 Total $4140.00 ----But you know the job was done right
This is must-read material for Wireless people... and all the rest of us, too. As the publisher of the urlLink 802.11b Weblog wrote yesterday, the urlLink New York Times finally gets it. Check out these articles on urlLink community networking and urlLink WiFi's popularity . Wireless is exploding. I live in a building in downtown Ann Arbor, MI. There's my wireless network. My neighbor in the building has his. And the furniture store below us has just created its own network, of all things. But, they have 2 computers-- one in the front of the store and one in the back. So it made sense to network them. These networks are springing up all over. Some of them are protected... and some are open. The equipment is cheap... and believe me, the first moment you can sit anywhere in your house with your laptop and read and write email... you will decide that you can never go back to the wire. Bring it on! Speaking of explosions... urlLink Gnutella has grown about tenfold with the addition of Morpheus.
and it's even better now that urlLink Six Feet Under has returned! Last night was a ratings winner for HBO. And I won't mention anything else that might spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet.
Check out these interesting stories... and do some thinking of your own: Here's a piece about some urlLink radical new interpretations of Islam . The piece is eqully notable because it details the intolerance to new ideas on the part of some in this faith. Sound like any other faiths? hmmm... And another article about urlLink a boy who once was thought a profound genius . Turns out his mom faked a lot of the results. The kid let out a cry for help last fall and that set this whole process of discovery in motion. Check it out. This kid wrote a urlLink syndicated column for awhile. The Brits offer an intelligent take (??) on urlLink America, post 9/11 : Here's a piece from The Guardian that reaches new heights in snobbery-- not to mention awful reporting. Deepest Alabama ? For God's sake... And here's urlLink James Lilek's biting and funny dissection of it.
Got this IM overnight while I was asleep: "Saw your profile on gaywired, think you're a really nice guy." Signed: well hung versatile male . For the purposes of a reply, which part of that is his first name? An early night to bed has left me feeling very good on this Saturday morning. The bf is up north seeing family and I'm enjoying the quiet house and my Classic Saturday Morning ritual: coffee and websurfing next door at the coffeeshop beginning at 8am. Well, this morning it's tea. I love Saturdays with no agenda...
This has been... one of the most intense weeks of the past year for me. There was a ton of work to do. I had a bad case of Spring fever. And I couldn't get more than just the bare-bones workout in all through the week. But Saturday has been a super calm day and I'm looking forward to an evening of nothing but reading, web surfing and general time wasting at the coffee shop. The boyfriend went camping this week along the shores of Lake Superior. He was only gone for a couple days, but he came back so happy and relaxed that I wish I could have gone with him. Plus, he was lucky enough to be able to see the Northern Lights on Wednesday night. It's a pretty strong storm if you can see it in mid-Michigan. The urlLink Naked Mile took place this week. Or at least I think it did. The University of Michigan has been in maximum discouragement mode about this event for the past 3 years or so. I remember at the time people involved with the program thought they'd be able to eliminate the run within 3 years. And as far as I can tell, they've been hugely effective. It still takes place but it's a urlLink shadow of its former self . And media coverage is almost nil. I saw it in 1999, and it was interesting from the point of view of social taboos. I stood up on the roof of a building and watched people finishing the race 5 stories below. There's something almost surreal about seeing people wandering in and out of the Michigan Union... completely naked. There's certainly nothing titillating about it.
... it's the todd modus operandi this week. And it's funny because this is one of my most intense weeks in about a year-- as far as work goes. It must be a case of Spring fever. I have a big book about urlLink Project Orion to read for tomorrow and I've not started it yet. It's great work and it's by George Dyson, who I think is a cool writer. But here I am with time on my hands and no inclination to use it. In any case... check out the Dyson book if you get a chance. I'm sure it's good. And if I stop being such a lazy ass, I'll know for sure!
It's been a while since I last wrote anything. I was in DC for a few days... seeing friends and taking it easy. I read most of " urlLink The Radical Center ." It's a great "new politics and ideas of the 21st century" kind of book. I've really enjoyed it and the ideas it contains-- particularly the section on Social Security. I've also been making additional progress in the urlLink John Adams bio by David McCullough. Now that it's won the Pulitzer Prize, I feel like I should get serious and finish it. I'm less than half way through it at this point. But it's great reading. Sometimes, books go down easier than at other times. Know what I mean? There are some days or periods where even seeing a particular book reminds me how much I don't want to pick it up. But then this past week, I opened the John Adams after letting it sit for several months. I spent about 3 hours in it and I would have read much longer had we not run out of time. I got quite a sunburn sitting outside urlLink Cosi on Connecticut Ave in Dupont Circle on Thursday. It was a gorgeous day and I spent about 4 hours working my way through "The Radical Center." I got the most ridiculous farmer's tan ever. It's fading pretty quickly now. But it's also peeling of course-- on my forehead and stuff. So that's the price I pay.
My friend Rick has sent another letter. He works in London occasionally for a technology company based in Washington, DC. London, April 7 Yesterday I walked up and down Oxford Street, interested to see what it was like with both weather and crowds more tolerable than in the Christmas season. The first thing I noticed was that several stores had gone out of business. I wasn't sure what to make of that. Oxford is always a difficult street to walk on. Maybe it's the polyglot mix of Brits trying to walk on the left, Americans on the right, and knots of Japanese tourists plowing right up the middle, while various others stand still and block the way, oblivious to the humanity swirling around them. Get on the wrong side of the sidewalk at a crucial moment, and you'll be swept past a store you want to visit like flotsam in a flash flood. In this way Oxford Street often chooses your destination for you, and it took me into the John Lewis department store. It's a whole street of big, old-fashioned department stores of several stories each, fairly evenly spaced all the way to Marble Arch. John Lewis is not the most imposing of the bunch. That would be Selfridge's, a massive edifice with the ultimate conceit of having no sign outside, and no need of one. Most of them seem to have adopted the sure-fire floor plan that places cosmetics and jewelry in the front half of the ground floor like an extortionate roadblock to the impressionable shopper. The escalator behind the perfume counters at John Lewis slices down through fragrant clouds to one of my greatest weaknesses-- the kitchen department. From gas hobs to garlic presses, the floor is an irresistible smorgasbord of things you don't need and must have. There were eight high-end brands of cookware, and more cast iron than I would have expected, handsomely enameled on the outside but hefty as a sledgehammer. As I looked over a dizzying selection of pepper mills-- which I don't need because I just bought one. I noticed a young woman with a pad of paper and clipboard, examining the goods and taking notes. A store clerk, I assumed, until I noticed several others doing the same thing across the floor. Then it came to me: these were June brides-to-be, registered at John Lewis and working up their wish lists. The twentysomethings moved methodically among the displays, testing the kitchen scales, lifting the saucepans, opening canisters, and taking notes. If they were taking inventory, as it initially appeared, it was the inventory of their future kitchen cabinets (on display in the next room). They were leaving no trivet unturned. So this is how today's systematic bride (and probably yesterday's too) goes about harvesting the gifts that will soon weigh down a table outside thereception hall. I'm sure there?s nothing uniquely British about this practice. I just never ran into it before. Later I walked down Tottenham Court Road, a slightly grittier thoroughfare where pickpockets and shoplifters ply what almost seems a more honest trade-- or at least an entirely unpretentious one. I found a good paperback after wandering through the stacks at Foyle's, stopped for a quick pizza, and went back to the hotel to read, feeling I had spent the day in an episode of Seinfeld-- that show that's entirely pleasant even though nothing at all ever happens.
This page seems different now since I've taken some steps to integrate it more completely into real life. People have read about Dave and they ask about him. Or they have a question about Gabriel. It's very interesting... The weekend was quite nice. I was in DC for about 24 hours for a conference appearance. Dave and I had planned to take the boy camping but it was so cold this weekend, that we had to make alternate plans. Can you believe a temperature of 20 degrees overnight in upper Michigan? In mid-May? By the way, Michiganians would probably call urlLink Tawas northern lower Michigan. I call it "upper lower." I can't help myself. Anyway... we took Gabe to a hotel and he played in the pool. This is the cool thing about kids. They don't care that much about plans. They want to have a good time. Dave would say that I could use some help from Gabe in the planning department. I'm working on it... but damn, it's hard not to be a Type A. So Gabe had a great time. Life for him these days revolves around urlLink Spiderman . You might not be aware of it, but there's this movie out?? :) It's effect on kids has been hard to underestimate. Gabe is still committed, in principle, to dinosaurs. But Spiderman now enjoys top seed.
I'm sitting in Cosi writing this... in the heart of the Philadelphia's gay district. Or whatever you call it. It's my first visit to the city and I must say it's not bad, although I like Washington better. But I've also been to Washington several times and so I'm probably letting my familiarity with the city cloud my judgment. Still, it's alright. I'm staying at the Marriott downtown, so it was a walk about 6 blocks or maybe less to get here from there. Next door is urlLink Caribou ... so there are some cool places from my past to make me feel comfortable here. I'm only here for a couple days... just a taste of the city. I'm making some work-related appearances. And I'm also here to moderate a urlLink media panel for urlLink Pridefest . That panel is tomorrow night, so I've been using a chunk of the day today thinking about issues to have the panel members discuss. The media coverage of the whole pedophilia thing will be a part of the mix. But my panel includes executives from urlLink MTV and urlLink Showtime , so we'll probably discuss gay and lesbian characters on shows like urlLink The Real World and urlLink Queer As Folk . And we'll also talk about the new gay cable network planned. Geesh, Chris is right: the #30 sandwich at urlLink Cosi is great! Turkey, cranberry, romaine lettuce... mmmmm. I know: how pathetic is this?!? It's 9:30pm on a Wednesday night and in a city with a bunch of great restaurants, I'm sitting in a coffee shop eating a sandwich. Truth be told, I ruined myself today with a late lunch at the hotel. And for room service, it was actually pretty damn good. OK, OK... yes once again in a city with so many good restaurants, I ordered room service at the hotel. I'm so damn lame. :)
Dave is away for a few hours... 5 year old Gabe is seeing Grandma and Grandpa for the evening... the house is clean at last! It's a Saturday night and I have nothing to do and I'm so glad to be saying that. It's been a long time since I wrote here... but suffice it to say it's been an eventful period. Gabe is with us for the summer and that means much of the world revolves around him. I'm not complaining. I love that little boy with all my heart. He's got enough energy to electrify a major city, but he has a beautiful heart. So he and I have great times together. I'm trying very hard to stake out a part of my life that's my own. Part of this is because of work pressures... but I've also been concerned lately that I'm neglecting to deal with things that come up in my life. I've ignored those things by using the convenient excuse that I'm too busy to handle them now. Well, none of these issues are life and death, so to speak. But no matter the issue... sooner or later it's better to face it, and get it out of the way. So I need to create a little bit of space so I can do that this summer. That will be my goal. By the way... Gabe is still firmly committed to the idea of Spiderman.
a nice way to begin the week. I had two breakfasts today, after not feeling quite so hot yesterday. Both were reasonably good for me... but I could still afford to lay off food for the rest of the day. We're having a group of friends over tonight to watch urlLink "Sex and the City" on urlLink HBO . We're new converts to the series... so we're following up the new episodes with a survey of the other 4 seasons of the series. It's great TV and it's almost enough to make us forget how much we miss " urlLink Six Feet Under ." So web friends... I've been thinking a lot lately about two locations... New York City and Minneapolis/Saint Paul. Talk about worlds apart! I'm such the midwestern guy that I've rarely made any trips to the east coast, except for Washington, D.C. I'm there 5-6 times a year. But New York? I went there for a weekend last fall... and it was my first trip there ever. DC is, for me, the quintessentially perfect city. The neighborhoods have their own character and charm. My friend Chris has just moved from far NW down to a cool apartment about half way in between urlLink Adams Morgan and urlLink Dupont Circle . Those neighborhoods are diverse, distinctive, gay (particularly Dupont and these days, Logan Circle) and hip. And, DC isn't so big that one can't be deluded into thinking that he can own a urlLink chunk of the city. I always feel that way when I'm there-- urlLink walking down the streets or urlLink reading till dark at Cosi . Whether or not it's true doesn't matter. It's how you feel. Now... can I feel that way about New York? New York chews up the newcomer and spits him out. It's not pretty... particularly when it's a nice midwestern guy who has little idea about what's going to happen to him. I saw a friend of mine go through this about a year ago. Yeah he was eaten alive by the city. But he lived to tell about it. So why should it be any different for me? If I end up there some day, I'll be overwhelmed and disillusioned and alone and cramped... and then you know what? I'll wake up one day and realize that I've urlLink discovered a urlLink new kind of life for myself in the big city. Webbly Goodness Hair yesterday... hair today... hair tomorrow... to summarize... urlLink HAIRevolution . Another Elmer ClapTrap Public Service Award Winner: urlLink George McClintock travels the world ... protecting democracy... assuring millions that urlLink shortwave radio is still the home of the Gospel... as well as a lot of urlLink racist propaganda .
And a happy 31st to my good friend Matt. He's a sweet man of the first order... and he deserves whatever great rewards come to him today. urlLink Jockohomo ... one of Cleveland's coolest gay men... sends along urlLink this piece by Camille Paglia about the state of gay intellectual thought. It ain't pretty. "There was a time when gay men were known for their scathingly independent minds and their encyclopedic knowledge of culture. The welcome relaxation of legal and social sanctions against homosexuality over the past 30 years has paradoxically weakened the unsentimental powers of observation for which gays, as outsiders, were once renowned. Gay men used to be ferocious exemplars of free thought and free speech. But within 15 years of the 1969 Stonewall rebellion, an insidious totalitarianism infected gay activism, parallel to what was occurring in feminism in the Catharine MacKinnon/Andrea Dworkin era. Intolerance and witch hunts became the norm." Here's what urlLink Andrew Sullivan had to urlLink say about it . Other Notes... urlLink NBC is airing urlLink "The Rerun Show" next month. It's a series devoted to the word-by-word recreation of old TV scripts. The urlLink New York Sun 's David Blum urlLink is not impressed .
And Thank God for that! I'm sitting here this morning... chewing on a urlLink squagel from urlLink Cosi wondering if the House will rent out his urlLink office . Word on the street is that Traficant, a self-styled politician, (read: complete loon), will appeal using urlLink a startling new defense .
Less than a week away from my birthday! Yes, I'm about to celebrate 35 years of continuous service... or maybe it's continuous annoyance. In any case, this Leo is about to have his day. I'm not planning anything big-- in fact, I'm not planning anything at all. Maybe my friends are... who knows? :) I've been making good progress in my effort to read books of my own choosing this summer. I work in a job that requires a lot of reading and I find that I don't have much time for my own reading for pleasure. Or when I do... I find I'm too tired or uninterested in reading to pick up a book. So I've had long weekends of total vegging out. And while that's fun, I feel a little empty after it's all over-- like I should have read more. But this summer has been good. I've made a lot of progress in the past 3 weeks in urlLink Proust ; I'm still reading about urlLink Adams and urlLink Roosevelt , too. So maybe soon, I'll be able to report a finished book. How cool would that be?! :)
Just about the time I really started to miss Dave (a mere 1 day after he left), he called on Friday night to say that he was on his way back for the weekend. It was great to see him on Saturday... and Sunday we went to Chicago together. It was basically to kill 3 birds with one stone: to return Dave to his new home; to move some more of his stuff; and to give me a chance to see where he is and what his surroundings are like. He's in a great place-- a cool apartment about 7 blocks from urlLink Wrigley Field . That alone will keep him happy for months. He's also not far from urlLink BoysTown . That will also keep Dave occupied for some time to come. And he's close to work... but who thinks about work?
Dave is off to Chicago to his new job. The house is much quieter now with everyone gone. I had a short workday, so I've been hanging out around the house... feeling what it's like to inhabit all this space myself. Luckily, the furniture takes up a great deal of the space because it seems very empty. The weekend started today at noon. Now that's what I call great! I'm also planning a longer vacation for later September. I'll take a couple weeks off and hit Chicago and DC to see my boys in both cities. And I'll probably enjoy a few days in Ann Arbor, just being lazy.
Minot, ND takes urlLink quality assurance to a whole new level. And as a part of our continuing series... urlLink Nashville, Tennessee responds to terror .
... still use the word content ? Today at Sweetwaters, two women were talking over lattes and one of them said, "I think we have the right content in place." She also said, "He would need to know content better than anyone." And then, "We should name someone content supervisor." It's funny how, 2 years ago, that word had kind of cool, magical ring to it. You know... back in the days of urlLink Yahoo! FinanceVision or something. Back before the tech bubble burst. Of course, there's still such a thing as content now... but have you noticed how funny it sounds? Sweetwaters used to be the home to a lot of this kind of conversation in Ann Arbor, MI. A friend told me that in 2000, there was about $100 million in venture capital financing circulating throughout the city. Back in those days, you could walk in the cafe and see techie-types in suits talking about first round financing, buyouts, stock options and content . The cafe is a much quieter place these days.
Ah urlLink Cholula ... WAIT! You don't know about the world's most delicious hot sauce? Cholula is todd tested and approved. It has wide appeal. Even urlLink women who look like Garrison Keillor wearing blonde extensions love it. (I'm really reaching for that one, huh?) Ever wanted to say to your colleague in the neighboring cubicle... your kid's art STINKS! You have something in common with urlLink this guy . This is still quite a story... as much as we've heard about it. urlLink USA Today documents what was going on in the skies over American the morning of 9/11. urlLink Part 1 urlLink Part 2 urlLink Gary Jr. is out of urlLink surgery . He broke his wrist in a skateboarding accident. It aint a pretty situation for a guy like Gary, who likes to workout. He'll be wearing an external fixator for about 6-8 weeks... we wish you the best! Oh... and as a part of our continuing occasional series... urlLink Lousiana Responds to Terror .
A long week... with the death of one of my aunts... and the passing of one of the best urlLink radio personalities I ever had the pleasure of knowing. So it has been a relatively emotional time. I'm not highly overt in my expressions of emotion. But after writing and talking about this in several venues Thursday and Friday... it was bound to take its toll. I've got a cold, which I rarely get, I'm tired, and feeling like I'd rather be withdrawn this weekend. Dave and I watched urlLink Pearl Harbor last night and I was deeply affected by the ending-- urlLink Josh Hartnett's character dies trying to save his best friend, played by urlLink Ben Affleck . Well... as much as I like seeing urlLink Josh on the big screen, that movie isn't really a classic. But have you ever had that happen before? Something that wouldn't have made a deep impression on you if it had happened yesterday... feels far more profound today. Dave lightened up the moment by reminding me that when he dies, I should refer to him at least once in the eulogy as a urlLink bastard . It's one of his favorite words. Dave is likely to move to urlLink Chicago in a couple weeks. It's time for the Big D to get a job and he found a good one in the urlLink Windy City . This is going to mean a lot of trips to Chicago for the toddo. No complaints on that account. But as I consider the possibility of 2 trips a month, I'm trying to find some cheap and reliable alternatives. I'm planning to get a urlLink CR-V in a couple months, so I could always take that. But big cities are best enjoyed without having to deal with a car. So I might take advantage of the cheap urlLink Southwest flights or if I don't mind arriving hours late, I could always take urlLink the train . The train is a crock, by the way. Don't get me wrong... I love the idea. Train service in the urlLink Northeast corridor is excellent-- particularly when the urlLink fast trains are urlLink actually running . But everywhere else, urlLink delays rule. The last time Dave took the train from urlLink Chicago to Ann Arbor , he left on time and arrived an hour and 40 minutes late. Now, it's only a 4 hour trip. How can you be that far off in that short stretch? Well, it's cheap ( urlLink subsidized ) and so I'll take it when I don't need to be worried about time. I'll probably be taking the little one out to Chicago once a month... and I know he'll like it!
Nothing that special to say about this day... and to my knowledge, no consulting company has adopted it as their name yet. My weekend has been good. A group of friends came over last night to play urlLink Hoopla . It's the newest game from urlLink Cranium . The concept is similar... the best parts of familiar games thrown together in a new combination. But this game moves faster and you can play with as few as 2 players. We had a great time. Hoopla will be available this fall at urlLink Starbucks . Friday night, I spent a few hours sitting outdoors at the urlLink bar . My friend Bob showed up after a while so I put the book down and chatted, people-watched... and just generally enjoyed the cool evening. So... yes, it's been a quiet weekend! Dave returns tonight... and I'll be happy to see him again after a few days away. And the little one comes back to the house tomorrow. More Web Goodness urlLink Andrew Sullivan's web log features a great urlLink letter about the integration of gay and straight and how it can sometimes be so seamless. I think this is pretty rare. But as members of the LGBT community, we hole up in the ghetto too often and miss out on opportunities to really connect with others who aren't like us. It's not easy and sometimes it doesn't work. But when it does, it's truly enriching. The Mighty (Boring) Garrison Keillor appears to have reached a urlLink new contract agreement with urlLink Minnesota Public Radio . Part of the deal calls for a GK HQ outside MPR's palatial digs at 45 E 7th St in St. Paul. If I were them, I'd want to move him somewhere else, too. While I'm on the subject of MPR... check out urlLink this piece about MPR's new dominance in LA. Wireless Fans: urlLink Cringely takes us up above the treetops to check out the forest. A vast urlLink new world of wireless is just around the corner. Last month... my friend Nathan Bierma urlLink blogged for 24 hours straight. He participated in urlLink Blogathon 2002 ... the annual event to raise money for charity. He urlLink wrote about his experience for the urlLink Chicago Tribune . I don't quite know what to make of urlLink this . Any thoughts? How did I come across it? I was looking for details of Martha Stewart's early modeling career. Go figure.
urlLink The Register notes the reaction to urlLink PwC Consulting's name change. They're now known as Monday: . The parody sites are just revving up. urlLink Here's one , for starters. And here's another... taking advantage of a big mistake: PwC registered introducingmonday.com ... but forgot to register the .co.uk version. urlLink Someone else didn't . By the way... Deloitte Consulting-- not to be outdone-- is urlLink considering a rebranding of its own. May we suggest Tuesday:? Good luck registering that name...
So now I'm 35! Last year, when I turned 34, I rhapsodized about it. And as I urlLink read that post again , I see no reason to 1) say anything more this year, or 2) to go on about it any longer. I still feel at the top of my game... and I pity all those little 22 year old gay boys who think life ends at 30. While I'm thinking of it, I also pity those 35 year old gay guys who think life ended at 30. Dave has been in Chicago for a few days; I'll pick him up at the train station today. It's hard to be away from him because I'm always thinking of things to tell him and he's not around for me to tell him! I'm such a dork. So Thursday we spent 30 minutes on the phone in 3 sessions... discussing Chicago, work back here... everything else. Friday, we managed to keep it down to 5 minutes. Honestly, there have been times where I kept a list in my Palm of things to tell him. It's really quite pathetic. But at the same time, it's so cool to have someone that you can be that way with. Plus, we both know that this will be a momentous year for us, so we're making the most of it. It's Webalicious... During this time in which we're all under the urlLink elevated risk of terrorist attack, it's good to know that South Dakota is uniquely positioned (immediately to the south of North Dakota) to urlLink respond to terror . Is Bluetooth finally going to take off? Here's the story from urlLink InfoWorld . Here's some urlLink analysis . You've wondered... asked... awakened, screaming in the night... when was the first Internet mention of the Y2K bug? for the moment, it looks to be urlLink 1985 . Don't you just love urlLink Google ? urlLink The Economist has a urlLink fun piece related to that idiotic urlLink class action lawsuit filed against several fast food companies .
Writing you all from Chicago... I thought I should say something since it's been several days since I wrote anything here. I had a great weekend seeing friends in Iowa... and even one of my brothers. D and I went back for the weekend so I could do some TV work. The Big D is moving home tomorrow, which makes me very happy. It's been an interesting journey for both of us over the last 7 weeks. But all's well that ends well. Of course, is it really over? Well, that's the thing about love and life... it never is. D and I have been spending a lot of time talking with each other about worked the last time around... and of course, what didn't. More things worked than didn't. But the things that didn't were enough to sink the relationship. So now as we start over again, we need to try as much as we can to avoid the mistakes we made before. You know what? It takes a lot of thinking to do that. I think any of us can rattle off a list of things that didn't work about a relationship. But what about the next step? Can we take that list... turn it around... and develop a game plan to implement in the next relationship? This is literally what D and I are doing. D is a sports guy and so we're borrowing that analogy to develop strategies... to preserve the relationship and other strategies to make sure that we avoid the pitfalls we fell into before... as best we can. It's strategy... planning.. flying by the seat of your pants... screwing up... turning around mid play and running the other way. It's about love .
Believe me, I'm the last guy to do something like that. I'm all about scheduling and planning, PDA's and Outlook and tasks and color-coded appointments. But last night, I was faced with a dilemma. I had a flight leaving for Cincinnati this morning at 9am. I have a conference there through Saturday. But last night at 8:15pm, I decided I needed to go to Chicago and see the man I love. What I did next was so unlike me. I called D at work and told him I'd meet him at midnight. What about the conference and your flight tomorrow , he asked. I'll work that out , I said. Tonight, I want to come to see you . And so I f*cked the itinerary and drove to Chicago and spent the night walking around Lincoln Park with D , talking about our lives, our love for each other, our passion for the same things, our differences, the reasons why we've failed twice to make this work, and the reason why we're going to do it again. We stopped at an all-night diner and ate a blueberry sundae. We talked about city life and growing up and the future. And then we went to sleep about 5am. The reason I tell this story is the same reason I'll probably remember that night for the rest of my life. It was the first night I truly understood that someone was more important than my work schedule... was more important than my plans. I exist inside a prison of plans... and plans are good things. But just like rules, plans are made to be broken. And we learn so much if we recognize those moments when we need to break them. I learned some really wonderful things about the most important person in my life because instead of setting aside a thought, I decided to act upon it. And lest I feel too good about it, I need to remember all the other times in my life when words remained unspoken and actions remained undone. Life is too short for this. Speak. Act. Live . We had a small going away party when D left for Chicago 3 weeks ago. I'll be having a more personal celebration when this man who loves me so much moves back to be with me in 3 weeks. PS -- I am in Cincy tonight... drove back from Chicago this afternoon, packed, and caught a flight to CVG at 9pm. There will always be a seat on an airplane. There won't always be a night like the one I had last night. I read urlLink this today... and I will do my best to live it.
A quiet weekend... waking early to do laundry and clean the house... and then go right back to bed. Now what was the sense of that? It can't be helped. I suffer from the weird assumption that if I get up after 8am on a Saturday, then I'm a lazy bum. Well, by that measure, I've been quite lazy lately. But this morning, I was up at 6:45am and promptly back in bed at 10am. D arrived from Chicago at 1pm and he joined me within minutes of walking through the door. We slept till 6:30pm... the blissful sleep one experiences with the man he loves lying next to him. D has his 10th high school reunion tonight... and then I'll drive him back to Chicago tomorrow. This may be how our lives will be for a while. I'd like D to move back. But I won't ask him to turn away so quickly from the opportunities that Chicago offers. If you've had a long distance relationship before, you know better than I do the impact it has. I have a friend who lives in San Francisco and who's partner lives in Connecticut. For the last 5 years, they've seen each other on weekends and for longer periods when they can. They've managed to maintain a tight, monogamous relationship. That's one example of some I'm aware of. I'm more uncertain about it. A lot of questions go through my mind. The biggest ones are these: how does a relationship grow when you see each other only on Saturday and Sunday? What about Monday through Friday? D needs to make some decisions in the next few days, so we'll have a lot to talk about tomorrow on the way to Chicago. But tonight, at least, there's the comfort of his arms.
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. One... two... three... oops. One... I'm going to spend 4-- yes, four -- unforgettable days in Cincy next week. Of course, why am I being a snob? I come from Iowa, right? Anybody have any recommendations? I'm definitely gonna hit urlLink Skyline Chili for 5 Way Chili. I'll be in the Hilton downtown, so I'll probably limit my daily travel to downtown, with a few exceptions. hmmm... does Cincinnati have any hot boys? :)
... how this morning is almost a perfect carbon copy of the morning we woke up to a year ago? A clear, blue sky... a beautiful sunny morning. Such is the case in New York and Washington... and such is also the case in Ann Arbor, MI. I stand on the roof of one of the buildings on the Michigan campus and I can see over the horizon to one year ago. Dave and I had had a long discussion the night before about the bombing of the World Trade Center. We'd used Google to look up articles on the rebuilding after the bombing. We had discussed how the bombing was more damaging to the structure of the towers than first realized. We speculated about what might have happened if they had collapsed. The next morning I got up and went for an early workout. I parked the car at 8:55am and walked home. I got home at 9:10am... and that's how my unforgettable day began. Looking outside this morning, I was tempted to think it was September 11, 2001 all over again. How many millions of Americans have thought how many millions of times about getting the chance to relive that day. Maybe it's just to get the chance to be somewhere else... or to get the chance to relocate friends and relatives who were victims-- to move them out of the line of fire. How many times have you thought over the past year... if only I could undo what's happened ? Or course, we can't. We have to look back, mourn and move on. As urlLink trcnyc says urlLink today ... Honor the past... Embrace the future .
to fight for someone? You hear it in the movies sometimes or in a romance novel. But what does it really mean? I don't have a good answer. What would you fight for? Your life? Freedom? Your boyfriend? A great piece of cheesecake? hmmm... all are worthy in their own way. The guy who was my boyfriend wants to try one more time. We never gave it a fair chance , he says. We were both selfish. I want you to fight for me , he says. I sent him away to Chicago... am I ready to ask him back? I had a talk tonight with a perceptive and thoughtful guy... we talked about how we discover what it is we need out of a relationship. We enter a relationship in a flexible state and that's how the best relationships work. But if you think about it carefully, there are certain things we won't negotiate away. It might be monogamy. It might be a night out alone once a month. It might be time with friends. It might be the music you like but your boyfriend hates. It might be the need to go to bed at the same time so that you have time for sex or to talk about the day. Or maybe you think that your boyfriend should shoulder his half of the economic burden. Whatever they might be, chances are you have some non-negotiables. If you give them away in the process of developing a relationship, chances are they'll come back to bite you on the ass at some point. It's worth taking some time to figure out what those are for you. I had a couple friends tell me this summer that I should make a list. Well, I didn't actually make a list, but I've thought through some of them. And now that The Guy really does want to grab my hand and lead me to something new and spontaneous, maybe it's time to begin a serious discussion about those. - - - Mark... thanks for the pics of DC you sent me. I love that city. I haven't been there since May... but I'll be in the city for a week in early October... doing precisely nothing except for seeing my ex and some other friends and urlLink reading and going to the urlLink gym .
Lying in bed Saturday night with The Guy . Holding him close. Whispering my heart to him as he whispers his back to me. Smelling his skin... tasting his breath. You think to yourself if my heart stops now, my dying expression will be a smile . I hear my heart in those moments... how can I not? It's so full of warmth and feeling. But he reminded me of something about myself that I don't like much at all. I said if you could change one thing about me what would it be? He said for once I want to grab your hand and lead you into a new and spontaneous moment... and not have you think of 3 reasons why it won't work .
... I love about not having a roommate? Not having a roommate. You know what sucks about not having a roommate? Yeah... you got it. I've had one for 15 months and loved it. We had a great time together... watched TV, stayed up way too late talking, occasionally got in each other's way, never argued, sometimes got peeved at each other, sometimes did illegal things together... in essence, created we created a full catalog of experiences as roommates. And I miss that. But... I also like coming home at the end of a long day of work and a tough workout at the gym and finding the loft in the same condition in which I left it. My room can be a mess... and it is. But I like the living room and kitchen to be spotless-- especially the kitchen. Such is now the case. I like silence. When I live alone, the loft becomes a refuge from friendly fans who come up to me at Sweetwaters and ask for an autograph, or from people looking and mouthing the words [my name] to the person with them. Don't get me wrong. I like the attention. It's fun and flattering. I talked to an expert on shyness a few weeks ago who said that performers, comedians, actors and such are often "shy extroverts." They love commanding an audience, but off their stage, they tend to be somewhat withdrawn and shy. Maybe that's me. Or maybe I'm a fine balance of introvert/extrovert. People often think introverts are afraid of crowds and social situations. So introvert becomes a sort of perjorative term. But introverts can derive a great deal of enjoyment from big groups and social settings. The key is that they also enjoy being alone. I go back and forth. You know... I started with the roommate and wandered off... but there's a connection to tie it all together... which those of you who read my weblog and essays know I love to do. Actually, you know what? I'm not going to tie it together. You can do it. I don't need to lead you, like a group of preschool kids holding onto a rope for the walk to the museum. I've been thinking about my approach to writing here. For nearly 6 years, everything I've written-- particularly the essays-- has been fashioned around the idea of creating little moral lessons. I describe it in shorthand as "all's well that ends well." I regularly re-work events as I tell them so that they wrap up nicely and neatly in little moral lessons. But life is rarely like that. And more often lately, I've been thinking about allowing more reality and uncertainty to drift onto these pages. I don't believe in revealing everything. I was IMing urlLink Chrisonomicon yesterday and he said he never talked much about guys he dates on urlLink his journal because if they don't work out, he might feel somewhat foolish-- my paraphrase. This is one example of something I've chosen to reveal in measured amounts. You don't want to hear it all anyway, right? Of course, not. But it would be more honest and -- to use the word my friend Matt hates-- interesting -- to acknowledge the complexity of life more readily... rather than trying to fashion a small drama that neatly wraps itself up in 42 minutes. Or 500 words. We can still leave the other 18 minutes for that hot Bowflex guy with the dark hair and the perfect abs... I'm just saying...
... continues. I don't feel like being around most of my friends for a while. I need the time to recuperate and eventually I'll join up with everyone again. And actually, the time at home has done me good. I've met some really cool guys online around the country and had some good conversations on the Internet and on the phone. I've read quite a bit. I've watched more TV than i have in a long time... which means upwards of an hour a day... and I've wasted a lot of time. We don't waste enough of it. Time, that is. We schedule ourselves to the point where there isn't a minute to spare... and then when we respond to the natural urge to clear out a little personal space for reflection or downtime, we feel like we've wasted the time or have been lazy. I think it is a natural urge to be a little lazy sometimes, and I think it's a good thing if you listen to that voice.
Hope you had a good one! Mine was a mix of quiet and some friend-type activities. I spent Saturday night and Sunday in Chicago. I took the 6 yo out to see his dad, who really misses him. it was nice to spend time with both of them. Today has been a long day of sleeping generally and doing nothing, in particular. :) I love it! Summer is over... and what a summer it's been. I don't know why it is but summers are always so hard for me. I get the least amount of sleep, work the hardest, have the least vacation time, and have some of the worst things happen along the way. I can think back to last summer... what a hothouse of emotions and possibilities that was with Dave. There was 1997... and one or two attempts with a wonderful guy named Curt. The one really big exception was the summer of 2000 with Chris. That was a really cool relationship that didn't go as far as I wanted it to... but maybe I only have myself to blame because I ended it. He's in Washington now and I still see him as much as I can. This summer has been another hothouse with Dave. But the one good thing-- of many-- that can be said is that he and I are closer than we've ever been, despite kind of a wild ride. I'm a type A kind of guy so I prefer to know the answers and have the closure. But I've learned that in love-- and in this situation, in particular-- that's just not going to happen. Dave and I will be reassessing and asking each other questions and probing and talking for a long time to come. As friends, we'll probably do this for a lifetime. We might find ourselves doing it again as lovers, too. You just never know. And that's the key. You never know . Web-arriffic Frank Rich wrote an urlLink exceptional piece about the media coverage of the 1 year anniversary of 9/11. It's from the NY Times. Check it out!
think I'm beginning to figure out what's wrong... I'm not getting the time I need to write as much as I would like to. This hasn't been very easy for me to figure out. But it finally made sense when I noticed that every time I've been restless, I've reached for my laptop to write email, or to update this journal... or some other writing-related activity. So maybe this is it. I need to give my self some extra time as much as possible to write more. Not that I always have something interesting or thoughtful to write. Sometimes it's banal stuff. But I wrote a urlLink cool friend of mine tonight that I think there's something to be said for writing as much as possible... even when it isn't perfect. I think the more you write... the better you get. Write.. write... write... and the more you write the better you get to be with this most important of crafts. Speaking of friends... Chrisonomicon is one of thousands of writers getting ready to take part in the urlLink National Novel Writing Month . He and others will be trying to write 50,000 words during the month of November. It's a lofty goal... and well worth it, I think. My other friend named Chris-- this is the one in DC-- has returned to his weblog after a long absence. It's about time!!! :) Ok... I'll lay off. I've taken long, unexplained vacations from my journal, too. But it's nice to have you back! But I digress... So yeah.. I need to set aside enough time to write a little every day... something like 750-1000 words. It's not a novel, but it doesn't have to be... just enough each day to empty some of the thoughts out of my head. Now if I can get to all that email I'm accumulating!
Something's wrong. It's as simple as that... wrong. Plain wrong . Don't ask me what it is. I don't know. Life is good. I'm healthy. My boyfriend is healthy and his eyes shine with love for me when they turn in my direction. Work is good. hmmm... is it the weather? Oh my god... what is my horoscope saying these days?! What if all that astrology stuff is actually true??? And what about voodoo? Maybe someone has a doll of me... hmmm... maybe I need more sex.
... will I ever find the time to answer all the email I need to answer? Will I ever get to reconnect with the cool people I miss talking to? I need more time... where is it going? I must be wasting it... or using it in a different way... or both. How frustrating...
It's been a great weekend for seeing family and friends... staying up late... watching bad movies... sleeping in with the boyfriend... and watching a lot of sports. I'm not even going to mention the urlLink Michigan-Iowa game . It's just too embarassing. But there were better times. Friday night, D and I went to the Michigan/Alaska-Fairbanks Hockey game. We had the most perfect seats... Row 3, center line. I spent the whole game with my face up against the glass. And it was a good game, too. urlLink Michigan finished them off... 5-2 . Dave was less than pleased with urlLink Game 6 of the World Series. I don't mind seeing it go on to Game 7... since it gives the come-from-behind Angels another chance. Not that I'm an Angels fan, but I like their persistence... and urlLink David Eckstein is handsome! Speaking of sports... check out the urlLink NY Times article about Esera Tuaolo and his process of coming out. It reminds me of some of the stories I've been reading in Dan Woog's new book " urlLink Jocks 2 ." By the way, you can read my boyfriend's story in the chapter "Basketball Coach." Yes, this is the second time I've mentioned this... so sue me. :)
I've discovered that since my boyfriend and I got back together, we've been the subject of conversation among a few members of the chattering class. Everybody talks about everybody. I would guess that if you eliminated all gossip and speculation about people from conversation, we'd all be talking about the weather and "them Cubs." Since we got back together, we've been spending extra time focusing on ourselves as a couple. A part of that focus is a renewed introspection. We've also been reading the press clippings, so to speak. There's a certain danger to this... and I'll speak more about that in a few minutes. But, we started putting out a feelers after we got wind of "word on the street" about us. D and I have a certain notoriety where we live... as individuals and as a couple. His return from Chicago and our renewed relationship have provoked some discussion and speculation... not all of it flattering. He's come back because he couldn't make it in Chicago . Todd keeps him as a trophy because he's young and good looking . D's 15 minutes of fame are over and he's latching on to Todd (the "star") to stay in the limelight as long he can . We've listened to a few of those whispers... third hand, of course. We've laughed about them, worried about them, sought advice about them from people we trust. And now I think we need to set them aside. I'm one of those guys who finds this stuff annoying, yes... and sometimes disturbing. But mainly, it gives me a window into how I'm perceived and how people form ideas and beliefs about me. Sometimes the rumor hits home and it reveals a soft spot in my armor... an insecurity that I need to work on, for instance. D and I can approach these whispers intellectually, but like anyone else we also respond viscerally-- D especially. He's a fighter and he has a clear sense of right and wrong. When people talk us down, it's not enough to say fuck 'em and move on. He wants the perpetrator to face the wrong and repent. He and I chuckle about this, and it's one of the traits I truly appreciate about him. But we both know that fighting phantoms is a waste of time. Sadly, the gay community is home to a lot of hurting, insecure people. Gossip and rumors and malicious conversation is the ladder some of them use to try to raise themselves out of the pit of their existence. I think we've all seen this and can understand it. Knowing this neutralizes the gossip and what's plainly not true should disappear without a trace over time. But rumors and gossip, even when untrue, can plant seeds of doubt and mistrust. I don't think my boyfriend believes the crap he hears about me but I know he struggles with it. I hear stuff about him that's plainly ridiculous and then sometimes I wonder. I'm discovering that the stuff that sticks and corrodes our sense of wellbeing is stuff we're already worrying about. It might be on a subconscious level... but the idle chatter brings it to the surface. You can argue that maybe it should come to the surface so we can verbalize it and deal with it. Alright... that might be true. But I think when we dwell on malicious gossip, it hurts more than it helps. So what do we do? None of us will ever escape gossip. A few weeks ago, I wrote that my boyfriend and I were developing a gameplan for our relationship. A big part of this gameplan is being more careful of how we speak about each other. All couples have problems and all guys talk to their friends about their lovers. We're still speaking candidly about our relationship to close friends, but we've tightened that inner circle to a core of caring, analytical men and women who will give us encouragement when we need it and have the courage to correct us when they think we're wrong. We're spending more time talking to each other about what's on our minds, rather than others. We're concentrating as much as we can on our priorities-- projects, friends, each other. And we're letting time make clear to others what it is that exists between us.
... are falling from the trees... the days are cloudy... the nights crisp and silent... I love Autumn. It remains my favorite time of year. There's the romantic angle... whether it's laying in bed on a rainy Saturday morning, holding your lover... or walking through the park on a bright, cool afternoon. The odor of decay rides on the fall breeze... and maybe it's that reminder of death that spurs me to life. I feel more vital in the fall than any other season. And I clean a lot more. What's with that, anyway? I've never known why my messy bedroom or closet-- which has escaped my attention all through the year-- suddenly becomes a priority clean-up issue in September and October. Over the years, I've learned to use this time well. When I'm in the mood, I can throw away great quantities of stuff I don't need anymore. When the spirit hits me, I ride with it and clear the shelves of clothes I no longer wear, books I won't read, sometimes even furniture. It's not one of those frenzies where I wake up the next morning, as if from a drunken dream, thinking to myself "what have I done?!" It's a more a controlled raid on clutter. This year, it's more important because D and I are making the first real move to integrate our living situation. We've been roommates for about 18 months. But as a couple, we're finding the effort to create one bedroom is requiring some major changes. And let me say what a blessing it is to have someone in your life who challenges the status quo. I was reminded of this a couple days after we returned from vacation. I went right to work but D stayed home a few days and began moving things around. I came home from work on Monday and discovered he had cleaned off my desk. The 6,150 lbs of books, papers, yellow credit card slips, business cards, trinkets, pens and unused ethernet cords that sat on my desk was now on our bed. Good move on his part. That gave me until nightfall to deal with the pile. The first evening, my solution was to move the pile to the floor. D was not so pleased... but he was patient. I stalled for another couple days before tackling the desk debris. Most of it went directly to the garbage. D waited a day and then resumed his campaign. We've been trying to make more room for the books that threaten to overwhelm us. D suggested in passing that I should box up my Wired magazines because I'm obviously not reading the old ones, and they're taking up a lot of shelf space. A year ago, this would have been blasphemy. Even now, I winced. My collection dates back to 1995. It's.... um, well ok... it serves no real purpose now and yet for some reason I still save each issue of Wired. Does it matter if they live in a box? No... not at all. I smiled and agreed. What's annoying is that D isn't a packrat like me, so there's no reciprocity. It doesn't seem fair that he can order me to throw away stuff or box things up... when I can't do that to him. Somehow, he manages to live without the clutter that I attract like a magnet. At least he has until now. With a boyfriend like me, he'll soon be a clutter reduction expert.
The rain falls gently outside... the chill night air flows through the open window, at my invitation. I lie awake in my otherwise empty bed... the thoughts turning over in my mind. A friend whose writing hits particularly close to home gave me urlLink something profound to think about this week. Five weeks ago tonight, D came up to my bed and we began the conversation that led to a new beginning. One of the first things I said to him as we laid there... my nose against his neck... was that I'd never given him the benefit of the doubt... never once a chance to prove himself. I took nothing he said at face value. I analyzed everything for the hidden meaning, the real truth... ultimately, the thinly veiled rejection. My skepticism was the outgrowth of my dishonesty about my own feelings-- my own unwillingness to express myself openly and truthfully... to say what I really meant. Why should I assume that everyone else labors under the burden of subterfuge, too? Like Chrisonomicon, I wonder where that essentially dishonesty comes from. I think back to childhood and the rules about being quiet, not disagreeing with others, the prohibitions against questioning parents, God, the church. In a world where dissent must be hidden, disturbing habits develop. One becomes indirect. The stated feeling or emotion is rarely entirely true; silence hides the real thought. How deceptive and damaging this must be. Can I overcome this trait of dishonesty? I must... because as I've said before, it's at the core of the trouble that D and I have had. I have to for my own sake, too, because I'm weary of always looking for the hidden, real , meaning. When I do overcome it-- however briefly-- I get a glimpse of what I'm missing: the unadulterated pleasure of loving someone else. It's a parallel universe where I take people at their word. Last night, my lover's lips made me laugh out loud around the campfire; later, in the darkness of the tent, his lips grazed across my skin and I moaned. I woke up in the middle of the night and felt his arm around me... holding me close. Today, he slept in the car as I drove home... his hand on my leg... and I remembered how often I had seen his eyes flash brilliance in my direction-- a shared joke, silent agreement, longing. Tonight, he called from his parents' to tell me he loved me and to wish me a good night. In the parallel universe, I don't question those moments. I thank whatever God there is that I'm blessed to have such an amazing and special man in my life. Now, why should that be the parallel universe?
We were sitting outdoors on a warm, quiet evening, D and I. Our friend K was chatting with us. Suddenly, D jumped up and walked away without a word. My attention divided between D and K ... I saw D amble over to a young handsome guy, sitting on a stone wall. D leaned up against the wall, looked the guy up and down and said what's up. I looked back at K ... who was telling a funny story. But I couldn't hear what he was saying. I woke up in a cold sweat. Some psychologists says dreams are how our mind handles issues that aren't resolved when we're awake. This may be true. I've been thinking a lot about trust over the past few days... and writing about it. So maybe it wasn't a big surprise that-- with it on the mind, and being separated from him for several days-- that my dreams should pick up this theme. The first thing I thought as I was trying to calm down afterward was how deep this issue goes to our core and how difficult it will be to work on and declare victory over. This is one area where I've thought D didn't offer much help, in the past. In recent weeks, I've come to have a different view on this. But more about that another time. One of the things about dating someone again after having broken up with them before (perhaps twice) is that you remember things. A fresh start is possible but very hard to achieve unless you put everything on the table. There are two incidents that have had the greatest impact on my thinking, as far as my own personal situation is concerned. D has always been somewhat wayward. When we went to Disney World for Gay Days in late May, my guard was up. The first day we were there, D put into practice a little crusing routine. He would walk with me and our friend, but whenever a good looking guy approached, he slowed his pace and fell behind us so that he could give that guy all his attention. At first, I thought it was pretty funny because it was so obvious. But in the end, it was immensely demeaning. I was his boyfriend, but I felt like I was nobody at all. It was a private humiliation, but it was humiliation nonetheless. There is one other incident that's seared in my memory. On my birthday, this year, D was going to be out of town. But he missed his train at the last minute and re-booked for the next day. He called and told me he'd come to my birthday dinner after he was done doing something else. But he didn't. He went out with someone else instead and came home afterward. Even as I write about these incidents, I'm amazed at how petty they are in the grand scheme of things. But they also have tremendous force. I know where D 's mind was at Disney World. He was getting ready to break up with me and so I see what happened as a foreshadowing. I can't let go of the birthday thing. It burns inside of me. I don't feel any anger over it; what I feel is betrayal. I don't think of this every day. The dream brought it back to me this morning. Whenever it comes to mind, I mull it over and try to figure out what it is that I need to do to make it better. The problem is... I don't know. I don't think I want an apology. I don't live my life with a sense of entitlement. I'm not even sure I want an acknowledgement. Emotions defy logic and rationality so maybe I'll never know what I want. But that bothers me more because I think it might lead to a bigger, more divisive issue down the road. Have you ever experienced a situation like this? If so, how have you handled it? I've often been accused of already knowing the answers to the questions I pose in this journal. But whatever the case, I don't know exactly what to do about this one. I do think it's important to think about this because the fact that I harbor these feelings says more about me than the incidents themselves might say about D . I appreciate any ideas you might have. Write me or IM me. If I'm front of the computer and have some time to talk, we'll chat. I should add that as we re-kindle our relationship we've put more issues on the table than ever. We've had some great moments rediscovering each other and discovering new things about each other. I'm trying to decide if I should put this issue on the table, too.
Here in Washington, enjoying my books, my deep thoughts, the satisfaction of reading the paper every day, the pleasures of old and new friends... sometimes my eyes glaze over. I'm searching for the eyes, the arms, the scent of my boyfriend. I'm away for a week from the man I've just been reunited with. I brought him back home Tuesday from Chicago... his address for 6 weeks. And then I left Wednesday for DC. I won't be back until Tuesday. I miss him a lot and he misses me. But the time away can be a clarifying experience. We discovered this when D moved to Chicago. That move happened for a lot of reasons. But one of my motives for wanting him to leave was that a time away from each other would make more clear our feelings for each other. What I thought might take a year took about 17 days. And now he's back and I marvel at how such a tiny speck of time could truly remake his outlook-- and mine. So ok... enough of the love ... let's get down to brass tacks and have a conversation about trust . I don't know why I have such a lack of trust in others. It might be that I've always been independent. Chicken and egg, perhaps. Whatever the case, my trust is in myself first and less so in others. This isn't a big deal-- even with close friends-- because the relationship isn't close enough for it to make a difference. But when you have a boyfriend, it's another kettle of fish. You have to trust him... or develop that trust. Now, there's trust-- as in, I trust my boyfriend not to cheat on me. But there's another kind of trust and I think it's more important and more difficult. It's the trust that your boyfriend loves you, thinks about you and will be there for you. This second kind of trust is the kind of trust that I have the most trouble with. And it's the lack of this kind of trust that was my contribution to our relationship and it's ultimate demise. . Trust is trust... but I'm making this distinction because I think many guys find it possible to trust their boyfriends in one way but not both. I never gave my boyfriend this second kind of trust. I was never certain that he'd stick by me. There were plenty of times when he sent the wrong signals... when he wavered... when he wasn't sure. It's always a two-way street. But I never ever gave him a chance to prove himself to me because deep inside, I didn't think he'd go the distance for me. I never trusted that he loved me when he said he did... or I always questioned just what he meant by love. You can call this over analysis but I call it not giving him a chance. It's more surprising that I felt this way when you remember that this is my best friend. Our deep friendship developed before the romantic relationship and continued beyond it. So how's that for problematic? Yes, but common, I think. So as we rekindle the romantic relationship that we believe was meant to be, we have to start from a different foundation this time. I have to learn to trust. And as difficult as this might be for me, ultimately, this will be one of the elements that will insure our success. How does one develop trust in someone else? That someone else has to help out. But beyond the incidents of trust-building and the moments of intimacy and candor that will build confidence... trust is an act of will. So is love, in my opinion, once the sparkle of a new relationship wears off. One of my greatest contributions to the relationship I'm building with the man I love will be an attitude adjustment. Wish me luck.
I'll always love this city. It's just too cool. Maybe not to live in... I don't know. But I've always found that for sheer relaxation value, it's hard to beat. I've been doing one of about 4 things over the past few days... reading, working out, sleeping, seeing my friend Chris and his friends. My triceps ache... my urlLink abs are tighter... all good signs of how much better my workouts are when i can concentrate on them more without distractions like work. Ah, but is work really a distraction? I've written a lot about the relationship so I'm going to leave that alone for a while. I've been thinking a lot lately about concepts like trust and understanding and self-confidence . My own situation has prompted those thoughts... but also the situations of a few friends of mine. I'll probably write some about these things. A friend of mine wrote some of his thoughts about urlLink monogamy and I'm planning to add a few of my own, too. This could be a shameless plug: Dan Woog's latest book, urlLink Jocks 2 , is out. It features the stories of gay athletes and the struggles that they have faced in coming out and living as members of the LGBT community. I can't say it's great because I haven't received my copy yet. But Dan Woog's work is typically quite good. And I think we can expect the same from this new book. In the interests of full disclosure, I should mention that Woog has written a chapter about urlLink my boyfriend and how he was forced to quit his job as a school official and basketball coach because he came out. The urlLink guy on the cover is hot. He is not my boyfriend... but I think my guy is cuter and, yes... hotter.
Thank goodness, we made it home without a big bag of leftovers. I love turkey and all the fixin's... but for the sake of my carefully controlled diet, it's best to limit the high-level calorie intake to one day, if at all possible. And it was a calorie fest yesterday. Dave's family is large and growing... and there was enough turkey, stuffing, potatoes, yams, and green bean casserole to feed an army. Yes, I said Green Bean Casserole. Yesterday, I predicted that this dish wouldn't make an appearance at the family event. I was wrong. We watched the Lions lose. Now this is something we could do on any given Sunday. I wasn't sure why it was necessary to set aside time on a holiday for it. But it's traditional. I mean it's traditional to watch the game... not that it's traditional for the Lions to lose. Well... hmmm... maybe it is. I ate the equivalent of a small house. How could I not?? I was telling Dave afterward that I love Thanksgiving for the food, even though the food isn't what most of us would call remarkable or innovative. In fact, it's the sameness of the food that is the draw... because it's the memory that's important when it comes to Thanksgiving. In many families, Christmas dinner is more innovative.. often drawing on ethnic traditions. In my family, there was no ethnic tradition. Christmas dinner was a repeat of Thanksgiving. Not that I'm complaining, necessarily. Dave made apple pie as his contribution to the family feast. He made it from scratch. No pre-made crust... no! It was Dave's creation... with some coaching from his best friend Laura. And it was good. The crust was flaky and perfect. "It's all in the Crisco," said Dave. Hmmm... had I heard that somewhere before? Our favorite party store had 15% off on wine yesterday... just in time for a little party Dave and I are giving tonight. I wish you could see this party store. It's general dilapidated condition reminds you of most party stores. But the owner is this guy who loves wine. He has a top quality collection and a wine club to boot. So we dropped about $100 on a few bottles last night. So... we've invited close to 60 people to this party tonight. But unlike our last party, where we invited 40 and got 60, we're expecting 25 at best tonight. Most people are away for the holidays. But that's alright with us. It's more just a low-key gathering for friends in the area who have... well... seen all of the family that they can stand to see. Know what I mean? Which makes me think... too bad all of us journalers and bloggers live so far apart. It would be so much fun to invite Chrisonomicon, Jockohomo, Jonno, Neohomo, Gary Jr., trcnyc and so many others. I'd mention Spin, except I will be seeing him today. He's seeing family in Toledo, so I'll be taking Dave's son down there today for a visit. Speaking of visits... I have a feeling there will be some more dispatches from Rick this weekend. I'll post them here as I get them.
A busy week stops short on Wednesday... and how nice it felt to take a long nap yesterday afternoon! Today, life gets more busy as Dave and I drive north to his family's holiday gathering. I'm already thinking about the food. But I might need something early... like one of those solid breakfasts of eggs and potatoes that I can eat just about any time of the day. What's open today? Geesh... probably nothing but McDonalds and Burger King, with their fake sausage and trans-fatty biscuits. Oh well... hope springs eternal. I've had several emails asking if our family gathering will include Green Bean Casserole. I've not checked with Dave to be certain, but something tells me that a Mexican family with a tradition of well-produced and authentic foods won't be eating Green Bean Casserole. I might be surprised. This will be my first Mexican Thanksgiving... after having enjoyed Italian Thanksgiving for the previous two years. Not that there's that much difference in the traditional Thanksgiving meal. But I guess it's more the fact that these families love good food. Every meal has something about it that's memorable. They're great cooks and lively families... really, what more could one ask for. It's different from what I grew up with... not that my childhood experience was terrible. It just wasn't the same. But Thanksgiving doesn't seem to be the kind of holiday that provokes a lot of distant memories. Christmas does that. And maybe that's the quintessential "memory" holiday because of gifts, Santa, etc. But Thanksgiving is more about... well, what is it about? Obviously, giving thanks. But for most people it doesn't really have any meaning anymore except for a couple days off from work, a big meal and football. I'm not going to moralize about that. Everyone else does, so I'll just leave it there. Dave and I are planning a post-Christmas trip to San Diego once again. We went for a week last year and had a great time. This year it's likely to be a shorter trip, since Dave is planning a week in Mexico, hiking among the Mayan ruins. How cool is that, huh? Anyway... San Diego should be a restful and relaxing time for us. It was last year, even though we were right in the middle of a relationship transition-- specifically, breaking up. Needless to say, this put a damper on what was going to be our first trip somewhere together. It makes me laugh even now. But when you're friends first, you can work through a lot of things and we worked through that. Don't get me wrong... there are scars that remain. The challenge for me has been to continue our friendship and on-again romantic relationship while trying to purge myself of those feelings of anger and injustice. Those feelings are largely uncalled for, but they exist and pushing them under the surface only makes them resurface in some other way. So what was I talking about? :) Oh yes! San Diego. If any of you live in San Diego... or if you've visited frequently, we'd love to hear your suggestions for hotels, places to eat and things to do. Dave and I assembled quite a list of favorites on our last trip... but we can always use new ideas. We'll be there in early January.
I love Thanksgiving week... because of the food... the shortened work-week... and did I mention the food? As someone who derives much of his nutrition from boxed and canned goods requiring little preparation... there's something deliriously intoxicating about eating a meal that involves multiple courses and hours of work. Particularly if someone else is doing the work. I do know how to cook and I'm not a bad cook. In fact, I enjoy it-- at least as a social experience. But cultivating an image of someone who is incapable of cooking has saved me a great deal of work over the years. Besides, for holiday gatherings like Thanksgiving... most people prepare the main dishes on site and ask the rest of us to supply the side dishes. And side dishes aren't my favorite. Well... I do love sweet potatoes. And I also love cranberries. I could do without the green bean casserole. It was only recently that I discovered the phenomenon of the green bean casserole with the french fried onions on top. We're talking 6 or 7 years ago... so I've yet to recover from the trauma. We never had it in my home when I was growing up. Now, I came from a home where liver was an accepted part of the dinnertime meal-- accepted by Mom, that is... not the kids. We ate brussels sprouts, spinach in great quantities. We ate a lot of green beans. We ate a lot of cream of mushroom soup. But those two ingredients never lay in a steamy embrace in a hotdish in my house. My first occasion to taste the classic green bean casserole with the cream of mushroom soup and the french fried onions was a potluck at work in 1996. The words "There is no God" come to mind as I relive that experience in all its frightening detail. The beans were lifeless, a mushy dark green swimming in a white slimy sauce, garnished with oily, soggy fried onions. Being the perservering midwesterner that I was... I finished every bit of the green bean casserole on my plate. Then I washed my mouth out with soap. Ever since then, I've watched people who eat green bean casserole very closely because I'm not really sure if they're actually swallowing it. I look for the colleague who politely excuses himself and heads for the restroom. Or the cousin who leans over discreetly to cough into a handkerchief. The Food Network show "Unwrapped" offered a segment on the "yummy casserole that all America loves to eat." But I noticed that none of the people professing their delight in the casserole gave their full name and address to the camera. "Unwrapped" is hosted by Mark Summers. I talked to Mark a couple years ago about his obsessive compulsive disorder. On camera, he sat next to a dish of the green and white gooeyness. He seemed alright but his left eye was twitching uncontrollably. Watching the piece, I learned that a home economist at Campbell's invented the dish in the 1950's. If you put two ingredients in a bowl and stir, have you really invented something? People give me a hard time because I don't like it. They call me a communist. They point out that I can't play euchre. Others try to win me over THEIR version of green bean casserole. They'll say "you won't believe how good mine tastes." Again, with just three principle ingredients, I'm thinking I can probably imagine it. This Thanksgiving, I'll be with my boyfriend (nickname: Big and Tasty). He's Hispanic and his large Mexican family produces some of the best food on this planet. I know it won't happen, but if I see even one can of cream of mushroom soup... I running from the house screaming.
My friend Rick writes again from his whirlwind tour of Asia. Australasia: Sheep on the Rocks It’s hard to know what to make of New Zealand and Australia after a cursory visit over just a few days, but the overall impression is one of newness and refreshing simplicity. It brings to mind that Steve Martin line from LA Stories: “Why, some of these buildings are twenty years old!” Sydney even bears a strong geographical resemblance to Los Angeles. It’s a flat basin teeming with people, facing the harbor and backed against rugged mountains. Auckland is another city swept with bracing ocean breezes and unbreakably bound to the sea. Both countries have expanses of territory more populated by sheep than people, and ocean waves crashing all around their pristine coastlines. The impression of newness, though, is apocryphal. The Maori and other South Pacific islanders had been happily settled in New Zealand for half a millennium before the Europeans found them and wrecked their lives in the late 1700s. The aborigines of Australia can trace the longest continual cultural history in the world, back to the last Ice Age. These are not new kids on the block. See if you recognize this thumbnail national history. A gold rush not long after 1849 that brought a torrent of miners and farmers alike, feeding the furnaces of the Industrial Revolution and pushing the natives off their tribal lands in the process. This nation of immigrants carried the momentum of their single-minded productivity right through the postwar economic boom. That nation is Australia. The first load of 750 convicts came ashore here just a dozen years after the Declaration of Independence was signed by another bunch of outlaws in Philadelphia. So how to account for the freshly-scrubbed personality of a place where few things are allowed to be more weighty than cricket, rugby and sailing? I ascribe it to the gift of isolation. For most of its history, Australasia was at best a very long boat ride from anywhere, and at worst a place you could only hope to read about. Not thirty years ago, they paid Americans to move here. Today you have to be young, skilled, or rich—and preferably all three—to be anything more than a tourist or student in Australia and New Zealand. The splendid isolation that preserved and protected this corner of the world has finally fallen away, a victim of all the modern conveniences that have shrunk the planet in so many ways. While it was there, like a bell jar over the South Pacific, a civilized society incubated at a proper pace. It had the luxury of not having to be a military or economic superpower. It could concentrate on its own well being. Today it is prosperous, high-tech, often culturally edgy, and a fully engaged player on the world stage. Nothing brought that last point home more forcefully than the recent bombings in Bali that killed so many Australians. There are tinderbox domestic issues of trade, immigration, the environment, and the treatment of native people. Politics here are lively, and personal. That fresh feeling remains. The question is whether the region has evolved enough in its years of relative isolation to withstand the intrusions of today’s wicked world, and preserve its charm and innocence—not to be mistaken for naiveté—in a global community that usually places military might ahead of the America’s Cup. If so, perhaps we can learn a lot from it. -- Rick
My friend Rick writes again from his whirlwind tour of the Pacific Rim. Ava Gardner once infuriated the residents of Melbourne, Australia by pronouncing it the perfect place to make a movie about the end of the world. And so she did. I was an impressionable Midwestern 12-year-old when “On the Beach” hit movie theaters in 1959. I never forgot the stark scenes of newspapers blowing down the empty canyons of dead but undamaged American cities, nor the haunting strains of “Waltzing Matilda” that became the film’s mournful theme. It may have been schmaltz, but it played well in Iowa in the twilight of the Eisenhower administration, still three years before the Cuban missile crisis. More than forty years later I find myself sitting on a sunny spring morning in Melbourne, where Gregory Peck commanded the last American submarine after the fictional superpower nuclear exchange draped the globe in a deadly radioactive blanket. Birds are singing a lusty song, and soft warm breezes stir in the trees. On such a morning, Armageddon seems nowhere in sight. The most disturbing thing about the unseen war in that movie was the fact that we lost—everybody did. The survivors in Australia just died a little later than the rest of the earth’s population. It was a hopeless, unstoppable tragedy. There was no happy ending. We were jumpy in those days. There were fallout shelters marked with Civil Defense signs and stocked with crackers and water, and some people had fortified cellars at home. At school, we learned to duck under our desks when The Big One came. It’s more than a little silly to think we would survive the thermonuclear firestorm by huddling under desks and eating stale crackers, but it seemed sensible at the time. Without that kind of initiative, the Cold War rendered us neurotic victims of uncertainty and fear. Since the Gulf War a dozen years ago—and long after our inglorious exit from the quagmire of Vietnam—America has regained an unbecoming sense of national glee at its global invincibility. Our confidence was rattled temporarily when flaming jetliners were flung as if by giant catapults to lay siege to New York and Washington. Now we’re back on top, double-daring Saddam Hussein to say the careless word that makes us scorch his desert into molten glass. He and his country are unrelated to the attacks on our cities and citizens, but don’t bother us with the details. We are on a rapturous mission. No playground bully ever felt a finer sense of imminent, stupefying triumph. It has been a long time since the ugly American was so near-universally disliked, and often reviled. We were one of the few tough guys on the playground in the sixties when they chanted, “Yanqui go home,” and in the seventies when we got out of Southeast Asia and beat a hasty retreat from Iran. Now we’re a gang of one. Competition is generally welcomed in the world of business. We may come to miss it in the business of world domination. Membership in the Gang of One makes us the only remaining nation with the power to make peace. All the others can only make war—with missiles, bombs, or rocks; with poison gas and superflu; with treachery and surprise when their munitions fail them. Peace was once an ideal. Against some of these new weapons and tactics, it is the only defense. The role of single superpower is an unenviable one. We have become the evil Goliath, the nation you love to hate, with countless Davids who see themselves as virtuous in their singleminded struggle to sling a fatal stone our way. It’s enough to make you think about the bad old days of duck-and-cover drills. Wake up and smell the popcorn. The characters in the movie tried to carry on in the face of the inexorable advance of the lethal cloud. Much like us today, they held dinner parties and turned their backs on the gathering storm. And who could blame the residents of Melbourne for ignoring the rest of a bomb-toasted world, in a spot this beautiful? Let's have another iced coffee, and grill a barramundi, and invite Ava Gardner over for a few belts. Spring is especially lovely just before a nuclear winter. -- Rick
You could argue he's been flung. My friend Rick is globetrotting... on a tour of Asia that will last several days. He works for a media and technology company. When he has time, Rick observes life around him and sends me his musings... which I then transfer to my website immediately because his writing is so much better than mine. In any case... enjoy! Greetings from Hong Kong . It's no Nicaragua, but it'll do for now. Wish I had time to get to know it better, but I'm off for Bangkok in the morning. I've really been unable to dredge up any business potential there, but by the time I confirmed that, it would have taken another $4000 to change the reservation, so I'm forced to go and enjoy the place for the weekend. I saw on CNN today they have been having soccer matches there, played by baby elephants using a two-foot ball. How could I miss that? I've also heard that the thing to do in Thailand is to release a cage of birds for good luck. In America we call that "skeet." Hong Kong is intriguing. It's clean and seems prosperous, friendly and safe, and very Chinese. There's little English signage, and people like taxi drivers speak the bare minimum. When I got into a cab this morning to come back from a meeting, I gave the driver my room key card and he read the phone number, called the hotel on his cell phone, and presumably got directions. There's no obvious hint of the mainland Chinese occupation, just dark references to things that've happened "since 1997," such as business people migrating to Singapore. I did hear that Hong Kong television may now be legally received in homes in south China, where formally its widespread illegal reception was an open secret. It adds 30 million potential viewers to the 6 million or so landlocked in Hong Kong. South China businesses are beginning to run commercials on TV. In a kind of mimicry of the old line, "As seen on TV," they seem to derive benefit from the equivalent of "As seen on Hong Kong TV." I was booked into the Royal Palace Hotel in Kowloon, and I have no complaints about it. I have a 19th-floor view of the city, and there's a breakfast buffet (included) that is the best I've ever seen. Next door is a glittering shopping mall with a McDonald's and Mrs. Fields cookies in case of an emergency--such as finding eels on the breakfast menu. This afternoon I crossed Prince Edward Road and walked a block to the flower market. It's a square block or more of wall-to-wall flower shops, filled with the aroma of fresh flowers and steaming tea. In the next block were endless Chinese restaurants, and it all looked good--Peking duck hanging in the windows and all sorts of dim sum and pastries everywhere. But there wasn't anything in English, and the joints were packed to the rafters, so I opted for the mall and a teriyaki chicken sandwich at Oliver's House of Giant Sandwiches. Yesterday I had a fabulous Chinese lunch in the Pacific Place office towers with people from the BBC. If the local newspaper is a snapshot of a city's interests, Hong Kong is fixated on business. I suppose that makes sense. The headlines in the South China Morning Post are all about telecom layoffs, income tax irregularities, and the scrapping of the government's economic reforms office. And that's before you get to the business section, where--interestingly--a story on US housing starts makes the bottom of page one. But the real character of a place is found in the "In Brief" section, and Hong Kong does not disappoint. This very morning, it led with the curious headline, SHUNNED SON OF MARK SIX WINNER DRINKS DETERGENT. It seems the son of a man who won $5 million in the Mark Six lottery was despondent over his father's refusal to share any of the money, even after giving $1 to his sister. So he quaffed an Ivory Liquid cocktail in what must have been a bubbly attempt to do himself in. But the real gem was the baffling LAWMAKER CALMS FEARS WITH PLASTIC CHICKEN. That's the stuff of newspaper legend, or at least the back page of Columbia Journalism Review. (The story wasn't nearly as good as the headline. A legislator had used a model of a chicken to show how the gullet could be safely removed to eliminate fear of dangerous bacterial contamination, while still delivering the bird with head and feet intact to discriminating Chinese cooks.) What next? I can't imagine. -- Rick
There are some days when I wish I could read the paper like normal people do. It becomes a fantasy that I try to fulfill when I'm on vacation: that morning where you rise about 7am... shower and then walk across the street to the cafe for a cup of coffee and the morning paper. I usually take my computer and read the electronic edition of the New York Times off my wireless network. But it's still just about the same thing, minus the ink on your fingers. For my job, this shouldn't be a fantasy... it should be my modus operandi on weekdays. Well at least I should be reading the newspaper. But it doesn't happen. Here's why: I have hundreds of pages of reading material to churn through every day. For instance... my Tuesday reading material for interviews I have on Wednesday: urlLink The Natural History of the Rich ; urlLink Yes Yes Y'All: Oral History of Hip Hop's First Decade ; urlLink David Rockefeller: Memoirs ; and urlLink Redeeming the Dial: Radio, Religion and Popular Culture in America . This isn't the situation every day... don't misunderstand. But I have enough of these days that very little outside personal reading gets done... not to mention reading for information or greater understanding of the world at large. What's worse is that my workload frazzles me to the point that my free time becomes entirely unproductive in terms of reading. I need the veg-out time away from books so my personal reading projects go unfinished. And, even worse, than that... all this speed reading and skimming is diminishing my ability to concentrate. Does that make sense? It's like I have this growing ADHD or something. Vacation isn't enough. A long vacation is called for. Months away... months . Not likely to happen. Well, there are no perfect answers. I have a good job. I make great money. I have my tiny measure of stardom. But man is my brain tired and addled... and there are days where so little of my life feels like my own. Thank goodness those days are rare... because the other days it's easier to remember what a great situation I'm in.
Those of you who have followed the continuing story of my on-again, off-again boyfriend... feel free to laugh a little when I tell you that Friday was our first year anniversary. Considering that we've been together about 6 months out of that year, that's a .5... which is a darn good batting average. It might not be so good for a relationship... but we look at it this way: we've spent a year with each other, trying to make something that worked well, with a few hiccups, work better. If it takes a few tries, then you can conclude that it's something we consider worth trying for. And we do. We are two stubborn, self-possessed people. We would probably be a lot happier together if we were dumber. But we seem to have a lot of brain power for over-analyzing ourselves and our relationship. What I think we've finally figured out is how closely tied together we are. I'm not saying we have a 100% chance of success. Those who are closest to us know there are significant obstacles in the way of our success. But all couples face obstacles. No two people start out a relationship with everything being perfect. Love is an act of will, I believe... when the gooey feelings fade away and the reality of making a life together reveals itself.
We had a nice weekend... spending part of it out of town, seeing friends, talking, committing the occasional illegal act... all in all a productive time for us as a couple. That's something that has come slowly to us. We were best friends almost instantly when we met a year ago. We felt the electricity that happens when two people are on the same wavelength and can collaborate to make something significant happen. But we were both too stubborn to give up the measure of independence that two people have to give up to be a couple-- one unit. Well, nothing is ever perfect and we're far from it. But we've learned this lesson and we're working hard to create something different this time around. It's cool to look at the handsome guy who is my boyfriend and feel such a strong connection to him. We went to see The Ring on Friday afternoon. I know people are arguing over whether it's any good or not. We liked it, despite plot weakness. Frankly, both of us were ready for a scary movie. It's been years since I was truly frightened at the movies. This wasn't the fright of all time... but it was a good scare and that was worth the price of the (reduced) admission. At this point, I'm looking forward to The Two Towers-- the next in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. And let's not forget Star Trek: Nemesis-- because I can't resist watching everything and nearly everyone get destroyed. Ah, but is it ever truly over....
... country turned toward the GOP. But us Gay Michiganian Democrats are celebrating a couple important wins this morning. urlLink Democrat Jennifer Granholm is the state's first female Governor. Voters in Ypsilanti rejected an effort to repeal the urlLink city's anti-discrimination ordinance by a margin of 2 to 1. It's notable for a couple of reasons. First, billionaire Tom Monaghan personally funded the effort to wreck the ordinance. And this is the second time that voters have rejected an effort to do away with it. So there are a couple reasons to be cheerful. If you need some more... check out Chrisonomicon's selection of urlLink quotes which don't mean what they did when they were first written .
...I can't stand the new urlLink ESPN show "Around the Horn," I think urlLink Max Kellerman looks damn good!
Only because I was sick. And am sick. And will be sick, perhaps, for a while longer. It came on quickly last night. D went to a Halloween party and I stayed home and slept. And got sick... and by the way... I'm not going to say more about this... but I HATE being sick. Anyway... after the incident, I felt much better and now I'm experiencing something like an annoying sore throat and stuffy nose. D and I made costumes for last night by pinning dozens of fabric remnants to our clothes. We planned to take Bibles and go as material witnesses . Get it? Material... well, we thought it was cute, if not totally funny. We nixed plans to go as snipers - too close to recent events; weapons of mass destruction - too involved, given the time we had for prep; and the axis of evil - somewhat old and no third person to join us. I've been thinking about a sentence I came across in a book I was reading yesterday. In commenting on his more straitlaced days, a man says, "I was too old when I was younger." I was always Mr. Goody Goody... the kid who never got in trouble for anything... the kid who never took any risks... the kid who never spoke up. I'm still some of things in some measures... we rarely make a complete personality turnaround. But I have a lot more fun these days. And I'm not afraid to speak up about things anymore. My boyfriend has helped bring out this new side of my personality... one of several ways in which this particular relationship has molded me. While I'm rambling on about a number of things, a note about rage . I was writing the other day about being frustrated and feeling something is wrong. On this general theme of frustration and such, my friend Matt wrote to say that he's feeling the same kind of thing... except it's more of a rage. He's angry at how work interferes with his personal life. I have that problem, too... work that never seems to end. Most of the time, I try to take over and just end the work because I want time to myself or with my boyfriend. But it's hard to do because, like many people I know, I have one of those jobs where the work could go on forever. It's not like a factory job where, once the car is finished, it's finished. I study books and articles so I can ask people questions about them. There's no one to say alright your studying is done . You can always study more. I guess what I need is someone to tell me I'm finished. This situation upsets me, although it's less of a feeling of rage and more a feeling of sadness. Not that I don't ever experience anger. It's rare for me... and even more rare for me to express anger. But I do feel it... and I'm never exactly sure what to do about it. For instance, I feel a lot of anger toward my boyfriend. I could argue that it's not hard to have these feelings... given all we've gone though over the past year. I'm not talking about the kind of anger where one never wants to speak to someone again. I've never felt that. But I guess I feel this anger toward D as a kind of balance along with the obviously very strong emotional attraction I have to him. I think if that kind of stuff were left unprocessed... it would lead to a pretty f*cked up relationship. But I've considered this anger and weighed it carefully. It was at the forefront of my mind as I urged him to move to Chicago a couple months ago. I thought about often as he and I talked over the ensuing weeks. He would write to say he missed me and I would say that I missed him, too, and I would also think of that anger. And when we talked about him moving back and us getting back together... I thought about that anger for a long time. But in the end, I decided I wanted him. I wanted him and needed him... and the anger is now intertwined with the intense love and closeness I feel to him. I continue to process it and the ultimate goal is to purge it, I think. But that takes time... and while I wish feelings of anger died as quickly as love seems to spring to life, that's one of the things that makes life interesting.
Last time, I wrote about my workout and specifically about my diet. I wrote about how I struggled with a weight of 165-170lbs, which was fine for many guys who are 5 feet, 11 inches... but left me with a lot of unnecessary bodyfat. I considered my desire for a lean, defined musculature... and my interest in the concept of urlLink lower calorie diets . I came to the conclusion that I was eating basically the right foods... but the wrong quantities. In March 2001, I implemented my modest plan. I would eat when I was hungry. I would stop when I was full. The food would be a good mix of the food groups and, given that I don't eat at home, a halfway decent mix of fats, proteins and carbs. On March 5, 2001, I weighed 165 lbs. I continued my workout as I had been before... lifting 3-4 times a week and doing small amounts of cardio-- usually 1-2 20-minute sessions a week. The only thing that changed was the way I ate. And remember, I did nothing drastic. You could boil it down to this: I stopped cleaning up my plate. The weight started dropping off slowly. on 3/15/01, I weighed 164lbs; 3/29/01- 163lbs; 4/14/01- 159lbs; 4/30/01- 158lbs; 5/21/01- 157lbs; 6/1/01- 155lbs; 6/16/01- 150lbs; 6/28/01- 148lbs. And that's where I decided I'd gone far enough. And the interesting thing is, that's where my body seemed to say that it had gone far enough, too. In the 18 months since then, my weight has swung as low as 143lbs when I'm not working out... and as high as 150lbs the day after a particularly large pasta dinner. The shirtless pic of me on my website shows the results of this effort. Now, let's consider the consequences. What I did gave me a very defined physique, which was my aim. I lost a lot of bodyfat... so much that each winter now I have to take flax oil supplements so I don't get eczema. I also lost some muscle-- there's no way I could drop 15lbs without losing some. The interesting thing about being more defined is that it makes what muscle you have seem to be... bigger or something like that. Guys would come up to me at the gym and guess my weight at 175, even though I weighed 25 pounds less. Because I lost muscle, I couldn't lift as much as before, though. In physical terms, I've also gone through quite a change. I seem to burn food much faster... which might not be what you'd expect. My metabolism seems not to have slowed at all. In fact, I feel better than ever and my body seems to run more efficiently. I have to be more careful about my blood sugar because I'm eating less. But I've become used to this. I'm slightly colder... and this surprised me until I read the information about people who pursue what's sometimes called a urlLink super low calorie diet . I have a high body temperature and that's still the case. But I do get chilled more easily than I used to. I've assumed this was related to the lower bodyfat. It might be but that's not been determined yet. So you get the idea? There are decided benefits and disadvantages to this approach. What you want to achieve for your own body will determine which of these results were good or not so good. For myself, I'm happy. I'm pushing my weight up to 150 and I might even go as high as 155. To do this, I'll need to increase my caloric intake and I'll probably have to give up some definition for a while. But that's the tradeoff. I'm somewhat of a hard gainer, so weight comes on with difficulty. I'll add one thing. If nothing else, this has shown me how important diet is to the overall look of one's body... particularly the abdominals. Some guys have abs that are very sensitive to diet... the definition can disappear the day after a couple beers. Mine are more resilient but it truly was my changes in diet that brought out the visible evidence of all the work I has doing on them. When guys ask about abs, which is often the question that I get, I talk about exercise but I say twice as much about diet. Because for many of us, that's the key to having the abs... or the other elements of definition that are important to us. I don't know how valuable any of this essay is. But at least I thought I could explain my approach. I certainly don't mean to imply that it's the best way to go for you. In fact, a few of my friends thought it wasn't the best way for me, either. Some people grew anxious about me in the summer of '01 when the weight was coming off. But I'm glad that I pursued this path because of what it taught me about listening to my body's signals.
Every once in a while, I get a question about my approach to working out or to diet. I usually don't say much because I don't feel qualified to dispense with a lot of advice. Most of the time, I point guys in the direction of books like " urlLink The Complete Book of Abs " or " urlLink The Complete Book of Shoulders and Arms ." Both of those books have dozens of exercises and I use them as references for new workout ideas all the time. Some guys will laugh but especially back when I was just getting started with workouts, I used magazines like urlLink Men's Fitness as guides... not only because of the good looking guys inside... but also the wide variety of workout routines and exercises I could read about over the course of the year. MF isn't perfect but I've kept the exercise sections of the magazines for years. In fact, I still have them filed in folders, according to the body part exercised. I think books like " urlLink High Intensity Bodybuilding ," " urlLink Training Nutrition " and " urlLink A Practical Approach to Strength Training " are great sources for information. Jockohomo highly recommends " urlLink Strength Training Anatomy ." I don't have this book yet, but it's on my Amazon Wish List... and remember, my birthday is only 7 months away. LOL So anyway, I've read a few different sources to learn about how my body builds muscle and burns energy. My workouts aren't perfect, but I experiment with new ideas and pay attention to how my body is responding. I think listening to your body is even more important in terms of diet. I took a somewhat radical turn in the spring of 2001. Up until then, I'd weighed anywhere from 165-170lbs. In March 2001, I had the time to take a good hard look at myself. I liked the progress from the workout, but I wasn't pleased with my definition... and my weight was at 172, which was unacceptable for me. I was carrying around too much bodyfat. I kept thinking that I was eating reasonably well. I had an excellent working knowledge of nutrition. I had read tons of stuff about the various ways that experts recommend mixing proteins, carbs and fats to have a proper diet. As far as I could see, I was doing well in that regard. In the end, I decided that I was eating too much. I had done some reading about people who had made significant cuts in caloric intake. Not cuts in certain types of calories like carbs or fat... but an overall reduction in calories consumed. As long as they went about it the right way, they often felt better and there's some evidence that humans might live much longer lives if they reduce their caloric intake. I'm always the synthesizer. I take information from a lot of sources to create my own path. So I started to ask myself some simple questions. How much food do I eat? When I eat, do I eat beyond the point of being full? Do I eat when I'm not hungry because of the habit of eating? As I answered these questions, I discovered that even though I was eating decent food for the most part, I was probably eating too much. I decided to begin an experiment. I would eat when I was hungry. I would stop when I was full, regardless of whether the plate was full or empty. I would try cutting a little more fat out of my diet... in small ways. Since I eat out all the time, this would be easy. The veggie burrito comes with melted cheese... order it without cheese. Huevos rancheros at the gay bar's Sunday Brunch comes on two fried tortillas... ask that they don't fry the tortillas and skip the cheese. Nothing radical... but a slightly more vigilant approach to already careful choices to rid food of some of the more visible fat. Next time, I'll write about how the experiment went.
Maybe it happens when you reach a certain age. It might be a midlife crisis for some people. Or it might be an episode of massive change that repeats itself every few years. I seem to go through one of those every 4-5 years. In the past, it's involved a new job and a move to another state. I thought about doing just that this summer. I looked at a couple of possibilities and compared them to what I have now and decided I was going to stay put. But the impetus to change is a strong one and once the idea is planted in my head, it's hard to shake. Or maybe it's not just the idea of change. Maybe it's a true desire to make change. So for the past few months, I've been thinking about that. I've been thinking about the work I do; and the balance of work and my personal life. I've felt a growing restlessness with my situation. It's a frustration that has to do with one big thing mainly: I've lost the ability to read books I'm interested in. Well, maybe I haven't lost it, but I've misplaced it, perhaps. I have so much to read for the job that I do, that reading has become a job... a chore... an unpleasurable experience. And so what little personal time I have becomes an extended period of vegging out. I accomplish nothing and whole weekends disappear without so much as the turning of one page in a book, magazine or newspaper. I've interpreted this as a kind of brain burnout. And so 2003 is going to be a year of change. I'm going to make a series of changes to my job duties and the result is going to be more free time for myself. I have a bunch of new and exciting challenges ahead, too. And I can concentrate on the things I enjoy doing most. I might even take a sabbatical-- go to Harvard for a year to study or something like that. I think sometimes what others consider to be our greatest achievement can become our most confining prison. The point of living a good life is to do what you find enjoyable. And when it's no longer enjoyable, then you should pack up and move on. Sometimes this is possible and sometimes it's not. But for me in 2003, it will be possible and that's what I'm going to do. Around the Web... Today's urlLink New York Times Magazine has a large section devoted to the lives of famous people who passed away in 2002. Among them is urlLink Harry Hay , the father of the modern gay movement. Armisted Maupin has written a thoughtful piece about him.
It's been a busy weekend here... and it's barely started. Although, I guess for most of us, the holidays is one long weekend. Dave is working... I'm taking it easy... and we're using the evenings to watch movies we've missed and catch up a little bit. Lots of talking. I think the bf and I will be talking for the rest of our lives. It's one of the things we do very well and that will continue whether or not we're together. Even if a small portion of it is on IM. Dave has this penchant for wanting to conduct long conversations on IM... particularly ones that involve subjects he doesn't like to face directly... or when he's on a fishing expedition, so to speak. He's very funny that way because some things he'll face directly and others that he'd prefer to do from behind a shield. It's an interesting vulnerability that he has. Now it's only rarely that he wants to do this-- like once in the last 3 months. Most conversations we have face to face. And although I protest for all the obvious reasons, it's interesting because the kinds of conversations we have using IM are quite thought provoking and sometimes eloquent. They follow different patterns than the face to face conversations, there are different dynamics to the way we talk compared to the way we write to each other. It's just so damn weird to be writing an IM to someone who is sitting downstairs. I'd put a stop to it completely, but on those rare times it occurs I'm always intrigued by what might happen in the exchange. And then there's the added benefit of being able to have a log of the conversation to read later. When Dave moved to Chicago for several weeks, he didn't have a phone and so there would be an occasional call from a pay phone. But most often it was an IM from him that would make my computer beep at 3 or 4am... waking me up for a conversation. So when it happens now it brings back a kind of nostalgia, even as I roll my eyes. The kid and I just went to see The Wild Thornberry's Movie. It's not half bad. The boy enjoyed himself and now my stomach is frightfully upset over the sugar overload I gave it. I had a bag of Sour Skittles and a large Pepsi. Sometimes even one cookie makes my stomach ache so you can imagine how all that crap is affecting my blood sugar. My own fault, right? While I'm thinking about it, the National Institutes of Health has begun the first testing of the supposed benefits of a urlLink super low-calorie diet . Many researchers believe such a urlLink diet will prolong life. Here's urlLink a piece from NPR about it.
Hope you had a good one! I did the unthinkable and stayed away from my computer for nearly the entire day. Now, that's saying a lot for a guy who lives with his computer... from the moment he wakes up at 5am till around 11pm at night. I'm a slave... what can I say? But I liked having the time away from it, too. It was a great Christmas with the 35 members of Dave's extended family. It's a traditional Mexican Christmas with American add-ins, so along with the tamales and Santa, there's baked beans and swedish meatballs. We had a great time. Today, I intend to be quite lazy. I'll do the laundry because it's screaming to be done. But only the projects that are screaming to get done will get done. Other than that, I'm planning to curl up with a urlLink good book ... away from my computer. My best present: my bf got me a new pair of urlLink Oakley half wire sunglasses ... to replace the pair of Oakleys I lost this summer. Dave and I saw urlLink Gangs of New York in Christmas Eve. We liked it... even though the reviews have been mixed. Daniel Day Lewis puts on a magnificent performance... as if that's a surprise. If you go , just be aware that it's a nearly 3 hour time commitment. This means that the extra large 72 oz Bucket O' Beverage may cause discomfort if the movie becomes riveting. OK... so do you ever fantasize about what you'd do if you won the lottery? I've been thinking about what I'd do if I won the $315 million Powerball jackpot. Let's do some math. Assume 45% will disappear in taxes: that's still about $173 million. Let's assume a 25 year payout: about $6.9 million a year. Give half to your boyfriend: $3.5 million a year. Now give yourself an annual spending allowance: $200,000. After all, you're going to continue working, right? That leaves you with about $3.3 million a year for investing, charitable giving, paying off the parents' house, etc. Um... that's a lot of money. Sometimes I think about what the minimum winnings would be to make me happy. I think I could be very happy winning $250,000. Assuming $125,000 after taxes... that's enough to buy a new car and make a hefty downpayment on a house, with plenty left over. Ah, the fantasies...
I put a new addition on the list of recommended weblogs. Check out urlLink Mikesosoft if you get the chance. He and his urlLink boyfriend put the page through a redesign over the weekend. It looks great... he looks great... and so does his boyfriend. Now theoretically, one could read both weblogs and get an interesting perspective on that relationship. But I think it's more likely that we'll see clearly why these two guys get along well and have managed to stay together for about six months. My friend, Chris, in DC has returned to his weblog. It's been a busy time for Chris this fall... but he got back into the business of writing as soon as he was able to. I'll have more to write tomorrow... but Dave and I are about to continue our Homage to Josh Hartnett ... with one of his early movies, "Town and Country."
but Dave and I have managed to avoid almost all Christmas shopping. That is, until tomorrow. I'm almost dreading the trip to the mall on Saturday, because it will be disastrous. I suppose we could wait till 3am to go to Kmart and shop. But an important point: the people who shop at Kmart at 3pm are scary enough... I don't want to think about who I would find there 12 hours later. We've bought for each other. This trip will be for family and Dave's son, who has declared his interest in a Gameboy Advance this Christmas... along with 65 other toys-- each of which costs more than a small quantity of gold boullion. I was off on the whole Trent Lott thing... saying I thought he would be out by Wednesday. He was much more stubborn than I realized. But at last, urlLink he's stepped down . I had a conversation with someone online the ther day about writing. He likes some of my writing here... and I complained about the highly variable quality of my work. Sometimes I think the quality of my work here is quite good. But most of the time it's just fair. I don't think it's ever really awful. But I've been trying to write as much as I can here for the sake of exercising the mind and getting the creative energies to flow more freely. The guy I was talking with mentioned that he had some good results experimenting with automatic writing. Now by that I don't mean the kind of writing you do when supposedly a spirit writes messages using your hand. I'm talking about the Surrealist approach to automatic writing. That flowing, stream-of-conscious approach has a certain allure. But I'm not very good at emptying my mind... even though sometimes it seems like I've already done it.:) I'm also not good at just writing without worrying about grammar, punctuation or spelling. I do believe, though, that there's a great advantage to writing regularly and often. Dave and I saw urlLink "The Two Towers" last night. I had a great time and came away with that full feeling that one gets after watching a satisfying 3 hour movie. I think Gandalf's reappearance is one of the most thrilling parts of "Towers" so I wasn't as pleased with the anticlimactic presentation of it in the movie. I think that's my only complaint, though. The battle at Helm's Deep was brilliant. The second movie varies more from the book than the first one. But the re-construction of the story and its progression seems right to me. So as someone who has read the books close to a dozen times, I still came away pleased... loving the technology that finally has allowed this story to come to the big screen with such grandeur. Gollum is one of the most amazing special effects creations I've seen.
I don't talk much about politics here... but check out these articles from the urlLink New York Times and urlLink Washington Post about Trent Lott. In controversies like this, the weekend is always telling... does the furor die down or does it grow? I think it's growing... from the tone of the weekend news shows to the newspaper coverage. Let's predict that Trent Lott will resign as Senate Majority Leader by... Wednesday.
... to carve out time to write here because it's so enjoyable. My recent silence isn't because I've lost interest, it's mainly that I've been overwhelmed with work and activities. Dave and I are in our second holiday season as a couple, and that's doubled our required holiday parties, dinners, gatherings, etc. You know how it is... we're all rushed... trying to buy gifts without actually going to any real store and facing the onslaught of screaming and crying and carrying-on. And that's just from the adults. Dave has been working in retail lately. Often now, he comes home with stories of idiot customer behavior... total impatience, complete nastiness, outrageous demands. I envy those who can be kind helpers in the face of all that. I would just haul off and give a few of the worst offenders a piece of my mind. Not that I have that much to spare. Like urlLink Chrisonomicon , my urlLink head is bursting open with new ideas for the coming year... many changes, new excitement, new challenges... I can't wait!! I'm kind of excited about seeing urlLink Nemesis tonight. I'm not a big trekkie. But I have heard urlLink some good things about this movie.
I ever enjoy a quiet evening in the coffee shop with a good book again? I ever feel like a stretch of my time is my own to savor... not to hoard? I ever be satisfied with a particular level of personal achievement? I ever find the kind of love I yearn for? I love questions that make you stop and think hard. These are the ones that I'm thinking about now. Too much work... too little time with my boyfriend... time for decisions... hmmmm....
If you missed urlLink Dame Edna's appearance on NPR Saturday, you missed some of the best moments on NPR in recent years. Sure beats a panel discussion on healthcare reform. Hear either urlLink the piece itself or the urlLink complete interview . Inches It's official: I'm 5'9" I used to think I was 5'11" and then I thought I can't be that tall so I guessed I was 5'10." But last night, I got measured and now it can be revealed with certainty... i'm 5'9"... and a half. Whether or not the "half" is important depends on whether or not I date a guy who is taller or shorter than me. I wonder if being shorter will make my penis seem larger?
... and I finish the dreaded leg workout in time to enjoy the rest of the day. I like Saturdays for catching up on all sorts of lazy-time activities... including checking through the weblogs of friends. And so here is a roundup from Blog World: Jeff Stryker's career is expanding. Not only is he sticking his big thing where the sun don't shine... urlLink he's singing about it . Horribly. Thanks, urlLink Jonno , for informing us of this crime against humanity. urlLink Jimbo ... who, besides being handsome, is one of the more urlLink sensible gay men on the Internet, offered up a Nazgul quiz for us Tolkien geeks: urlLink Which Ringwraith Are You? I also giggled like a scholgirl looking at the Smoking Gun's collection of urlLink Best Mug Shots of 2002 . That link courtesy of urlLink TRC .
... to be in right now. It's a moment of high satisfaction... a brilliant flash of contentment in what is already a profoundly happy existence. That's a lot of blabber to say mainly that I have this intense and somewhat inexplicable feeling of contentment today. Part of the reason is having the day off... I'm sure of that. Part of the reason is also that empty and clean apartment that I've talked about for days here; part of it is also the long, uninterrupted stretches of Proust that I've enjoyed last night and today; there's also the 10 hours of sleep last night-- almost unheard of for me. Well, I could go on... but there it is. I'm where I want to be- in my favorite coffee shop, with my books around me, my phone and my PDA in their precise positions on the table in front of me. Maybe I'm a control freak about these small things. It might be some weird but benign manifestation of obsessive-compulsive disorder, I don't know. But in the absence of Dave, I find a great deal of enjoyment and even a certain measure of comfort in creating a precise order around me. It could be that I'm trying to make up for a distinct lack of order in some other part of my life; or I'm trying to cover up a part of me that's extremely dissatisfied. Now, I happen to think the latter isn't true with me. But maybe there's some truth in the former. I think the feeling that we lack control in one or more parts of our life causes us to be even more careful with the rest of ourselves. Or this is my theory. But I also think there's a part of me that likes everything in its place... perfectly arranged... giving the impression of having been undisturbed. I think I would be truly impossible to live with if there weren't a part of me that also welcomed chaos and uncertainty. Those are the warring factions of my life. For the moment, order has the upper hand. I went with three friends for Indian food last night. We went to my favorite Indian restaurant in town and I ordered my standard meal: onion salad, garlic naan and dal tarka - the tasty combination of lentils, garlic, ginger and other spices. Now I always order it "hot." But last night it was hot . As my friend Matt says, it's the kind of heat that makes you cry but makes you want to eat more. And eat I did! Every bit of it. I weighed 1.6 lbs heavier today at the gym... and I know exactly what it is... rice and a heap of dal tarka . The onion salad is a special indulgence-- albeit a rare one. The onion salad is literally sliced, raw onions, with a few cucumber and tomato wedges, sprinkled with lime and cilantro. Raw onions have many health benefits-- antioxidant properties, B vitamins, they're anti-mucosal and they have anti-septic properties. I'm also keenly aware of their anti-people properties. But a long, determined swishing of Listerine this morning followed by sustained brushing seems to have eradicated the onion breath. Still, when I got in the shower after the workout, the steam rising from the water as it hit my body had the faint odor of... onions. I don't mind... I love onions and garlic. But I try to think of others-- others I might encounter during the day- not others who might be in the shower with me. :) I was showering alone. In fact, I've been showering alone a lot lately, so to speak. For a long time now, I've not wanted sex. I've been in this space where, when it's been available, sex has seemed like a burden. Not that I'm a slut, but this is a new feeling for me. I've never been highly sexed, but I've always enjoyed sex and usually I'd find an excuse to have some every couple weeks. But that's not where I am these days, I guess. This is probably a good thing because I'm not dating or involved with anyone right now. So any sex I would be having would some anonymous hookup... or with a friend who probably began as an anonymous hookup. I'm not against the anonymous hookup... as long as we've covered all the relevant safety issues. I've listened to many people denounce the hookup as an intensely demeaning experience. They say we're making the act of sex a cheap trick; that we don't understand the true meaning and passion of the sexual experience-- which we could never experience in a hookup; that, leaving aside the physical satisfaction, we're abusing our psychological self. Usually when someone launches into this argument, I stay silent. First of all, because they usually go on for a very long time. And second, because I don't entirely disagree with them. I think for some people, it is a demeaning and psychologically damaging experience. These people feel empty and awful afterward because of what they've done. Personally, I've never felt that way. I don't think it's because I'm totally lacking in personal awareness. I think it might be because I have a strong sense of myself; or maybe it's because when I have hooked up, I've known exactly why I was doing it and what I should and should not expect from the experience. Or it might be some other reason. Under no condition will I tell the person who has those negative feelings about hookups that he's weak or not worldly enough or whatever. Everyone has the right to their own feelings, just as all of us can make our own moral decisions. But I don't feel that I personally suffer because I've hooked up before. The fact is, though, I don't feel like hooking up now. And I haven't for some time-- long enough that I'm wondering if I've turned some kind of corner. There are times now when I think sex would be great. But as opportunities have arisen in recent months, I've turned them down. I think it's because what I want more than anything is affection... to be held at night... to be kissed... to be touched. We all want these things. And I think most of us are smart enough to know that the embrace, the encircling arms, the gentle kiss are the gifts of a lover... not a guy you met on the Internet 45 minutes ago. Right now, I prefer that kind of intimacy enough that I don't feel the need to get off with a stranger... or anyone whom I'm not dating. I wonder how long this will last? I'm not saying it will never happen again.
to overwhelmed . Well, that might be too harsh a word for it. But life is busy this week, which is why I didn't post yesterday. BUT... tomorrow-- as I've been telling all my friends-- is a day off . Yes... a day in which I don't work. A day when I won't awake at 4:30am... I won't frantically finish last minute studying for work. Instead, I'll rise at 6:30am... walk across the street to the cafe at 7am for coffee and the newspaper... to the gym at 9am... back to reading at 11am... hanging with friends... then back to urlLink astonishingly clean loft for a quiet, softly lit evening with a book. You just know that isn't going to turn out that way, right? But it's fun to dream. urlLink My favorite restaurant in Ann Arbor is closing next weekend... dammit! I've had some of the longest, most leisurely, most enjoyable meals ever there. So the Bistro will be sorely missed. But, we'll go out celebrating. I've organized a party of 10 good friends to eat and drink there one last time!! My friend Steve in Grand Rapids informs me that urlLink support for the War on Terror remains as high as ever among some of our canine friends . Although I had hoped for a stronger showing from the Rottweiler community...
Man oh man... how many times have we said that to the guy we just broke up with? And how many times have we been on the receiving end of that suggestion? I think, aside from the struggle to making a failing relationship work, there's no more difficult process than trying to rebuild a friendship after a relationship has ended. Sometimes, it's easy and natural and friends hardly notice as a couple reverts to two individuals. But that's rare. What's more common is two individuals who no longer speak to each other... who bear a certain level of animosity toward each other. But I would also argue that what happens most of the time is something in between those extremes: two guys who say hi when they run into each other, mumble awkwardly about the weather and how busy they've been, and part ways. Frankly, I think that kind of arms-length, strained cordiality is almost as bad as two people who have stopped speaking to each other. It's a loss... potentially a huge loss because of lost opportunities for friendship and companionship. After all, two people got together thinking they had the right ingredients to build a relationship and a life together. The relationship didn't work, but those qualities that made two guys think it might still exist, right? Now, I don't think remaining friends after a breakup is necessary or mandatory. If your boyfriend abused you, chances are there won't be many cozy meetings for coffee and conversations after the breakup. And sometimes, there's a negative chemistry or a series of events that sours a relationship to the point that friendship would only be forced. I have a previous relationship that ended sourly and friendship with the ex has been impossible. I'm not beating myself up about it. I've tried and failed and at some point, I have to move on. Again, being friends with every single ex you have isn't mandatory, and I don't consider it to be a badge of honor, necessarily. But I think too many relationships decay without the individuals working hard enough to build something new to replace it. And that's a loss... for the two individuals involved, friends and family. Why do we turn away? There are as many reasons as there are failed relationships. Sometimes, there was nothing else there to begin with. It amazes me how this guy I'm dating can seem to be so cool to talk and hang out with. I can't get enough of him. But something just isn't happening and when we break up and try to go on being friends, we discover we have very little in common. The mutual sexual attraction or the blindness caused by romance led us to think there was some kind of connection. It can take a while after a breakup to realize that there's nothing there without the sex. I think some guys are so deeply hurt by the end of the relationship, or how it ended, or why it ended... that they can't get past it. I don't have a lot of sympathy for this situation. Well, let's put it this way. After a certain period of time has passed, I find that I'm less sympathetic to someone who is experiencing these feelings. Some guys are slow to forgive and slow to let go and move on. Beyond a certain recovery period, I think this is a character flaw. I think sometimes it's because we feel guilt about how things turned out. I loved one of my boyfriends very much. But I struggled with his relocation to another city. That and other factors led me to break up. I thought I was doing the right thing at the time. But for months after, I was bothered by my decision, how I had handled it, etc. The consequence was that my relationship with my ex was rather shallow. I didn't want to hang out with him much because I felt guilty... and I avoided just about every opportunity to deepen the friendship. It limped along for more than a year... mainly because my ex wouldn't give up on it. Time has a way of healing wounds and he and I now have a great friendship that's growing closer all the time. Time was key in this situation and it is in many severed relationships. I've seen many couples try to force themselves into a friendship... merely because they think they have to... or that it's expected of them. Those "friendships" make everyone uncomfortable and you might find most of your friends running away when they see the two of you coming. My ex, Dave, and I might be mini-experts in the art of being boyfriends and then friends. Not that we're doing it right... just that we've done it enough times that we've managed to improve each time. Dave and I have only been friends for about 2 years, but our friendship is about as deep as any friendship I've known. And we've discovered that when we're apart there's a deep yearning to be with each other. For a long time, we thought that might mean more than friendship, but I think we both know now that it probably doesn't. It's just a highly unusual and very rewarding friendship. The first two times we tried dating and then broke up, we made all the common mistakes, were insensitive to each other in all the standard ways... and in all the special ways that one can be insensitive to an ex who is also his roommate. It was a strain... not to the breaking point... but a strain, nonetheless. A few months after the second breakup, Dave had the opportunity to move to Chicago. I was happy to see him go because I knew that the city would present him with many opportunities. But I also didn't want him in the house anymore. I was at the point of trying anything that would get him away from me... not permanently... but enough that I could have my own space. Well, I've already outlined the basic elements of that story here. He moved... love rekindled... he returned... and we began version 3.0 of our relationship. How are we doing at the end of this go at Love ? We're doing very well. I think there are a couple of reasons for this. First of all, I think we have our priorities straight with the friendship taking priority over all else. And what makes that more than just pie-in-the-sky talk is what has generally been a high level of communication. We talked ourselves through this final attempt at a relationship in ways we had never done before... and in ways that I had never done in any relationship before. It was hard, but we developed a way to talk about nearly every issue that came up... including several discussions about whether the relationship itself could continue. We talked all the way through the unwinding of the relationship... to the end. And we're still talking about the aftermath, about our friends, the feelings that we still have for each other... well it's a long list. We were on the same page when we broke up... although I hesitate to make too much of this because I think this doesn't happen often-- even though copious communication can help make it possible. I'm still going to reclaim more space for myself in the coming months. Dave is moving out and while he'll be in the same town and quite close by, we'll both have some extra space in which to live our lives. I think steps like this make the friendship even stronger because you're removing potential points of friction. And when we're talking about two former boyfriends trying to move on and date and occasionally hookup and all the rest... living apart can only be a good thing! I think that are plenty of reasons not to continue any kind of friendship after a relationship. Some of them are good reasons. But I think that too often, we'll allow ourselves to take the easy way out and miss the opportunity to cultivate a new kind of relationship with someone who knows us quite well. The boyfriends who have become friends have turned out to be some of my sharpest critics... AND most loyal confidants.
... is clean. The living room, kitchen, bathrooms, my bedroom... and now, like a crazed obsessive-compulsive, I'm counting down the hours until my roommate leaves for 3 weeks in Hawaii tomorrow morning. I feel like my mom must have felt after having spent the day cleaning the house in preparation for company. We kids would arrive home from school and she'd try frantically-- and only somewhat successfully-- to control the whirlwind of destruction that we would leave behind us. I love my roommate but he's sloppy. He seems to treat a messy room or the dirty dishes that he's created as something that someone else will clean up. Now, we all have lapses. As much as I like a perfectly spotless living room and kitchen, I rapidly lose interest when it comes to the bathroom or even my bedroom. Both are most often in high states of disorganization. Living with the kind of roommate I have has also made worn down my resistance to piles of magazines or books on the coffee table or coats left on chairs. But, beginning tomorrow... the loft will be exclusively mine for 3 weeks. And I'm so excited about it being-- and remaining-- clean that I can hardly contain myself. Pretty disturbing, huh? It would be if so many gay men weren't like me. Other than that series of compulsive thoughts... how am I spending my day off? I'm reading urlLink Bernard Lewis' "What Went Wrong?" . It's a remarkable account of how the Arab world fell dramatically from its position of leadership in the pursuit of knowledge 500 years ago... to what he calls a region of "shabby tyrannies" today. The book is about 160 pages so you can finish it in a day, perhaps. But the questions Lewis raises and tries to answer are complex. Lewis is one of the foremost Arab scholars and his understanding of Arab culture-- as well as the depth of his reading of source material-- is impressive. Check it out. My legs are still shaky and uncertain... 4 hours after my leg workout this morning. It's a sign of a good, heavy workout... and portends some sore muscles by tomorrow night. I've written an essay type thing that I'll publish here tomorrow.
It's quiet here at dot-org this weekend... but I'm working on a larger piece that I plan to post here on Monday. There should be a few other ramblings here later tonight and Sunday, too. Mainly today is catch-up for me. The house is empty, which means it will get a massive cleaning tonight and tomorrow. I have about 6 loads of laundry to do... and plenty of time in which to get it done! The downside is I'm car-less... it's with D at his parents. So no gym workouts this weekend, which sucks. I'll do several hundred pushups and situps here today and tomorrow... but there's nothing like pushing the plates to stimulate the endorphins. D and I were in Grand Rapids last night for a work-related event. We stayed overnight at the Hilton and this morning I went downstairs... took one look at the broom closet they call the "fitness center" and trudged back up to bed. Hotel fitness centers suck... almost without exception. I know this to be a fact, but I still always expect to be pleasantly surprised. My work got me a couple passes to a real gym... but alas, no time. When it snows in Grand Rapids, you either hunker down for the lake effect deluge or high-tail it out of there, and we chose to do the latter. I took Monday off-- the University of Michigan, where I work, doesn't have a holiday for MLK day.
If you haven't read urlLink Soblo's final (for now) post ... I encourage you to take a few minutes to do so. What I've come to appreciate about Soblo is his ability to let it all hang out in his writing. His joy and his anguish are there for all to see in his posts. Many of us are from the "put a best face on it" school of expression. This is my specialty. And while different styles fit different people, I like reading Soblo because often, he expresses a sentiment I've not expressed before in my writing... or one I've struggled with expressing. The questions that Soblo is asking in that urlLink final post are questions I bet all of us have asked ourselves after the end of a relationship. But seeing that jumble of thoughts on screen reminded me of my own battles, lost and won, in relationships and those tough questions that have dogged me. Thanks Soblo... take care and come back soon!
Well, whatever it is, it's a lot more fun than doing the same thing at 5am, I can tell you that for sure. Saturday night, Dave and I went to a dinner party hosted by a friend of ours. Nice time, nice people, good food, great wine, good conversation. OK? Well, around 10:30pm, our host offers us a cup of coffee. The wine is gone, so sure, we'll have a cup. He reaches into the cupboard and produces what must be the world's smallest coffee cups. These aren't espresso cups... these are Hobbit coffee cups, I swear. Well, it certainly makes the pot go further. Dave and I each consumed about one and a half cuplets, struggling to get our fingers to fit through the Barbie-sized handle. We return home... watch some TV, talk, answer email, talk some more. At 1:30am, we're off to bed. After about 30 minutes, Dave is the first to give up trying. He crawls out of bed and goes downstairs to write. Then I get up. There's no getting around it... I'm not going to sleep for a while, so I might as well make the best of it. I thought I'd surf by gay.com and see if any of my friends were in the chat room. Nope, not even my friend Brad. His bf works overnights so he's often in the room. Not that night. There were plenty of other guys... some of them rather hot... making suggestions that sounded pretty hot to me. But with my ex in the house, I thought it might be tacky. So I left the chat room and figured I'd update my web site and read a few new weblogs. Five minutes later, I was truly bored. Time check: 4am. Ok... time for bed. I should at least give it another shot. Nothin' doin'. Ten minutes in bed confirms that sleep isn't about to happen-- not even by accident. Already, in the back of my mind, I'm starting to focus in on those cup-ettes of java. I got back up and did another 150 crunches. I figured if I was tired and couldn't sleep, there was no reason why my abs should. I read the New York Times Book Review... even the books I didn't like. I checked in on urlLink soblo to see how he's feeling after recent events. Let's see... any update from urlLink Mike 's weblog? No... not in the 5 minutes since I last checked. It was 6am before I fell asleep. I looked it up: an extreme over-reaction to tiny amounts of caffeine isn't considered justifiable homicide in Michigan. So when I saw our dinner party host last night, I just gave him an extra tight bear hug.
... it's been since I spent a long evening in a coffee shop. But I did last night. I wandered across the street in downtown Ann Arbor from my loft to the coffee shop carrying a backpack full of magazines and books. It would take many times the four hours I spent there to consume the reading material I packed in my bag. But that's always the way it is with me and books... my eyes are bigger than my stomach. I spent the evening with "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers." I read two-thirds of the book, savoring for probably the 11th or 12th time, Tolkien's tale. I don't read a lot of fiction; my mind is literal and history and biography are my favorite pasttimes. But the Lord of the Rings holds a special place in my heart and mind. When I was younger, I read it every summer. I don't have the time to enjoy that pleasure anymore; or maybe it's that I've moved on and can enjoy it less frequently now. In any case, it still gives me a great deal of pleasure to savor my favorite moments of the story. Proust can wait for tomorrow. P. has dropped by the coffee shop to pick up a latte at 11:30pm. He's wearing khaki pants, a tweed jacket and, in an odd twist, a dark green baseball cap. As he sips his latte, I wonder just how much money he has. $50 million? It's quite possible. This town has its share of the rich. There's a restaurant here called Knight's. It's one of those places that everyone knows about; it's so well-known that there's no sign outside... just a carving of a large chess piece. Drop in for lunch and you might find four people sititng at a table, both arms on the surface, drinking coffee, forking a lettuce leaf or picking at a steak sandwich. The net worth of those four could be in the low billions. I don't know why I find that remarkable. One would expect it in New York or Los Angeles. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, it surprised me. There's not much that surprises me about this city... after 5 years living here. But it's home. I still love DC and New York and I hope to live in one or both of those cities someday. Last year, I thought about changes... perhaps changing the city where I live or maybe changing my job. I've opted to make changes in my career in this new year... my hometown won't change. For now, Ann Arbor suits me just fine.
winds down and I look back and wonder how it was that the days went by so quickly. Weeks are busy but they're also a blur. Is there any way to capture and store all this time that's speeding by me? What would I do with it if I could? Would I waste it in the same ways that I waste so much time now? Probably. Too much time in front of the computer and too little time between the pages of a great book or with good friends. I like Friday nights more than any other night of the week, I think. It must be because of the promise of a full weekend ahead... the joy of arriving at the very edge of an extended period of free time. The afternoon when you finish work before a vacation starts is probably the only moment that feels better. It's knowing that there's so much time that spreads out before one like the vast plains of Nebraska. Or for those of you who don't like Nebraska, a majestic range of snowcapped mountains, or something like that. Alright, you get my point. :) The other thing I like more than anything else is a quiet, empty, clean house. When you have a roommate, you often don't have a quiet or empty house. And if you're roommate is like mine, you don't have a clean house, either. Don't get me wrong. I love my roommate. He's a great guy and we've had almost 2 years of enjoying each other's company at close range. But maybe because he's going to be moving out soon... I'm thinking more and more about those little things that bug me about him. All of us who have, or have had, roommates know what I'm talking about. It's the mental check list we keep of the household shortcomings of our roommate. The roommate has his checklist, too... I'm sure of it. I think it stays in the back of your mind until some event calls it to the front. For me, most of the time it's knowing that I'm soon to be living alone again. From that moment of first realization until my roommate steps out the door for the last time, I'm going to be thinking of every unwashed dish, every towel tossed lazily on the floor, every missed opportunity to help in any way with the cleaning of the apartment. But there's always that other side that you're reminded of after the roommate is gone. He couldn't pick up after himself, but dammit he was fun to talk to. And if you're like me, after a couple months, you start to think that the house is too quiet and perhaps another life form would brighten things up. And thus, the cycle begins again. Maybe next time, I'll spring for a gerbil or something. There's something kind of Proustian about this Friday night. Don't ask me why but I think it's going to be a good night to settle into "The Search for Lost Time." Especially because the title so eloquently expresses my quest of late.
I'll have more to say later today... but for now, check out this urlLink article from Newseek about Kim Jong Il and the millions of suffering North Koreans he rules. It's a fascinating piece on a leader whom Madeleine Albright says is isolated, but not uninformed... and he's not a nut, either. Have a good one!
This is one of those days where I think I might write a lot but as I begin I have no idea what it will be about. This is often the case with me... and maybe in some of my posts it's quite apparent to you. :) oh well, I try. Whether or not I'm good at it... I do enjoy writing in this way. It's like conversation with a friend. The best conversations often begin in an aimless way and the meandering along this side street and that leads to topics that provoke new thoughts and insights. I think writing can lead to the same fertile ground. It's a good exercise for me because I'm a total type A kind of guy. I'm usually concentrating only on getting from here to there and what's the most direct way to do it. But taking time to stop and look around and comment on the view often leads to the best nuggets of truth or the most memorable moments. I'm trying to do this when I interview people. Instead of driving the guest like a herd of cattle from point A to point B, I'm trying to be mindful of my agenda... but still be willing to stop along the road and enjoy the view, so to speak. I don't know how else to describe it... to be directed and yet flexible. Anyway, enough about work. It's 9pm as I write this and my mind should be a thousand miles away from work. Yesterday was my second leg day at the gym this year. I hesitate to say this but it was also my second leg day in about the last two years. I used to make fun of guys who had big upper bodies and toothpicks for legs. It's terrible form and not good for your body's balance. And then I stopped doing legs. Mine were big. I could do about a thousand pounds on the leg press. Guys would walk up, look at the plates, and ask if I was on the hockey team. But my dirty secret was that I hated working my legs. It was boring and painful and I didn't see the same kinds of results that I did with my arms or chest. So I stopped. The result? Toothpicks for legs. So, it's time to get serious about my calves and thighs again... and 'fess up to my bad behavior. :) I had a long phone conversation with my friend Todd in San Diego tonight. Today is his 33rd birthday and it was a year ago today that we met on the dance floor of a club in San Diego. We had a few days of really cool times together. I still think to this day that it was some of the most passionate sex I've had in my life. He remains a true friend and I wish him all the best today as he and his friends even now are getting together for dinner at the urlLink Indigo Grill . Some days I think I lose all interest in news. This was one of those days. I picked up the urlLink New York Times and read about urlLink heavy crude in Venezuela and urlLink new research exploring a range of sleep disorders . But the bottom line was that I was more interested in my interview with urlLink Moby and in asking him what he thought of those almost tribal moments of synchronicity that occur on the dance floor when the music is hot and everybody's dancing. Have you ever experienced what I'm talking about? I don't know how to describe it except that it's happened to me twice (without drugs to help it along) and both times I looked around and my impression was that everyone was moving in slow motion. It was quite an amazing experience. Moby was less mystical about it than me, but he knew about those moments of synchronicity that I was talking about. Terence McKenna (may he RIP) used to say that certain rhythm signatures, in combination with psychedelic drugs, could allow one to access something that we might call the urlLink universal consciousness . I don't think I'm that much of a mystic to embrace that idea. But I think there is a certain power to a large group of people dance to house or techno. My friend Matt brought up the idea from gay lit of the universal brotherhood of man that some believe can exist on the dancefloor. Another interesting idea. Ah well... much to occupy the mind on a Tuesday night. Better than urlLink masturbating , right?
... usually don't get me down. (Neither do rainy days.) Especially after a quiet weekend with lots of sleep and good times with friends. Dave and I had a little movie marathon Friday night. We watched two movies Dave has seen... but that I had missed when they came out: American History X and Malcolm X . I think both movies are masterworks-- great performances by Denzel Washington and Ed Norton, in particular. And American History X makes such a strong, yet subtle, argument about hate; it's powerful without being preachy. If you haven't seen it... you must. Here's a little piece of advice: avoid having 7 cups of coffee in a 2-1/2 hour period. It does things to you. I got up Sunday morning around 3:30am and couldn't sleep. I chatted for a while with my friend B and he suggested going out for coffee at urlLink the Fleetwood . We met at 4:30am and by 7am, I had consumed 7 cups of coffee and two glasses of water. That's the thing about diner coffee. It's so damn good. It's bottom of the line Sysco coffee... but I could drink cup after cup-- as long as I was sitting in a diner chatting it up with a friend. So anyway, back to my story. I went home at 7am on a high that approached inebriation. I woke Dave up by jumping on him to tell him I was home... and then I lay down. And lay there until 8:55am before I got up to hit the gym. The shoulder workout wasn't bad but there was no disputing that my high was continuing. Needless to say, I ordered grapefruit juice at urlLink brunch and skipped the java. And while I'm thinking of it, a short tribute to Sunday Brunch. For the most part, I'm Mr. Healthy. But on the weekend, one must make allowances. Sunday is my day to have the big breakfast... three egg omelet, hash browns... or huevos rancheros and rice and beans. Even now, it makes me hungry. hmmm... only 6 days to go. Actually, with my weight currently stalled at 144 lbs... maybe I should have one of those breakfasts more often!
Love 'em, wear 'em... but don't lose 'em!! My Christmas present from D arrived today... the new pair of urlLink Oakley half wire sunglasses . I'm excited for a couple reasons; first of all, I think I look really cool in them; and second because I lost my last pair of Oakleys in September. They were my favorite sunglasses. I bought the pair in San Diego a year ago. And in September when I lost them, I was kind of bummed. There was $150 down the drain. But my new pair more than makes up the difference. The half wires are so cool. Alrighty... enough of the materialism. About certain things, I just can't help it. My PDA, my computer, my cellphone and my sunglasses. Those things are all pretty up to date. My car? Seven years old... and totally due for replacement. But my sunglasses? Brand new. All a matter of priorities, my friend.
So I come into work this morning. It's going to be an easy day. I'm breezing through morning drive on NPR, occasionally wondering why I've been bumbling a few words here and there over the past few days. Note to myself: less coffee before the news. I wander into my office and check the schedule for next week. And there among the usual list of authors, psychologists, historians and scientists to be interviewed next week... is Moby. It's so typical. I asked for an interview with Moby a couple months ago. The staff has been silent about it and I assumed we weren't able to work it out. Well, I made an ass out of me, to paraphrase and let you off the hook. And to continue the typical... there's no heads-up from the staff, to let me know that I should launch into some intense reading and listening over the weekend to prepare. It was the same way with Madeleine Albright. "Todd, we got Albright. Can you talk to her the day after tomorrow?" It was the same with Salman Rushdie. "Todd, we got Rushdie for tomorrow. Can you do it?" "Oh sure... I'll just read a couple of his books tonight to prepare." But enough complaining... I'm talking to Moby and I'm so excited! If you haven't seen it... check out this urlLink New Year's post from urlLink cucalambe . It's exceptional writing... appropriate and heartfelt. While I'm thinking about it... urlLink Chrisonomicon offered a link urlLink earlier this week to a urlLink piece by Phillip Pullman about the responsibility of good storytelling. Among other things... you have to tell the truth, you have to use the language correctly... and you must struggle for clarity. It's an exceptional piece that reminds me somewhat of the classic urlLink Strunk and White . The weekend should be reasonably quiet... just what the doctor ordered after a hectic and expensive holiday. Dave and I have been collecting a few long movies on the Replay box... the new version of Apocalypse Now and Malcolm X. So maybe we'll devote 6-7 hours to those films this weekend. I'm going to spend some quality time with urlLink Proust ... as my 5 year reading continues. There's the workout, which is enjoyable, but a little painful after my short time away from the weights. I'm so skinny when I look in the mirror. Oh there's miles of definition... it just seems like there's so little muscle. It's psychological... and real. But I'll regain the weight I lost... and the lost muscle will come with it.
2003 dawns in Michigan with our first Democratic governor in 12 years preparing to take the oath of office. Jennifer Granholm has the makings of an effective and thoughtful, forceful leader. I've had a few discussions with her already and I'm impressed. We'll see how she does once the honeymoon is over and the excitement over the first female governor in Michigan wears off. So what are your New Year's resolutions ? Or do you make them? I usually haven't. A couple years ago, I decided I would try to achieve 7% bodyfat... which I did. But that's been about the extent of my resolution making. But this year will be different. I think... that I'm going to resolve to be happy in 2003. Pursuing happiness sounds easy... perhaps easier than losing bodyfat. But I think being happy is harder; much harder. That explains why so many people are unhappy. It's not as though I've been unhappy. I've been very happy. I have a job that I love. I make a great deal of money. I have great friends. I have kind of a nice body... which for a gay guy is a good thing. But as I've hinted here, there are aspects of my life about which I'm not happy. So, my goal for 2003 is to make change... to be happier . I've already taken one major step. I'm single again... which I think is best. Nothing bad happened, folks. In fact, if we didn't tell people, I don't think anyone would know it if they saw us together. And more important, we both feel very good about it. It was a step I needed to take and so there's step one. And there's more to come. Maybe I'm lucky. To be happier, I don't have to find a new job or a new apartment or a new city to live in. I have it easy I guess. But no matter our circumstances, I think we have to ask ourselves if we are happy. And if we can't truly answer that question positively, then we need to do some thinking. And then we need to use the tools at our disposal to make change. Change is what life is all about. It's what every day is about. It's what makes our lives better and richer.
Corey Flintoff Unleashes Sonorous, Pleasantly Modulated String Of Obscenities WASHINGTON, DC--- Upon injuring a toe Sunday, Corey Flintoff, newscaster for NPR's All Things Considered, unleashed a string of rich, pleasantly modulated obscenities. "God fucking dammit," Flintoff warmly intoned after dropping a heavy-duty router on his foot while working in his garage. "Stupid fucking cocksucking son of a bitch." Added Flintoff in a lush baritone: "Goddamn motherfucking shit-for-brains. This is NPR." Next-door neighbor Cheryl Thomas, who overheard the tirade, said Flintoff's delivery was so melodic, she was unaware that he was swearing.
mmmm... I'm sitting here typing on the new laptop and admiring the feel of this keyboard... the spring of the keys and the pleasing sound of striking them. I'd forgotten how enjoyable it could be to type and create on a keyboard that feels this good. Is that weird or what? But if you're one of those people who lives on your computer, you have to know what it feels like to be using a keyboard that just isn't "right." My old Dell lapper was a cool little marvel... so thin and light. But with a keyboard that was 95% of full size, things were scrunched slightly and the feel wasn't exactly right so that when I typed I made a lot of mistakes and my typing slowed down. The new notebook is one of those 6 pound jobbies, but the keyboard is full-sized and my oh my those keys feel just right and they sound so pleasant when I strike them. The result? My fingers glide across the surface and I actually look forward to typing because it's such an enjoyable experience. Have I mentioned that I haven't had sex in a long time? :) I was glad to read urlLink Chrisonomicon 's comments about urlLink configuring his new work computer ... because it makes me think there must be many of us for whom a carefully configured laptop is a must. It has to be just so... icons in the proper place and order within the Quick Launch toolbar... Outlook configured for the correct font display... new document template created for Word... Trillian set up so it goes into black and white mode when it's idle. My desk here at home is a mess right now but that doesn't matter. The virtual desktop where I do my real work is clean. Oh and speaking of moving on... and trying hard... which I wasn't (but I was thinking it) check out urlLink Soblo's thoughts on this subject . Especially this... You know, it's tough sometimes. It's tough when you finally get what you want, then realize you didn't really get it, and start looking again, only to realize that the past experience fucked you up so much you aren't ready to look again, no matter how much you want to. And if you ignore that reality, and look anyway, you might find something great, but you're going to be too fucked up to realize it or capitalize on it, and you'll be thrown right back into the training pool, because despite your insistence to the contrary, you're not ready. That's tough too. urlLink Soblo often has a way of putting his finger on it... and above is another example. Theme of the day Few people know this about me, but I have a collection fetish for news theme music packages. I have a large collection from all over the country. The theme on my mind today is Image IX-- familiar to Coloradans from the early 90's and urlLink News 4... Colorado's News Channel .
... we'll briefly join Donald Rumsfeld in ganging up on France. And why not??? They're French!!! I heard that Rumsfeld was asked how he felt going into this war without France. His answer: "Going into a war without France is like deer hunting without an accordian." Here's why... The Complete Military History of France Gallic Wars - Lost. In a war whose ending foreshadows the next 2000 years of French history, France is conquered by of all things, an Italian. Hundred Years War - Mostly lost, saved at last by female schizophrenic who inadvertently creates The First Rule of French Warfare: "France's armies are victorious only when not led by a Frenchman." Italian Wars - Lost. France becomes the first and only country to ever lose two wars when fighting Italians. Wars of Religion - France goes 0-5-4 against the Huguenots. Thirty Years War - France is technically not a participant, but manages to get invaded anyway. Claims a tie on the basis that eventually the other participants started ignoring her. War of Devolution - Tied. Frenchmen take to wearing red flowerpots as chapeaux. The Dutch War - Tied. War of the Augsburg League/King William's War/French and Indian War - Lost, but claimed as a tie. Three ties in a row induces deluded Frog-o-philes the world over to label the period as the height of French military power. War of the Spanish Succession - Lost. The War also gave the French their first taste of a Marlborough, which they have loved every since. American Revolution - In a move that will become quite familiar to future Americans, France claims a win even though the English colonists saw far more action. This is later known as "de Gaulle Syndrome", and leads to the Second Rule of French Warfare: "France only wins when America does most of the fighting." French Revolution - Won, primarily due the fact that the opponent was also French. The Napoleonic Wars - Lost. Temporary victories (remember the First Rule!) due to leadership of a Corsican, who ended up being no match for a British footwear designer. The Franco-Prussian War - Lost. Germany first plays the role of drunk Frat boy to France's Ugly girl home alone on a Saturday night. World War I - Tied and on the way to losing, France is saved by the United States. Thousands of French women find out what it's like to not only sleep with a winner, but one who doesn't call her "Fraulein." Sadly, widespread use of condoms by American forces forestalls any improvement in the French bloodline. World War II - Lost. Conquered French liberated by the United States and Britain just as they finish learning the Horst Wessel Song. War in Indochina - Lost. French forces plead sickness, take to bed with the Dien Bien Flu. Algerian Rebellion - Lost. Loss marks the first defeat of a western army by a Non-Turkic Muslim force since the Crusades, and produces the First Rule of Muslim Warfare: "We can always beat the French." This rule is identical to the First Rules of the Italians, Russians, Germans, English, Dutch, Spanish, Vietnamese and Esquimaux. War on Terrorism - France, keeping in mind its recent history, surrenders to Germans and Muslims just to be safe. Attempt to surrender to the Vietnamese ambassador fails after he takes refuge in a McDonald's. The question for any country silly enough to count on the French should not be "Can we count on the French?", but rather "How long until France collapses?"
another busy schedule of work, reading, work, reading, workouts... etc. Add to that all the necessary preparations for my trip to Iowa this Friday. I'll be there for close to 3 weeks. So, as you can imagine, there's twice as much work to be done this week so that I can be away, plus there are friends I need to see before I leave. The trip is one I take most every year. Make no mistake about it-- it's work. But it's also a kind of vacation. I don't have to study for my regular work, I have more time to spend at the urlLink gym , and I get to stay at a decent urlLink hotel . I usually get a lot of urlLink reading done, and that means it's likely that I will finish Proust while I'm there. My gosh... after all these years, what will I read next? And what will I talk about, since I've talked about Proust at least twice weekly like clockwork for 6 years. By the way... to echo an old and goofy tradition on this site... urlLink Iowa Responds To Terror . I know no one cares... but another week or two goes by and I still have no interest in sex. What the hell is wrong with me?!?!?! :) It must be mourning now that the eminently cool and handsome urlLink Chrisonomicon and his equally handsome urlLink boyfriend are thinking about buying a house together. Speaking of which, in my totally random way, I'm going to travel to Colorado this year to meet those guys. I'm also going to try to meet up with urlLink Jockohomo and the other journal writers whom I so enjoy reading online. Sooner or later, you have to put a face to the pen, right? Keyboard? So where was I? Oh yeah, sex. No interest. No hookups, no sexual relationships... no desire. Since when? Probably last November... this has to be a record! But who cares... this is where I am these days. Besides all that time engaged in sex was doubtless eating into my time reading Proust, right? I'm very happy with my new laptop. The 19 month old Dell Latitude I had used nearly continuously has pretty much outlived its usefulness. It sits at home, the backbone of a home-based desktop... monitor and other extras attached. The new laptop is a screamer.... at least for a while. Pentium 4, 2.8GHz, 512 MB RAM, 32 MB Video, 60GB hard drive, CDRW/DVD. mmmm... tasty! True to form, I spent all weekend getting every little thing perfectly in place in that finicky way that I have with computers and file organization. So today is really the first day of use. A couple readers have asked if I'm about to give up on the journal. I'm not, although the updates have been less than regular over the past couple of weeks. It's the press of work and life, but I expect a real improvement after this week. If you consider more posts to be an improvement.
I cannot figure out why I'm in a slightly sour mood this morning. Maybe because it's still so damn cold outside? Maybe because we missed out on all the snow that so many others got? Maybe because I didn't get enough personal reading accomplished this weekend? Who knows? More likely, it's some dream that I'll never remember or the result of some random event. Speaking of random... Here we go with a couple acres of random thoughts. I did a lot of research yesterday into the genre of " urlLink song-poems ." These are poems written by amateurs and sent to urlLink companies -- which, for a fee, will record them for you. The songs are often quite comical, sometimes pathetic. But, in a way, they're kind of sweet. These people hope to maybe have a hit record-- as impossible as that is. Or they just want to know that someone else has recorded their song. PBS will air a documentary this week about song-poems... called "Off the Charts." Check it out or listen to some of the more wacky song-poems on the weblinks above. I must have read Proust for 4 hours yesterday... riveted by an important plot point. As usual, Proust took somewhere close to a hundred pages just to describe the events at a particular gathering of friends on a winter evening. But that's the beauty of Proust... you are forced to stop and consider. What's wrong with that? It's been at least a few years since I've had such a strong desire to be alone. I often go through periods like this after ending a dating relationship. It's kind of a cleansing for me. It's not that I disconnect from friends; I'm more conscious of my free time and I try to take as much of it as I can for myself. Most of it has been spent with books-- either ones I'm reading for myself or for work. I've shut myself up in my room more... away from my roommate and any other distractions. It must be a kind of coccoon I'm building. I think it's a good thing... it never lasts long and it always seems prepare me for whatever is coming next. And I still have my ex. Each of the ex's -- C and D-- figure prominently in my life. They are speed dial #'s 2 and 3 on my phone. I spend as much time as I can with each of them. And yes... I'm writing this because I got flack from a couple of you for talking about D behaving like an ass when he's drunk! LOL Well, sometimes he does, although it's rare. It doesn't mean I love him any less. In fact, the real problem is that I love him so much. Sometimes, I think the supreme sorrow is loving someone so much and yet knowing there's virtually no way to fashion a workable relationship, given the issues involved. It's not easy... but neither is any aspect of life, I suppose. Except maybe a breakfast of eggs and hash browns on a Sunday. Or maybe a bowl of homemade pasta with a little sauce and a lot of garlic. non sequitor ? Yes... but I'm hungry. Here's a book for you to check out if you're interested in this sort of thing: " urlLink Origins of Existence: How Life Emerged in the Universe ." I read it last week for work. The author is Fred Adams, a physicist at the University of Michigan. He's synthesized new and old data about our universe to fashion a truly understandable and breathtaking history of the formation of our universe and its major features. I think it's a brilliant book. Check it out! Today is the day to order the new notebook PC. My little 4 lb lapper has suffered innumerable injuries... to the point where tape holds it together; the only thing keeping the screen attached is the ribbon that sends the data from the video card to the screen. It's a sad situation. But by early next week, we'll be sitting pretty. The new PC is heavier by a few pounds. But it's a powerhouse. And... it isn't held together by tape.
I'm such a curmudgeon about Valentine's Day. In reality, I'm not. But I like to cultivate that impression among my friends and so I've done that for a long time. But for all my faux-sullen attitude toward the day, I was touched to get one Valentine's Day card... from my roommate's 6yo son. He made me a card with a pop-up Valentine in the center and a Spongebob sticker. You can bet this card is one I'll never throw away. There is one thing I love about Valentine's Day. It's the Single Guys Night Out that I've made something of a tradition. For 4 years now, I've been rounding up single friends and going to our local gay bar for their special Valentine's dinner. Last night was a blast. D and I went as newly single former boyfriends and we invited a couple other friends. It was an immensely enjoyable evening... in part because D didn't drink too much and make an ass of himself. I'm just telling it like it is-- recognizing my own foibles, of course. Ahem, none of which I'll mention here. :) I get these job offer calls from time to time. This week a headhunter called to talk about a "blind search." Major job opportunity... $80k+benefits. I asked him who it was. "I can't say." So I'm applying for a job in a geographical location and at a place that is unknown to me? Maybe this happens all the time in the business world. But it's so foreign to me. What if you applied for a job in a blind search and liked the sound of it and got all excited because it sounded like New York or San Diego... and it turns out to be Minot, ND? I'm not knocking Minot. OK, yes, I am. But geesh... how long in the process can it be before you would have to know? So I said, "Is it M--?" Silence. "How did you know?" "They called me directly last July to offer me the job for $85k." "Oh. Well, now it's $80-100k. You interested?" hmmm... in my industry, it's one of the most significant players. But I'm also working for a significant player now. I don't move for money and I never have. Besides the location sucks-- relatively speaking. Well that's enough career talk. But I think this whole "blind search" thing is wacky. It gives a job this kind of allure that it probably doesn't deserve. It's like "competitive salary." For months now, I've been talking about writing something on the monogamy/open relationship thing. That moment may be coming soon. It's been delayed while I've been trying to think up a grand statement-- the easy answer with the positive resolution that I always like to present when I write here. But as I wrote last summer, life's issues can't always be wrapped in neat packages with a perfect ending and a little moral lesson at the end. So instead of trying to craft that kind of thing, I'm going to present something that is more ragged, uncertain-- but real. Maybe for tomorrow.
since I wrote here last in this journal- the longest time in a few months at least. It's one of those weeks that starts out busy and gets more busy and you're riding that wave of busy-ness and right at the crest you look around at the work you had to accomplish and you wonder at how little it really was. I don't know how else to explain it, except that I was feeling overwhelmed trying to read 6 different books in 4 days. And then Thursday afternoon, I found myself looking ahead to an uneventful Friday and what will be a weekend of various friends-type events, but a quiet weekend nonetheless. Ah well, at least there's the respite. Otherwise I'd be complaining here to no end and then you'd be clicking right about now to go to another page. I passed a major milestone last weekend, in my now 6 year quest to read urlLink "In Search of Lost Time" by Marcel Proust. I finished the second of the three volumes in the set. So that's about 2500 pages done... with only 1100 to go! I've determined that 2003 will be the year that I finish Proust and I intend to make it so. It's not exactly impossible. It's just been slow reading because I've read lots of other books for work and pleasure along the way. And you know what? I have half a mind to go back to page one and start all over again in 2004. But if I have half a mind to do that, then I've lost the other half. There are those big multi-book sets that are so tempting. I own the three volume set of urlLink "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" and the 11-volume set of the infinished history of the world by urlLink Will and Ariel Durant . They look so good on the shelf... a library brimming with history... a home to words and stories about the past. I'm all about that. But I've owned the Durant set for 12 years and the Decline and Fall for probably 7 years and both remain unread. But hope springs eternal. Maybe finishing Proust will give me the burst of energy and gumption to make these other dreams a reality. I've gained 5 pounds in the last 5 weeks. And this is another milestone for me. It's been close to 2 years since I weighed 150 lbs. I fretted about whether I'd be able to do this and keep the muscle definition that I'd come to enjoy looking at on my frame. But almost all it remains after the assault of additional calories and heavy workouts of the past few weeks. I'm pleased with how I look so I'll give myself a couple of months to gain another 5 pounds and see how I like myself then. Dave returns from Hawaii tomorrow after about 2.5 weeks of playing football in the sun and watching sunsets and writing on the beach. The damage? We'll let's tally it up: one pair of Oakley sunglasses lost; one favorite pair of shorts lost (hmmm... he's got some explaining to do on that count); one wireless phone destroyed after unexpected immersion in seawater; and, one digital voice recorder ruined-- yes, seawater. Thank goodness he's not staying any longer. He's run out of valuables. I've had this past two weeks to consider the prospect of dating ... and my gosh it sucks. It seems the height of unfair that a guy like me who hates to date should be unsuccessful in finding lasting love and thus be forced to commit the very act which he despises most. I've tried to figure out why I hate it so much and I think that beyond the awkwardness of going out to coffee or dinner with someone you don't know very well, it's just this idea that this is wrong. My last boyfriend and I were friends first and roommates and so we already had become practically best friends by the time we considered dating that we didn't have to have that awkward "what do you like to do in your spare time?" conversation. By contrast, Dave and I had the opposite problem. After living together for so long, we knew most everything about each other. We knew hobbies, each other's work schedule, little eccentricities, what each other looked like naked-- those basic kinds of roommate things. Dating for us was like being roommates except we were sleeping in the same bed and having sex. There was a lack of mystery about each other... and if you think about it, that's at least half the allure of dating. The guy is handsome and maybe hot and you like his personality. But there's also this mystery. What's he like naked? Is he good in bed? Is he a great cuddler? Can he cook? Dating is the discovery of those secrets. It's not a bad thing if you know most of the answers already, but it takes a small measure of the fun out of it. I think if I ever start dating a roommate again I'm going to make him move out. If the relationship goes well, he can move back in after a year or so... but otherwise, OUT. :) I've been trying to put my finger on it for the last couple of months and at last I know what it is. As I sit here at Sweetwaters sipping my vanilla tea and looking out at people walking down the sidewalks and at my loft across the street... I realize, I'm finished here . I'm done with Ann Arbor, Michigan. It doesn't mean I'm better than this city, or that I've experienced everything here that there is to experience... it just means that I'm done here. I can feel it. Have you ever felt that before about where you lived or maybe where you worked? It's not like you moved the next day or changed jobs two days later. It might take two years... but I'm done here. It won't be like I'm marking time. I like it here a lot... the shops, the restaurants, the people, all my friends. But within a couple of years, I'm willing to bet that I'll be somewhere else. Maybe someplace warm? Probably not. My heart calls the east coast home. So... DC? NYC? hmmm... I'm going to get another cup of vanilla tea and think about that one.

... an anonymous email from one of those readers who has arrived at a number of conclusions about me today after reading my weblog for months... nearly every one of which is incorrect. I get one email like this about every 12-15 months. Those of you who write weblogs or some other form of public writing or speak or whatever must have experienced this before. It amazes me... and then I think "am I so incapable of expressing how I feel that I'm misleading everyone?" The next thing that occurs to me is that I should just stop writing. But that's dumb. I love doing this. I love the performance and the practice of writing... even though there are many days where I'm dissatisfied with the end result. The reader thinks I'm unhappy with every aspect of my life... but as those of you who are my friends or who read this know... it's not true. But I've remembered someone telling me that when people complain it's often more about their life and their problems then yours. In this case, yes. So... I'll go on writing and assume that those who don't like me or my writing will move on to other things. Seriously though, For the past 5 years, I've used this weblog as a place to be more dark... because I'm generally perceived as Mr. Optimistic. One of my closest friends called me a little kid the other day as I was enthusing about one thing or another. I've discovered I have to have a space where I can be less positive and write in a darker manner. I've been trying to do this more and more in recent months because I think life and the questions it raises are more open-ended and uncertain than I'm usually willing to concede. I believe in happy endings because I've always had them in life. But as I get older I'm becoming aware that the world for many is not a happy place at all... and even for me it's a more complicated place than I naively imagined it to be. However, now I'm free to admit. There is one aspect of my life about which I'm very unhappy: my neck. The stiffness of a few months ago has turned into chronic pain and a relatively small range of motion. This is probably caused by something stupid I've done in my workout. But working out also alleviates the pain and makes my neck more flexible. I think I'll try massage first and if I can't make that work... I might have to make my first trip to the chiropractor. This morning, I mentioned that I was looking for some hints on Twin Cities entertainment, lifestyle,etc. I got a few suggestions and thanks for those. But I led several people to believe I'm moving. I'm not. I'm going to be in the Twins for two-- count them, two-- days next month. My fault... I wanted to know more about the neighborhoods and downtown living and that set some of you off in the wrong direction. I'm playing dog-sitter for a few days... a beautiful 2 year old Rottweiler. I never had a dog when I was growing up. And when I was young, I was afraid of them because I didn't understand them. Over the years, I've grown to love them. And dammit... I'm going to get one and soon! :) Dave likes dogs but only if they're outside. We live downtown so outside isn't going to happen. Now Dave and I are both stubborn people. Oddly enough, I think it's why we're such great friends. So we have something of a stalemate going... we're not going to have a dog inside (Dave) but we're also not going to move (Todd). Something has to give. I assume it will be Dave. He assumes it will be me. I think we should compromise and get a houseboy instead!!
I have a news bulletin to broadcast: Weekends Are Too Short . I'm going to call CNN and beg them to dispatch Aaron Brown to sigh, stare wistfully into the distance, or weep openly about this tragic story. I want live reports on videophone from the coffee shop where I didn't get to hang out this weekend because I was too busy with other things. Oh yeah, and I also probably didn't manage my time well. But having complained, I can now reveal that I had an array of fun activities to take up my time this weekend. There was a major conference on urlLink Gay Shame at the University of Michigan. I missed most of it because of other commitments. But my friend Matt and I caught a seminar on "The Shame of Gay History" on Saturday afternoon. The scholars questioned the assumption that all of gay life before Stonewall was about shame and repression... and that life after Stonewall has been an open expression of pride and progress toward gay acceptance. Nothing is ever that easy, and it was great to get perspectives from the likes of urlLink George Chauncey and Deborah Gould . Sunday was a great big gob of laziness... hours with the Sunday New York Times, brunch at the gay bar, hanging out with the roommate and ending the day with Six Feet Under. Dave and I also went to dinner with a lesbian friend of ours who has just started dating. She brought along her date who has the same first name as her's. Aside form the slight confusion, it was cool to see their slightly awkward but still genuine affection. Ah, young love. Hey you Twin Cities readers ... how about some recommendations on cool things to do, places to live, coffee spots for hanging out... gyms to work out, attractions, etc. I'm going to be in the land of Ten Thousand Lakes for a few days next month. The friend I referred to in my piece on Saturday wrote me an email yesterday, assuring me he still believes the war is entirely about oil. I didn't ask him if he still thinks I'm a warmonger. And I probably won't. He doesn't usually read my weblog... and maybe it's easier for him to think I'm pro-war than to actually think about the issues that many of us who don't like this war are trying to juggle.
My friend Chris, who is working on his PhD at American University, sent me this. He's studied the Clinton and Bush foreign policies in great detail. I think you’re right on about the left's critique of those of us who are in support (albeit tacit support) of the current campaign in Iraq. I haven't spent much time talking about my feelings on the matter, in part, because of what I do. I'm taking this opportunity to really observe, and it’s difficult to do that if you share your views with the people you're talking to. I believe that we have made what could turn into a monumental mistake in this war. That being said, allow me to circle back a bit. I think that Saddam must go, and that the only way this can be accomplished is through forcible removal. However, I believe that a little more time at the UN (let's just call it a more robust diplomatic effort) could have allowed us to do so with broader international support. This is not something to be dismissed. For many years, scholars in the discipline have been speculating about an eventual backlash to American hegemony. This was largely averted, in my opinion, by the foreign policy of the Clinton administration. We seem to forget that "expansion and enlargement," the central thrust of the Clinton era (coined by William Christopher) constituted a concerted effort to encourage the development of democratic institutions and market economies throughout the world. I find it interesting that the new Bush National Security Strategy (a document that I have spent hours upon hours on) takes up these notions of expansion and enlargement. Unfortunately, they do so in an overtly unilateralist tone. The clear implication of the Bush posture, unlike the Clinton policy, is that we are now encouraging other nations, including our allies, to balance against us. Thus, facilitating a backlash. What I am trying to articulate it that the Bush National Security Strategy is not so much bold in the ends it is trying to achieve, but in the mechanism it chooses to pursue to foster the growth of democracies and free markets. This position will make it increasingly difficult for the US facilitate the achievement of its desires because it may foster open hostility. Our allies may support these desired ends, but it will become much more difficult for them to be on board with our means of accomplishing them. In the end, they will become obstructionist because we give them no other choice (a la, the French).
I've sat on this piece for 3 days... wondering whether I should publish or not. Publishing wins out... even though I decided not to finish the post. We're a week into war now... and some of my friends are growing more testy with me whenever we talk about the war. I feel like I'm caught in the middle... between my pro-war and anti-war friends. Both groups expect loyalty to their ideas... both express patriotic and thoughtful arguments... and both seem to dislike anyone who won't choose a side. The pro-war people are acting like they have the moral high ground. They deliver what has to be one of the longest-lasting and dumbest arguments I've heard: if you don't support the war, you're not a true American. When I hear a variation of that, I don't know whether to laugh at them or slap them upside the head. But here's the thing: people on the left are doing the same damn thing. If you aren't willing to condemn all wars, past, present and future, if you aren't willing to weep for peace, lie down on the ground for peace, protest violently for peace-- now wait a minute, what the hell is that about? One of my friends who is opposed to war of any kind repeatedly calls me a "warmonger" with a faint smirk. It leaves me wondering if he is trying to call me out for fun or if he really thinks I am one. In fact, it's my liberal friends who have become the most shrill and caustic about this. And that bothers me because I'm a liberal person. To me, being liberal is more about consuming information and recognizing complexity in the world than it is about grabbing any old hardline leftist position and holding on for dear life. War has turned some of my friends into simpletons. These normally shrewd people suddenly lost it. And I know when it happened-- last Tuesday. At lunch last Tuesday, a particularly thoughtful friend blurted out how this war was all about oil. Dave and I looked at him. He didn't have any of the other symptoms of SARS. Where did the kindergarten-level analysis come from? He said it in a burst of frustration and anger. And I can understand that. We've watched President Bush trash Kyoto and the War Crimes Tribunal and then turn around and try sledgehammer diplomacy to build a coalition for a war about which most countries are deeply ambivalent. No wonder we're all frustrated. But that doesn't give any of us liberals the excuse to spout a bunch of crap. When you question someone spouting this rhetoric they look at you wide-eyed... you seem human. But if you don't follow the peaceniks down the yellow brick road, then you're not one of the "concerned" or enlightened ones. As far as I'm concerned, that's no better than the neanderthal right-wing mouthbreathers on Fox News: "Saddam evil must blow up." Frankly, I find the Bush doctrine of pre-emption intriguing; first of all, it's an incredibly proactive stance-- an heir to the Monroe Doctrine, yes, but something the likes of which we've not seen before. I think it's breathtaking and audacious. I also think it's an incredibly dangerous position to take-- for a number of reasons. First of all, if you read history, there are plenty of precedents for breaking with the pack and going it alone. But never before has a democratic nation set out to pursue a strategy with such gusto. Doing it in the service of expanding democracy might be a laudable cause, but no pursuits are that pure. And democracy doesn't grow like grass; it's a really fussy orchid that grows with the right amount of food and water, or else dies. The United Nations has often been a bloated, bureaucratic nightmare... a debating society where there was plenty of hot air and little of substance. But the fact remains that the UN has a reserve of legitimacy and President Bush's impatience with it, and his scorn for it, has inflicted damage on the institution. Now, I do believe that in the long-term, Saddam poses a more disturbing threat to the region than many realize-- less so to us than to the stability of the Mideast. But I also think that we pose a threat to the region's long-term stability... if we mess up the rebuilding of Iraq... or if we don't put enough pressure on Israel and the Palestinians to make peace. I don't think I should go on any further. None of us likes war and all of us are probably upset about at least some aspects of war. And I didn't start this journal so that I could go on and on about war.
My friend Rick sends this dispatch from India... There really are cows, presumably sacred, wandering loose in Calcutta. Lots of them. I saw the first one on the lawn as I left the airport, and many more grazing in the median or nosing through trash along the road. They were scattered on the vast grassy field across from the white marble Victoria Memorial Hall, where kids played cricket and behaved as though the cows were invisible. The burgers on the room service menu at the Taj Bengal Hotel are chicken burgers. (I also saw a few wandering horses and goats here and there, but have been unable to establish details of the relevant theology.) I expected the airport to look like a tumbledown bus station and it did; I didn't expect it to be so empty. The city may have 13 million people, but most of them probably don't fly. After collecting my luggage and counting out 180 rupees for a "prepaid taxi," I walked out front and got the first one in line. And what a line it was--dozens of identical yellow "Ambassador Classic" cars, made by Hindustan Motors, most of them ancient and badly used and jacked up unnaturally high off the ground as though raising their skirts for floods. Many eager hands helped load the luggage for tips. My offer of Malaysian coins earned me murderous glances. When I got in the back seat, the roof was too low, and I had to slouch down for the duration. The driver started up the diesel engine, not without some difficulty and finesse with the choke, and we lurched off toward the city trailing blue smoke and sounding like a vintage John Deere tractor. Heat and dust blasted in through the open windows. There's not much of a main road between the airport and the city to the south. There is a sort of divided highway, but it's so choked with rickshaws and pedestrians and bicycles and careening taxis, and pretty narrow to begin with, that it looks more like the side streets it soon turns into. "Short cut," the driver announced. We bounced past sprawling slums of leaning shacks with woven wicker walls, teeming with people, spilling into the streets. Behind them rose giant billboards with bright pictures of an unattainable life, mocking the residents below with empty promises of cell phones, video games, and solid investment portfolios. The driver maneuvered the car mostly with his horn (sometimes known in Cairo as "the Egyptian brake pedal," I've just learned) and when we reached maximum cruising speed of about 35, I thought from the racket that the engine would fly apart. Over a small bridge and further into the city, the slums were ramshackle brick and tile roofs patched with tarps, and more crowds were everywhere--women in colorful saris, bearded men, children of all ages, sacred cows--all standing around eating or talking or doing nothing, enjoying the (relative) cool of the approaching evening. It could have passed for Managua in 1970, except for the cattle. It's hot and crowded, it's dusty and smoggy, and much of it smells bad. But no one who lives here seems to notice. It is impossible to ride through Calcutta indifferently. It's an assault on the senses--particularly the sense of sight. There is just so much going on. Drivers slalom through complex intersections using every tool at their command but the brake. The constant near-collisions with buses and bicycles and ancient lumbering trolleys are breathtaking. The driver squeezes up next to another car in an impossibly narrow lane, then honks and gestures for the other to get out of the way. Neither gives up, and both push their cause beyond all reason, but if you wait long enough, one will be cut off by a line of standing traffic, or a bus stopped for no reason crosswise in the street. Pedestrians stroll into five lanes of speeding vehicles with the aplomb of a matador executing a flawless veronica.. It's the only way to cross the street. They have no choice, except to grow old and die on the side of the street where they were born. Apart from the traffic, countless little frozen sidewalk scenes blur past. People standing in shadowy doorways of little shops, talking. A basket of eggs on display, suspended in a window. A bearded old man sitting crosslegged and splashing water on himself from a bucket. Young boys throwing a ball against a cement wall, mimicking the elaborate contortions of a professional cricket bowler. Under a scrawny tree, a young man sitting in a chair, a towel snugged around his neck, getting a haircut from a barber whose shop is nothing more than a scrap of shade and a square meter of sidewalk. The natives move slowly, with the practiced savvy of people who know how to get through the day in a torrid climate. Early this afternoon I grabbed a taxi and headed for the Oberoi Grand Hotel across town. As a cool oasis of elegance in a clamorous city, it is to Calcutta what Raffles is to Singapore. At the white gates, guards screen out the wrong sort of people--that is, poor Indians. The fare was 31 rupees and I gave the driver a 50 rupee bill, which he pocketed and waited for me to get out. With the outrageous 66% tip, the entire cost soared to slightly more than a dollar. I didn't begrudge him the windfall. The Oberoi lobby is a gentlemen's refuge of marble floors and overstuffed sofas for hushed business conversations, and beveled glass doors surround tropical gardens and a pool. There are dark paneled lounges and display cases of Indian artifacts, and several polished steps lead up to each set of elevators, giving them the grand appearance of the entry to the City of Oz. I mean, really...they're just elevators. But the place is possessed by colonial ghosts sipping gin and tonics after the cricket match, confident that the sun can never set on the British Empire. Outside the gates it's a different story. I walked out to the sidewalk and was swept down the block in a rip tide of shoppers and merchants. A woman with a half-naked baby (but incongruously well dressed herself) battened on me like a tick on a hound dog, begging for a handout. Knowing that one coin would spark a feeding frenzy--and not having any coins, actually--I launched myself through the crowd. She remained effortlessly at my elbow, murmuring insistently. Remembering the skill of the taxi driver, I cruised quickly ahead and brushed past a group of men standing on my right, thinking she'd have to shear off at the last moment. Magically, she was still there, a still small voice in the turbulent crowd. Did her feet ever touch the ground? "Go, go,go," I said, and waved her away. "Go, go, go," she echoed, and didn't miss a step. I walked another two blocks before a doomed young American couple approached me, and as they walked past, the woman turned and locked onto them with her rapscallion's radar and vanished like a shade. I turned around to confirm her departure and strolled into the waiting arms of a friendly merchant. "Hello," he said with a gap-toothed smile. "Are you German? That is my store." He indicated a streaked window where a few bolts of sun-bleached cloth and a lot of trinkets were on display. "Emporium!" he added, like Mohamed al-Fayed at the gleaming front door of Harrods. Mercifully, I was out of time. Dominique Lapierre dubbed Calcutta 'The City of Joy,' while Rudyard Kipling called it 'The City of the Dreadful Night." It probably depends which side of the Oberoi gate you're on. Most of Calcutta is undeniably on the outside. At superficial first glance, which unfortunately is all I have time for, it strikes me as a mass of people who have become very good at living in a fulminating anthill of a city. Like the people crossing the street at great peril to life and limb, they have no choice.
From urlLink The Guardian ... a funny piece that I'm shamelessly reprinting without permission; "George Bush" addresses the troops in Tampa. See how cleverly the wires are disguised. Yesterday President George Bush made his first public appearance since the start of the war, speaking to service personnel at the MacDill airforce base in Tampa in an obvious bid to reassure Americans and boost the morale of the armed forces. But how do we know this is the real George Bush? Later in the day a man who looked and sounded like Mr Bush appeared alongside Tony Blair at Camp David, leaving intelligence experts to ponder whether a lookalike had been used, and whether the same lookalike had been deployed on both occasions. It has long been suspected that Mr Bush employs a string of lookalikes for difficult or dangerous speaking engagements, some of whom may have had their ears specially enlarged for the task. Most of those who regularly monitor Mr Bush's speech patterns believe that it was the genuine article who spoke at Central Command HQ in Florida yesterday, pointing to a characteristic tendency toward quasi-biblical phrasing - "There will be a day of reckoning for the Iraqi regime, and that day is drawing in near" - and an almost total absence of words of more than three syllables. Other experts disagree, pointing out that these consistencies originate with speech writers rather then the president himself, and that Bush's main vocal technique - the bewildered pause - is only too easy to imitate. Several observers noted that the president's eyes seemed too close together; others believed them to be too far apart (when viewed on a 21in TV screen, you shouldn't be able to fit a pound coin between them, according to one rule of thumb). It is telling, they say, that Mr Bush made his first appearance in front of combat service personnel, none of whom are likely to have known him closely during his days with the Texas National Guard. So if it's not him, who is it? Some experts suspect that this might be a heretofore unknown Bush brother, a family sleeper who has been groomed to step in at times of crisis, or even George Bush Sr on his first outing following a recent toupee fitting and a course of Botox injections. Yesterday's appearance has also given fresh credence to outlandish claims that Mr Bush's public outings have long been undertaken by an animatronic puppet especially built for Dick Cheney in the mid-1990s. If this is true, then where is the real George Bush? Has he been killed or kidnapped, or is he just sitting at home talking back to the television? It has been pointed out by several observers that Tony Blair, who has become close to Mr Bush over the course of many private meetings, would never be fooled by any sort of stand-in. It remains a distinct possibility, however, that Mr Blair has only ever met a particular lookalike, perhaps one who has been specially trained to appear committed to peace and international stability. For now, Bush-watchers are refusing to say publicly whether or not this is the real president of the United States or a clever, surgically-altered lookalike. Privately, however, they have carefully observed this confused-looking man, with his stiff, empty gestures and false gravitas. They have noted his peculiar phrasing, which gives little indication that he understands the content of what he is saying. They have examined his every doomsday platitude, scrutinised his baffled expression and noted that he seems uncomfortable and completely lost whenever the teleprompter is switched off. And they have concluded that it must really be him.
The latest from my globe-trotting friend, Rick-- En route from Seoul via Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. I had almost forgotten how little they fancy air conditioning here, but I remembered right away when I walked into a wall of 96-degree heat at the jetway. There are other differences too, especially the cacophony of the terminal and glitter of duty-free shops. Seoul is far more formal and reserved in its haute extortionaire separation of traveler from wallet, and Hong Kong was very quiet, maybe gripped by fear of the super-pneumonia that's seeping out of South China. I saw a couple of elderly men wearing surgical masks in the terminal, as people sometimes do back in Seoul because of air pollution only they can detect. Maybe it's worse in the summer, when I haven't been there. I couldn't fault the old Chinese gents for trying to protect themselves, until I started to wonder if they HAD the disease, and were trying to board my flight like a couple of stowaway monsters from "Alien." But they disappeared, bound for some other flight or snatched by the flu police, so I forgot about them and turned to other annoyances. Like my flight. I had a bad feeling, or at least a bemused one, when I boarded in Seoul and was handed a new toothbrush (How long is this flight again??) and a hideously designed postcard warning of a ban on smuggling meat products in your luggage. What about a floral necklace and a copy of the South China Post instead? Then I settled into my seat, way back in 66D. Royal Thai Airlines is a lovely carrier with pretty purple planes. But it seems designed for the average Thai traveler; which is to say, Ken and Barbie. Still, the two seats inboard from me were empty for now, and I squished myself in for the run down to Hong Kong. Things seemed fine until more passengers arrived, including a group of maybe 15 swarthy men of indeterminate nationality who sat all around me and began to talk, loudly and incessantly, all at once. I just couldn't put my finger on their origin, but it wasn't Asian--maybe Turkish?. When they spoke to the flight crew it was in English, not Thai, but their own language among themselves was grating and unlovely, with a staccato cadence not unlike the sound of a handful of dried beans flung against the side of a resonant sheetmetal shed. They all had big, basso-profundo voices, and they managed to keep talking even through lunch. I was in a bad mood, I admit it, after several days of very tough meetings and facing another long day of travel. In no time at all, I hated these guys. I became convinced they were purposely aggravating me. I couldn't concentrate on my book, and couldn't make my headphones work to drown them out. (The controls are also made for tiny Thai fingers, and they are impossible to reach if you're not traveling with a handy seven-year-old.) But given the present state of world affairs, this is not a good time to be a cranky American, or an ugly one. I kept my irritation to myself. To help me take my mind off the noise, a diminuitive Korean woman in front of me suddenly reclined her seat, thrusting the edge of my hardbound copy of "Holidays in Hell" into my sternum. Tres ironic. She reprised this trick several times in the next five hours, leaving me bruised and battered from an abusive relationship with P.J. O'Rourke... They really loaded up the plane leaving Hong Kong, making a perfectly good Boeing 777 feel like a perambulator stuffed with writhing midgets. The two seats beside me went to two mustachioed Eastern European men. The air around them fairly shimmered with a reeking combination of cheap whiskey, vile Commie tobacco, and neglected hygiene. They wedged themselves into the seats, clamped headphones over their bad haircuts and turned the music up to ear-bleed level. Their presence for the rest of the flight was unremarkable, except when they occasionally shifted in their seats, releasing another little wave of eye-watering Eau de Grozny. And at alternate times, I detected a tiny refreshing whiff of cleaner scent now and then, like old-fashioned Air Wick room deodorizer. I thought a sympathetic crew might be fumigating the cabin atmosphere, but it was probably just the bathroom door opening. Here at Gates 1-7, buses are lined up at glass doors just behind the counters; whether taking passengers to another lounge or right to the plane I cannot tell. What's a little disturbing is that fact that I came through here just three months ago, and I have no memory of this Dulles-like system. Maybe it was late at night and I was tired. I can only conclude that it's not good for the brain for a person to roll through so many countries in such a short time--or that some airports just aren't worth remembering. I was more at home at Incheon this time, and that's more important, because I didn't get taken to the cleaners a second time by the unscrupulous taxi drivers. Still, I worry a little about this selective memory loss, since among people Our Age it could signal the beginning of a steep dive into senility. In Korea, older people seem to reach a point in life where they begin strolling, slowly, hunched forward with their fingers locked together behind their backs, whenever they go out in public. I don't know at what age that strikes the unsuspecting AARP bait, but--like the American phenomenon of Bermunda shorts with black dress socks and wingtips--I fear it could blindside me at any time. I'm not ready. It must be almost time to board the bus. Besides, the beeeeeep of the metal detectors, detecting metal, is driving me nuts. Every passenger must be packing a howitzer today. But no! A check around the darkened counter revealed that the gate had been changed. For my convenience, the flight has also been delayed. It's gonna be a late night at Kuala Lumpur International tonight.
A nice day today... spent in many pursuits. First there was the talk Dave and I gave on the role of faith in the lives of gays and lesbians. It was at a urlLink Presbyterian church in Ann Arbor. About 100 people came to the talk and we spent most of the time answering questions-- quite thoughtful ones, too. It was a great time, and I was encouraged to see people of faith so wanting to engage this issue in a positive way. Then it was a 2 hour brunch at the local urlLink gay bar with ministers from the church and other parishioners. My faith, lapsed as it is, is important to me... so I loved the engaging discussion about LGBT issues, ordination of women, and the many other topics that floated around the tables. Dave and I drove to Flint afterward to see his 6 year old son and a few of the extended family. We watched the war, talked about it, read about it... and then came back home. My favorite tv channel is changing names tomorrow. Discovery Civilization will become urlLink Discovery Times Channel ... with some cool new shows and current events type stuff-- not to mention more David Frost interviews. It's a news junkie's dream-- or at least it is, potentially. Speaking of TV, I've had about all I can take of TV coverage of the war. The networks are either giving us endless play-by-play with no thoughtful analysis (CNN, MSNBC) or serving up plates of sugary patriotism (FOX). Who is doing coverage well, in my opinion? Domestically, Peter Jennings at ABC News. He's smart, projects a sense of serenity and control at the anchor desk that's unmatched... and he's thoughtful enough to look for deeper answers than the superficial crap we're being offered elsewhere. For a few days, BBC America has been offering us urlLink BBC World , which lacks the 65 camera positions to show us exploding buildings in Baghdad. But it has more correspondents than anyone else and its global heft as a news gathering organization is unrivalled. We can get urlLink BBC on the Internet, but it's a shame that we can't get total access to BBC World. urlLink NPR News is my network, but I think they deserve credit for a high quality of reporting and analysis, overall. If you want to see how much CNN dumbs down its coverage for us... check out urlLink CNN International . Many Americans get it on their CNNfn channel. You would be surprised at the level of reporting skill, nuance, the high degree of information and the lack of hype on the international version of CNN, compared to its American cousin. There's much more coverage of protests on CNN International, too. Thank goodness for the urlLink New York Times and the urlLink Washington Post . urlLink Puck's mix CD now occupies position 2 in urlLink my new car's 6-CD changer.
I got a new car today. I've been talking about it for longer then a year, but today I finally drove off the lot with a new Ford Escape. It's black and cool and stuff-- my first SUV... and the first time I'll be driving something where I'm not about 6 inches off the ground. After more than 7 years in the ground-hugging Acura Integra, I'm ready to see where I'm going in the forest of SUV's on the highway. Dave is training me to call it a "truck" and not a "car." I'm not getting this right very often, but I'm working on it. Dave and I speak at a church tomorrow about the place of faith in the life of a gay man. It should be a good discussion. So many gays, lesbians and bisexuals who have a spiritual life feel forced to give it up because of the anti-gay attitudes of many in organized religions. I think we're lesser for it-- at least those of us who seek that kind of a life. So it will be a good chance to talk to straight people about the importance of reaching out to the LGBT community and to those who are among them. There are likely to be some people who are uncomfortable with gays and lesbians there... but I think most of the audience will be sympathetic to at least the general idea that LGBT individuals have something to contribute to the church. Typo of the Week: Unconventional War The New York Times 3/20/03: [Bush argued] "that topping the Iraqi government was 'a vital part' of a broader war against terrorism."
urlLink A brilliant piece from The Washington Post shows that, apparently, Saddam Hussein was in a compound as it was attacked by US bombs and cruise missiles last night. There is some indication that Saddam might have been injured. And a woman who has passed a polygraph test claiming to have been Saddam's mistress-- and who has identified his doubles on several occasions, says the man delivering the speech in last night's broadcast on Iraqi television was not Saddam Hussein.
As the first attacks begin... our thoughts extend to all the service women and men who are putting themselves in harm's way. And also for innocent individuals who might be caught in the line of fire.
Busy days... but I thought I'd drop off a quick note to say hi and wish all of you well. I got back from Des Moines yesterday and said hello to my own place and my own bed. And my own roommate whom I haven't seen for a month. It's been the longest I've been away from him since we met and it's seemed unbearable at times. We spent most of the day hanging out, talking about boyfriends, collaborations, flings, love, apartments, one-night stands, life and pictures on the wall. I've missed my friends, no doubt about it. urlLink Puck sent a mix CD of cool tunes and it's been my soundtrack all evening. I pulled out my videotapes of the First Gulf War... or shall we call it GW1? (You can also use "Operation Ass Whooping" or "Saddam-Smasher" or "Eat This" for the second reference.) For some strange reason, I video-ed about 50 hours of CNN and other coverage in 1991... beginning with the very moment of CNN's switch to Baghdad for the first words of Bernard Shaw... "Something's happening." Dave and I watched clips for about 15 minutes. The parallels are amazing... even though we were looking at a thinner Wolf Blitzer from 12 years ago. It's hard not to think "here we go again." You all know my preference for diplomacy... but with war about to happen, let's hope for all involved that it's brief and with as little loss of life as possible. I installed urlLink Microsoft Office 11 Beta 2 this afternoon and now I'm typing away in the new colorful, cleartype environment of the new Office. The urlLink current Mac version looks exactly urlLink 10.3 times hotter ... but I'm loving the many little improvements over Office XP. And since nearly all of my life occurs within the confines of Outlook and Word, the new look is a change of pace. The Evil Empire has also released the beta of its new urlLink One Note program.
urlLink The New York Times reports that Germans are breaking a long-held taboo and talking about their own suffering in the Second World War. The newspaper reports there have been an endless string of documentaries on German television about the Allied bombing campaigns of the war... and books about the bombing of Dresden and other related subjects. In an interesting way, this remembrance of the horror of war is at least part of the reason behind the German opposition to war in Iraq. For decades, Germans have been largely prevented from talking about their own suffering during World War Two. Let's consider a few facts: the allies dumped 80 million bombs on Germany during the war. In the firebombing of Dresden on February 13, 1945... about 35,000 people died. On March 12, 1945, the American Eighth Air Force attacked Swinemunde. The city was packed with refugees fleeing the Soviets. The American attack resulted in the loss of 23,000 lives. Right wing Germans have talked about their suffering for a long time. The difference now is that leftist writers are also writing about it. One writer has used words like "death by gassing" and "crematoria" to describe the effects of the firebombing on civilians-- words that would normally be reserved for the Holocaust. I think this story is sadly illustrative of the complexity of history and the destructive nature of war. I don't think any of us will consider massacres along the lines of the incidents I just described on the same level as genocide. The systematic destruction of the Jews in German concentration camps was and remains truly horrifying. Historical evidence has shown that Hitler carried out his plan to annihilate the Jews in an environment where thousands, maybe millions of Germans, were aware of it. Those same histories show us that ordinary people did little or nothing to stop it. It's for this reason that the culpability for the deaths of six million Jews in the Holocaust is shared by Hitler and the German people. This is true. There's another thing that many historians tell us. Those bombing campaigns in Germany were part of a clear military strategy to demoralize the German people na dmake it possible for Allied troops to enter the country with minimal resistance. I can also accept this as true. But history is a web of complexity-- complexity within complexity. So neither of those facts fully accounts for what happened. Are the thousands of poor, starving women and children-- who suffered endlessly because of Hitler and the war he started, who never knew about Hitler's Holocaust, is their extermination in the "crematoria" of the fires of Dresden justified? Decades later, can the German people be allowed to recognize this suffering without being accused of anti-semitism? Yes they can, but within limits. In the NY Times article, one survivor of the Dresden firebombing said that while he thinks the wholesale destruction of his city by the Allies was a criminal act, he's worried that Germans "will be swept into a mood of victimization." Such a mood would give ultra-right-wing forces in Germany the freedom to spread their atavistic, anti-semitic rhetoric more forcefully. What will happen in Iraq? Will thousands of civilians... women, children... who suffered under Saddam's reign of terror be killed in the Allied attack? Will this produce a sense of victimization and the seeds of a new hatred of America after the war? Will it lead to a far worse and more devastating encounter years from now? We can reduce the level of civilian destruction but we cannot eliminate it. Innocent people die in war... and that's why war remains a complex and disturbing moral issue.
My friend Rick works for a global technology company... and travels the world on business. I include his dispatches here because they're great. And since he's on another globe-hopping venture for the next month... you'll be seeing one of these dispatches every few days. South Korea is wired, like no other country on earth. And wireless. People use their cell phones to put their restaurant tab on a credit card. Most elevators have video screens, usually in high definition TV. MBC-TV had the country's leading soap opera showing in its elevators. In my hotel it's Bloomberg. In the elevator lobby, a comely young woman in a half-ton embroidered gown is presumably well-paid just to smile at everyone who boards. In the expansive lobby of a Korean trade association, a big-screen TV was showing--of all things--Judge Judy. It was an unusual nod to Western pop culture in a country that doesn't much care for most of it. I'd like to think it was a mistake. Talk about technology--I was told by a government official that a big multi-lane bridge across the broad Han River is mechanically raised during the rainy season to keep from being flooded. Why not just build it higher in the first place? I didn't get a chance to ask. South Korea is living in the shadow of The Bomb. The brinksmanship with North Korea is far more front-page than Iraq, and the people I've met think Bush is failing to handle the former, while pursuing the latter with inexplicable fanaticism. Their clear and present danger is just up the road in Pyongyang, not in some faraway third-rate desert domain. They're worried. It is a country where extreme political positions co-exist. Strident left- and right-wing organzations wield power that ebbs and flows with voter sentiment. Right now the liberals are in favor with the new government, which has a long memory and many little ways of settling the score with conservatives who opposed its rise to power. There is strong sentiment both for and against the big US military presence that's been here for half a century. Those of a certain age who remember the American role in rescuing the country want to keep it. Younger ones are impatient to get the soldiers out. The expanse of open space in front of City Hall offers ample room for either side to turn out several hundred thousand orderly demonstrators, and they do it with some regularity. There's lots more open space inside the cavernous soccer stadium left over from last year's World Cup frenzy. A few tourists wander through to admire the manicured field and glassed private boxes while the South Korean team's fight song plays over and over on a very good sound system. What do you do with a 60-thousand seat stadium, just slightly used? They still play some games there, but the madness is probably over. Koreans overheat their offices and probably their homes, as is so often done in the Midwest. My host at one meeting today got up and opened the window when he noticed the sweat streaming down my brow. It was an oven in there. Maybe those freestanding heating contraptions get out of control, but they are apparently used to it here. Today was White Day. In Korea, Valentine's Day has evolved into a day when women give men a gift. A month later, on March 14, the men are obliged to reciprocate, and today they could be seen scrambling everywhere with bags of candy in hand. Cynics claim the day was invented as a way for confectioners to dump their leftover Valentine's candy. Japanese confectioners at that. The Japanese are often reviled or envied, or both, by Koreans. Korea, like much of the world, is badly in need of spring. The gray branches in the woods are drained of any trace of color, all dry leaves and dead twigs without even a hint of green to be seen anywhere. It feels as dead as things can get and still come back to life. But the trees in the hotel sculpture garden look like they were built for blossoms. White Day has put a spring in certain steps. It won't be long before Seoul blooms again.
With the prospect of war growing over the past several days, I've been trying to come to a few concrete reasons why I support this war. Because I do... at least to a certain extent. And I think there are many of us peaceful people, principled liberals, who feel uncomfortable with what might be about to happen... and yet willing to allow that there are some good reasons for it. It's odd though, because even as I type those words, I feel a pang in my stomach. I think more than anything, I'm pissed off at President Bush for making such a mess of this conflict. He has said that Iraq is funding Al Qaeda. I don't think this is true and I don't think we've seen hard evidence of this. The President has also said that Iraq poses a direct threat to America. I don't think this is true either. But maybe there are still some reasons for this endeavor. In my opinion, we should have finished the job we started in 1991 by driving straight to Baghdad and unseating Saddam. The near chaos that came afterward, the massacres in southern Iraq, were in part our fault. We left Saddam's opposition hanging in our haste to get out. This bad decision continues to haunt us. And maybe there's something to be said for going in and taking care of old business. I think there's no question that a stable and dare we say democratic Iraq could have a stabilizing effect on the region. But having said that, we have to be prepared to spend the years and the billions of dollars it will take to rebuild Iraq... not just its infrastructure but the political and social infrastructure of the country. This is a cost that we should share with Europe-- a different and more permanent kind of Coalition of the Willing. Much has already been said about the President's dislike of nation-building but that is precisely what we have to do to ensure that overthrowing Saddam doesn't lead to another Saddam. For me, the most compelling (and still problematic) argument for regime change is the potential to create a stable Iraq, which might encourage more democratic change in Iran... and the potential for peace in the Mideast. I believe this is America's responsibility. We don't need to be the global policeman or promote a new kind of imperialism. But our best export remains democracy and I don't have a problem with America being more proactive in promoting democracy. Having said all this, there's still something that gnaws at me about this. And for that reason and others, I hope that if there is a war, it's brief and decisive.
I did that urlLink shoulder workout that urlLink Jockohomo recommended and I included in the journal earlier this week. And it kicked my ass . I'm using italics because my arms are too tired to hit the bold key. :) The thing about working out is that what matters more than quantity is the quality of the workout you do. So there I was, doing just 4 exercises... a total of 14 sets... for a bodypart that I usually devoted 9 different exercises to. Now, I like how my shoulders are developing. But from the very first set today, I saw the veins in my shoulders popping out-- no doubt in surprise at the new movements I'd decided to spring on them. Under my skin, the muscles rippled and responded. I was done in about 30 minutes-- actually less. I was about to do some more just because it seemed so strange to be finished so soon. And then I lifted my arms up and at that point, I knew that I'd be feeling this workout full-on in about a day and a half. Check out that shoulder workout, gym boys. If you've reached a plateau on shoulders... or simply want to shake up your shoulder routine, this could do the trick. Or integrate these exercises into your current routine. Now, to find a biceps/triceps workout that kicks ass, too. I finished reading urlLink "In Search of Lost Time" today... and so ends a 6 year quest. There were plenty of times over the last 6 years when I wondered if I would put the book down and never pick it up again. And, in fact, there were many months when I didn't read it. At one point, I left it alone for a year. It's too early to talk about what I feel after finishing it. After all, we're talking about 3700 pages. But like most novels, the author's words are a mirror in which we see ourselves in a new light. What's next? I'll read urlLink "The Human Web" and urlLink "How Proust Can Change Your Life" this weekend... and then decide where to go from there.
I broke my isolation briefly today... spending a few hours at lunch with my friend Jason. More than a week and a half into my stay here, he's the first person I've spent time with... and he might be the last. I guess it's odd to say that I'm alone because the more accurate thing to say might be that I'm alone in crowds. I'm spending all my time in coffee shops reading or listening to live bands... working out... browsing the electronics stores... and then doing more reading. None of that time is actually isolation. And then there's also the fact that I'm on TV every night on a network watched by more than a million viewers a week in my home state. But regardless... I am alone and it feels good. Although less good this week than it did last. Last week was heaven. This week, I'm starting to miss friends more. I've been in touch with Matt and Chris daily by phone... as is my habit. But the phone is never enough and within a few days I'll be ready to get back home again... even if it does mean an end to this virtual vacation. One of the truly great benefits of being on vacation is having the luxury of spending a solid hour or more every day with the newspaper. If you have a few minutes and you want to try to stretch your mind around this idea... check out this new and controversial urlLink theory of the universe from Science Times . I've decided that when I'm finally finished with my show and can reclaim a chunk of my life... I'm going to: 1) subscribe to the NY Times. 2) subscribe to Harpers, The New Republic, Rolling Stone, and who knows what else. 3) read one more book every month. Are you laughing yet? Well, damn it I need these fantasies so I can be happy. It's the ideal versus the reality of the situation, I guess. Microsoft is releasing the second beta of urlLink Office 2003 . It looks pretty and has number of nifty new features. I still think Office for OS X looks even better. But hey, it's new and it comes right at the point when I'm looking for some new software to play with. I'll play with the beta of Office 2003... just as I did with Office XP a couple years ago. Might mean a few more system crashes... but I could use a new toy in my life right now-- short of a boy-toy, I guess. I will finish Proust tomorrow. It's amazing that after about 6 years, I'm nearly finished. On Sunday, nearly 6 years and 3500 pages after the taste of a madeleine soaked in tea brought back a flood of memories to the narrator... the same man tripped on a paving stone and discovered the secret to experience and the meaning of memory. Of course, a few other things have happened along the way. :) In any case, the journey is nearly over. I don't think I've ever offered a high recommendation for the books... but I think they should rank among the greatest novels ever written. If you can hack it, you should give them a shot. Just don't give up too soon or I think you'll miss out on the greatness of this novel. I logged on to gay.com on Sunday evening for what I thought would be a few minutes. And there, chosen as the "Hot Guy of the Day" type person was a guy who looked like my friend Joe from Milwaukee. It's been at least a year since I'd talked to him... so if nothing else, his handsome face led to a quality hour of catching up and good-feeling. He dropped me an email yesterday: I have received hundreds of responses, very few of which I actually read. It's been an interesting experience to have guys from all over the country writing and offering to be my next boyfriend. Are gay men so shallow that they base their compatibility with somebody based solely on photos and a few sentences in a profile? For the 478 guys who have written to me, i would say yes.
I haven't done this for a few weeks and since I'm having all sorts of personal revelations that I don't feel like revealing quite yet... why not pass on some ideas and links I've encountered in the past few days? from urlLink Jockohomo comes a link to this list of urlLink Weightlifting Mistakes compiled by Men's Health. I'm officially a transgressor of two of these... maybe you are too. And just at the point where I'm looking to reinvigorate my shoulder workout... here's urlLink an article from Men's Fitness . The Oracle of Omaha speaks! Warren Buffet released his annual letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway yesterday. If you have any interest in investing, or specifically the Warren Buffet approach to investing, then this is a urlLink must read . Besides that, it's by far the most enjoyable and straight-forward annual report you will ever come across. urlLink Cucalambe became a year old this past week. Walt blew out the candles and he's also sporting a new design. Speaking of which... my borrowed Blogger template is aging rapidly. urlLink Soblo has a great tip on urlLink how to find love on the subway . You know, this is doing nothing to help the feeling that so many of my blog entries have been kind of lacklustre lately. I was reading another one of those authors today who writes that adversity and suffering is what gives one the experience necessary to produce a work of literary art. I do think I write better stuff when I'm suffering in some way. Right now I'm kind of lonely but I'm hundreds of miles away from most of my friends. Being lonely for a couple of weeks doesn't really qualify as suffering. The only serious kind of adversity I'm experiencing these days is the fact that I haven't seen Six Feet Under or Queer As Folk. I only have HBO at my hotel and I've been away every evening that Six Feet has been on. There is a certain kind of lingering sadness that remains... weeks after Dave and I broke up. I thought I got over it rather quickly. In fact, I was surprised at the speed of my recovery. At the time, I thought it was because Dave and I both understood what we were lacking and what we needed to do about it. Intellectually, I still think the argument is airtight. But, there's always the heart to complicate matters, right? The hard facts are that I still love him and still miss him and yearn (god, I hate that word) for him. Here, the intellect intervenes again to tell me that this will probably be the case for a long time. It reminds my of why we made this decision to move on. It evens points an accusing finger at me to ask why I would yearn for the days of a relationship that was as difficult as ours was. Good question although I know the answer to it. It's because I love him. And this is the part that I don't have an answer for yet-- how do you handle a situation where you know that what the two of you have done is right... but still you love him and feel for him? It's not a sexual thing... but this is the thing that is probably key to the answer of Dave and I -- at least from my point of view. I need Dave... truly need him. But the nature of the need is not exactly along the lines of a romantic relationship. What is the nature of it? hmm... too personal to talk about here maybe. It's not sexual and this is the part that is hard to explain because it gets to the crux of what it is that exists between Dave and I-- or at least what I think is there. There are some friendships you can have that are so special that they transcend some of the boundaries of friendship. This isn't sex with friends... it's a kind of interaction and emotional intimacy that occurs rarely, I think. I have that connection with a couple of close friends. Dave is one of those. Why I still feel this depth of sadness about him... I'm not sure. But that's what time is for, right?
... in the shower, underneath the hot spray of water... basking in the warmth and steam. I feel cleansed... almost as though my pores have opened and the accumulated toxins are slowly dissipating. It's a great feeling. I've spent the last week out here in Iowa doing my duty for PBS. But that's taken only a part of the time. The rest of the time, I've been alone... alone among strangers... reading and writing and thinking. This is probably one of the most fruitful times I've experienced in at least a year. I don't know that I've necessarily put my affairs in order or dealt with any pressing issues... but the clearing away of the clutter of daily life for a few days can't but have done me a lot of good. I've done all these things the past few days that are so unusual for me. For instance, yesterday after the regular workout, lunch and required reading at the coffee shop... I spent about an hour wandering around CompUSA looking at everything and nothing in particular. I went to mall for a while and browsed. I stopped by the Barnes and Noble and spent an hour and a half reading and looking at books. At the end of all that, I didn't have any sense of having wasted time or missed work that I should be done or a book that I should be studying for work... or anything like that. I simply had a great time. And most important... it was by myself. I don't know why this is so important to me. But it is. There are times in my life where I literally ache to be by myself. It's not a continuous feeling but when it arrives, it stays for a long time. So even as I'm happy to see friends like Chris, Dave and Matt... most of the time I'll spend with myself. Writing is a kind of personal healing. But for me, reading is an even greater form of personal healing.
I just came from breakfast at urlLink the Machine Shed . The Machine Shed is one of the phenomena that you could only find in Iowa. But it's symptomatic of a trend that swept America years ago. The sign above the restaurant says "Farming is Everyone's bread and butter." The Shed is a tribute to the American farmer. But dining there, you'd think it was more a tribute to cream and butter. In its favor, one must say that urlLink the food is good . Every is real... the mashed potatoes included. The bread is supposedly made on the premises or at least nearby. But in that tradition of American eating, the portions are huge and the fat and cholesterol counts are off the charts. A friend of mine says that this is one of those places where the people going in actually look like the food they're going to eat while they're there. My hotel is next door and I see rotund individuals waddle toward the entrance. They're famished and ready to eat a hearty meal, even though their fat stores could keep them alive for weeks. The point here is not to make fun of fat people. The point is that Machine Shed looks back to the age when the Iowa farmer came in from a hard day's work in the fields and ate this exact same food... succulent beef or pork, mashed potatoes, thick gravy, vegetables, a big slice of pie, a pile of bread and plenty of butter to slather over it. Unfortunately, the Machine Shed perpetuates the myth that we can still eat that way today-- frequently and without consequences-- even though we're burning only a fraction of the calories of a turn-of-the-century Iowa farmer at our desks and cubicles. It's like the myth that the fast food giants perpetuate in getting us to accept the proposition that value means MORE... more low-grade beef, high-fat and high-salt fries, followed by a humongous serving of high-fructose corn syrup in a cup. I'll let Eric Schlosser pick up from there. If you haven't read it... urlLink Fast Food Nation is a gripping book that will change how you think about fast food. After all that, there are times when I love to eat at The Machine Shed. I like a moderately high-fat and high-carb breakfast on some days. Eggs and pancakes there are damn good. The breakfast buffet on the weekends is to die for-- and heck, you just might if you get it too often. For lunch, I wouldn't miss the hot turkey sandwich. Who could say no to a thick slice of bread with turkey piled on top and mashed potatoes and gravy covering it all? Wow! Add to that, the big bowls of cottage cheese and coleslaw... and you are in hog heaven. Moderation, my friends, is key. Now pass the hashbrowns.
There's some great writing about the genius of Proust in urlLink The Spectator 's review (unfavorable) of urlLink a new translation of Proust's works that has just appeared in Britain and Canada. At the risk of breaking some kind of copyright, let me reprint some of that article here... The single problem facing any translator of Proust is that there is, really, no equivalent of his style in English. He is at once classical and idiosyncratic; the rhythms and proportions of classical French style are followed faithfully in every sentence, and over the whole book. The end result looks so alarmingly new, however, because the proportions and rhythms are employed on an unprecedented scale. The novel really is one novel, and not, like Anthony Powell, a sequence of novels; his sentences are always immense, balanced epigrams. The novel has an essential orthodox classicism which emerges, on such a scale, as revolutionary audacity. When the narrator observes, early on, that Gilberte’s handwriting is so affected that her capital G’s and A’s cannot be distinguished, he is lighting a fuse which will not explode for 2,000 pages; between the first observation and the telegram which leads the narrator to believe that Albertine is still alive, no reference to this fact is made. Both the Duc de Guermantes, in Le Côté de Guermantes and M. Verdurin in La Prisonnière are told of a bereavement on the threshold of a party, and both say, ‘You’re exaggerating’; the reader is expected to notice the echo, and draw large conclusions about society from it. The curious style in which M. de Saint-Loup and M. de Charlus first befriend the narrator is, in each case, noted, but left mysterious for hundreds or thousands of pages. Proust never abandoned the classical methods of anticipation, echo, mystery, solution. He was absolutely steeped in classical French literature, and found it hard, I think, to imagine an existence which was any different. Certainly his characters are always trying to turn themselves into characters in literature, and not quite realising how well they are succeeding. M. de Charlus’ favourite author is Balzac, and he has turned himself into one of Balzac’s most demonic characters; if he consistently misreads the people around him, from the two dopy sons of Mme de Surgis-le-Duc to the polite butcher he pays to whip him, it is because he wants them all to be Balzac grotesques, too. M. de Guermantes’s tales of his ancestors quite often turn out to be misremembered stories from Saint-Simon — very famous ones, too. Albertine and her friends begin by trying on some very inappropriate roles from Racine. The final effect is of a world trying to live up to literature, and generally failing. The one thing that does not fail is the book itself, and it exists within the purest and most conventional forms of the French novel. When these methods are applied on so vast a canvas, it leads to a work of the highest audacity and originality. It has never been done in English in quite the same way, and a translator must make his way without a guide.
I thought I was the only one who thought President Bush gave a strange and not very good performance last night. Maybe you thought the same thing. The networks didn't say anything about it. The restaurant where I was watching the news conference had CBS on and Dan Rather couldn't say goodbye and get to "Survivor" fast enough. But urlLink the Washington Post's Tom Shales caught it, too .
A good Italian meal, a couple of glasses of wine and the President for dinner. hmmm... why do I have indigestion? I watched the President make the case for war with Iraq-- possible war, he called it-- while eating dinner tonight. I'm one of those few Americans who isn't virulently pro-war and isn't virulently anti-war. I'm kind of sitting on the fence on this one-- at least for the moment. I'm cynical about the President's presentation of the case for war. This doesn't mean I think he's doing it for oil. That's way too naive. But this constant connection between what happened on 9/11 and Iraq makes me want to ask a lot of questions. If this is a part of a new, more interventionist American doctrine toward the world, I'm willing to accept that. Mainly because I think it's the real reason behind what we're probably about to do in Iraq. But if that is the case, there are still plenty of questions. What are the limits of this doctrine? Does this mean a fundamentally unilateral approach to the world for the remainder of the Presdient's term? At it's heart, is there necessarily anything wrong with a more proactive stance, militarily speaking? If not, what about the international bodies and their continued relevance? Have those institutions lost their relevance? What about the expanding institutions like the EU and NATO? I think these are important questions... so no, I'm not going to offer a quick and dirty opinion on war here. CNN and Fox News Channel specialize in quick and easy answers. I don't believe there are such things. This was one of those days where I very nearly skipped working out. But I didn't and in the end, I was glad I went. I also had a good discussion with my friend Matt about a workout question that I'll pose to those of you who workout. If you're experiencing a great deal of muscle pain-- let's say in your thighs and butt from a particularly heavy workout yesterday... do you give yourself a rest today even though you were scheduled for a chest and biceps workout, for instance? Here's the question that underlies that: if we take a holistic view of our muscles does an exceptional strain on one muscle group result in a strain upon the others, too? Or should I go ahead with that chest and biceps workout even though my legs and butt are crying for mercy? Matt posed that question to me... and it's a good one. Most of the time, I tend to compartmentalize my body. Muscle pain in one body part doesn't prevent me from working out another body part. But all of us know that under certain circumstances, working out with a cold can make the cold worse because the strain of muscle recovery causes your body to divert resources from fighting the cold. So b ack to the question. If my body is working hard to repair all the micro-tears in the muscles of my glutes and quadriceps... should I create more stress for it by working another body part today or should I give my body a day to rest? As usual, I can see the reasoning behind a couple different answers... pushing ahead or taking the day off. This is why I'd make a good diplomat but not a good politician. Anyway... if you have any thoughts... write!! urlLink Chrisonomicon is enjoying the good life in Mexico and soon will be enjoying some time away in New York and Montreal. hmmm... I'm torn between going to Colorado to ravage urlLink his boyfriend or to NYC to ravage him. Both of those guys are hot young men... but of course, they are dating and thus are kind of off limits. But damn it... I'm single so let me have a little fantasy. I'm at urlLink Java Joe's tonight. I have the evening off so I'm out with a couple good books and my Palm and keyboard to do some writing. The local salsa band Twistin' Trees is performing tonight-- actually a pretty good band. I had two glass of cabernet for dinner so I'm not too shy to stare back at the cute gay boys who are looking at me. Why do so many people treat this kind of behavior in such a nonchalant way? For me, it's still scary. Alhough I should be happy that it's not paralyzing me with fear... as it used to. My first instinct is still to look away if I see a cute guy and he returns my gaze. This has been proven to be a bad way to get dates. But I'm trying to be better about this. I wonder if there's a class I can take. My latest really cheap, much desired item: a USB-powered light for my laptop. Ah, the simple things bring the most pleasure, dont they? :) I'm actually looking for an excuse to buy a new Palm. This has been my quest since last year. And the Palm urlLink Tungsten T has been the most powerful argument so far for buying a new one. The "T" is lightning fast, has an incredibly bright screen... and will make it possible for me to buy a whole array of urlLink new accessories ... something I can't easily do anymore for my old Palm Vx. There's a urlLink Tungsten W with wireless capability but I don't feel I need wireless capability in my Palm; besides, the "W" has less power than the "T" and runs an older version of the Palm OS. Why this is the case is a good question. Maybe I should just be happy with my new CD burner. :) My friend Gerry has developed urlLink new software that allows your computer to interact with a Replay TV box that has networking capability. I own a Replay 4000 so I might make that my next project... using my spare computer's 35 GB of free space to store TV programs for archival purposes. mmmm... technology isn't as fun as sex... but sometimes it's almost as good as masturbation.
Pete Taylor died today. For more than 30 years, he was the voice of the urlLink Iowa State Cyclones . He was urlLink Sports Director at urlLink NewsChannel 8 for more than 20 years. He was an amazing guy and his death is a surprise and a shock to us all. I watched Pete Taylor do the sports when I was a kid... during those highly impressionable years when I was deciding that broadcasting was going to be my future. His voice has been a part of my life on Cyclone games in the years since then. CNN Live From... Proust Over to Wolf Blitzer! Just a moment for an update because I know you're so interested in my progress with Proust. Or it's more likely that you're anxious to know when I'll be finished with it because I'll finally stop talking about it. Well, tonight I begin the final book of urlLink "In Search of Lost Time" -- Time Regained. So we're talking about another 400 pages and I'll be finished with the 3600 pages of Proust after 6 years of reading and talking about it. Someone wrote to ask about a good way to get into Proust. I didn't know all that much about him six years when I started reading him... and I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with jumping in. Just keep in mind, it might be like jumping into a very cold lake. The thing is, if you don't get hypothermia, you'll find you actually grow accustomed to the water relatively quickly. Here are a few good Proust resources online that you might find helpful. urlLink Proust Ephemera urlLink The Marcel Proust Support Group urlLink Temps Perdu Edmund White has written a nice little appreciation of urlLink Proust that's well worth reading. It's full of enjoyable anecdotes about Proust's life... and makes that connection between the story and the author that is so vital to understanding "Lost Time."
It's a cloudy morning and one of those mornings where I'm feeling particularly lazy and thinking about skipping the workout. Under my normal pattern, I'm due for a day off, but I've scheduled myself to work out every day that I'm in Iowa-- mainly to keep the workout on the fast track (to what??) and to continue my habit of over-scheduling myself all the time... even on pseudo-vacations. I'll probably go. It's a leg workout, which I dislike... but it'll be quick. I'm perched in my second favorite coffee shop in Des Moines-- Zanzibar's. Good coffee, but small... so finding a seat can take some work. Des Moines could use some work (first prize, one week in Des Moines; second prize, two weeks). Another ten years, and it could have a chunk of downtown that's thriving. There are already cool loft apartments and some good places for food and drink. I've been loving having the extra time to read and do some thinking. It's interesting, but why is it that when I'm thinking the hardest, I'm writing the most banal stuff? I'm about to burn my first CD. I've done it at work... but with my new laptop, I have my first personal CD burner. I went to Best Buy yesterday and I swear I shopped for blank CD's like one shops for a rare watch. I was checking labels and all that kind of stuff. And then I reminded myself... blank CD's are a commodity and I'm spending 20 minutes reading the fine print on blank storage media . Kind of embarassing, huh? Still, it was fun to browse the electronics. The Best Buy sales force has become more proactive than I remember... some might say intrusive. I think what they should do is hand out "I'm Browsing" buttons to guys like me who walk in... and "I'm Buying" buttons to people who are there with the clear intent of buying something. Each group would get a different level of interaction with the sales staff. What do you think? Well, maybe it wouldn't fly. But here I am, standing there with an interest in the new Palm Tungsten T, for instance. I don't plan to buy today or maybe even in the next 6 months, but I want to get my hands on some new technology to keep abreast on what's new. It's harder than I imagined to express that to an eager salesman. I want to play for a little bit and no, I'm not interested in the new financing deal. The commercials stress that Best Buy is this "guy place" where you can go play and indulge the kid in you. So let me do it! :) I bought a couple of Lonely Planet guidebooks yesterday... one for Quebec and the other for Paris. I've been thinking of a trip to Montreal or Quebec City for a few days this summer... and I have this romantic vision of going to Paris in the fall. If Paris happens, it would be my first trip to Europe. And at 35, isn't it about time that I start to see at least a tiny bit of the rest of the world? Paris may not be the best place to immerse oneself in another culture, since I'm not a good French speaker. So maybe it'll be Quebec City for that first Francophone experience later this year.
I'm sitting in urlLink Java Joe's having a $1 cup of coffee and watching people come and go. This has to be the cheapest cup of coffeehouse coffee you can find... and it's damn good. Java Joe's qualifies as one of the coolest coffee shops in the city. In my experience there aren't many challengers around here. Most of the coffee shops here are in strip malls and have tile floors. They are thoroughly unwelcoming places if you want to sit down with a cup of coffee and stretch it out to three cups over the course of a few hours with a good book. Of course, Java Joe's isn't the best place to read a book on a night like this. There's a lot of loud music and young people... and while the activity is perfectly conducive to journaling, it's less of a time to read Proust. I just finished dinner at a little Italian place nearby. It's probably the only "trattoria" style restaurant with an O'Doul's clock on the wall. It suddenly occurs to me that I've seen 5 obviously gay guys in just the last 30 minutes. Granted, I'm sitting in a coffee shop where one is likely to encounter this sort of thing. But I grew up in this state, and what I've seen in just the last half hour is behaviour and a public display of sexual orientation that you wouldn't have seen around here when I was growing up. I'm not going to make too much of it... just note it for what it is. I certainly wish I had felt this kind of freedom when I was youngerto be as authentic about who I am as these young people are. Again, don't get me wrong. I don't want to make Iowa sound like a gay mecca... because Lord knows it ain't. I'm going to be here for the next two weeks and so I'm planning to use my time to find some more cool, non-chain places to read, eat and just generally hang out.
I'm rushing the week along so I can get to the weekend and some time away... which I'm really looking forward to. Especially since I've had to put the kibosh on the DC trip in early May, a story I won't offer in detail here because I don't feel like digging through the emotional garbage can at this point to try to root it out. There will be another trip to DC in early summer... but will things be the same anymore? Probably not but then maybe that's the way it is. Friends acquire boyfriends and the rest of us must recede somewhat to make way for the new guy. This makes a certain amount of sense. I always thought friends have a primary position that boyfriends don't get the privilege of nudging to the side until they've paid their dues... but maybe that's why I'm single. :) In any case, it's not something to go on about. The trip to Toronto takes on greater importance in my mind as a result of that and other reasons... and I wish tomorrow was Friday. By the way... urlLink today it's safe to travel to Toronto . Yesterday it wasn't. This morning it also wasn't. But now it is. Huh. A victory for Canada and for Torontonians, who banded together against the advisory. To quote today's urlLink NY Times : "... the public has become unified and defiant in protest to an advisory that residents overwhelmingly believe was unnecessary and excessive." I'm still nudging 150 lbs... trying to encourage my body to move on to 155. There's a lot of resistance and I'm probably helping some by respecting a kind of psychological barrier to weighing more than 150. It's been 2 years now since I last weighed more than 150 lbs and I can feel the resistance to crossing that line again. I know that if I get to 155 with the kind of muscle I have now that I'm going to look very good. In fact if I can hold my low bodyfat and progress to 160, I may try to have sex with myself. (Before six people from Ann Arbor, Michigan, write to tell me that I'm vain, I'm only talking relative to myself. Next to a good looking guy or a guy who is highly-built, I look pretty weak. But... fuck them-- in Christian love, of course.) Hmm... sex has been an undertone of much of my writing here lately. Well, it's on the mind. It's spring. The urlLink sap is running again... or something like that. Maybe I'll use this as my excuse for not wanting to do any work. I should be studying and here I am tapping away at the journal. But as with everything, it's always a calculation of what you can afford to put off and what absolutely must be done. Work has to be done. But it doesn't have to be done right now. The earring has returned... after a six year absence. I thought the hole might have closed up but I assumed it would probably stay open because of scar tissue. So yesterday, I bought a tiny silver hoop and it went in without a hitch. I love it because it's so small. I think 3-4 people at work mentioned it today. I wouldn't be surprised if hardly anyone else saw it. The regulars at the gay bar didn't see it tonight when I stopped there to get my Tuesday All You Can Eat Spaghetti. The roommate noticed. _________________________________ The Tale of Two Freds Fred Phelps, who has so eloquently reminded us that urlLink God Hates Fags , has announced plans to demonstrate this weekend in urlLink Pittsburgh at a memorial service for Fred Rogers. Yes, Fred and his roving band of loons will be there to tell grieving parents and children... who remember Mr. Rogers for his kindly words and encouragement... that he is in Hell. Make no mistake... Phelps is doing this for one reason and one reason only: to get more media coverage (including from CNN), and to try to generate a confrontation that will allow him to sue the city, settle out of court and win more money to use for more pickets like this one. Make no mistake... words of hate shouted in his direction are no better or worthwhile than the hate he flings back at us. There is a positive way to respond. Groups around the country have used the Phelps pickets as an urlLink opportunity to raise money for AIDS and LGBT causes. Individuals. We were one of the first in Ann Arbor to do it in 2001. And now we have another chance to make a statement to Fred Phelps about hate... we can show him that each time he promotes hate against the LGBT community, it can use the opportunity to raise more support. Phelps is expected to spend an hour this Saturday, May 3 from 1:30 - 2:30 picketing Mister Rogers Memorial Service. I'm pledging $1 to urlLink Shepherd Wellness Community , a Pittsburgh AIDS Service Organization, for every minute Phelps is picketing the Memorial Service. If you can, join me. Let's make sure that the message CNN sends out this weekend is that civilized people responded to Phelps message of hate by turning it into a positive message of tolerance and support that would make Fred Rogers' proud. Let's let Fred (Phelps) help us raise money for our community. With your help we can turn a potential travesty into an unexpected windfall for Shepherd Wellness Community. urlLink Click Here to find out how to pledge.
Nothing like that careful, balanced reporting that you expect from Fox News Channel, huh? Yes, out of a population of 2.5 million people there are about 140 people who are sick with SARS. Apparently thousands of people are deciding not to travel to Toronto out of fear that they might catch SARS. And yet, there has been no mass exodus from Toronto last time I checked. Torontonians are wantonly exposing themselves to this virulent, deadly disease by... going about their daily lives!!!! I'm going to Toronto next weekend with my friends Matt and Leeron. We won't be wearing surgical masks, nor will we be carrying special handwipes, antibacterial washes or rubber gloves. We will be carrying lots of American cash, converted to Canadian currency... and an appetite for fun. The World Health Organization is advising hot bloggers like urlLink Soblo to leave the city before I and my virulent, fully engorged libido get there. Will I go to a bathhouse next weekend? I don't think I've told my bathhouse history. hmmm... don't think I will. :) Actually, there's not much of a history. I've been to Steamworks in Chicago and that's the extent of my bathhouse history, thanks for reading and goodnight. I've read my gay history... and my impression of bathhouses was of dark, dank, ugly buildings populated by sleazy types who couldn't get sex anywhere else. But then, trying to hook up online involves lots of contact with sleazy types who can't get sex anywhere else. And I've done that plenty of times in my past. I'm sure you can find plenty of sleazy bathhouses. But Steamworks is the antithesis of that. It's well lit (where it needs to be), clean, new... and populated by sleazy types who can't get sex anywhere else. And... there are other hot guys there. Dave and I went there last fall. We didn't participate all that much... it was more of an anthropological excursion... getting the key, stripping down and putting on a towel and then wandering around and checking out the flora and fauna. The cruising culture interests me wherever it exists... but in the bathhouse it's not hidden by the conventions of the bar or the gym. If you're there, it's for one reason: sex. The look is more open... desires are whispered, lips and hot breath felt on one's ear... the intention more clear. Dave and I had a good time... focused mainly on each other but also on the hot guys around us. It was an interesting moment for me. Sex has always been an intensely private thing. Not necessarily a guilty sin, although there have been times in my life when I've felt that. But there's something about bringing sex out in the open, in front of others, that can be a lot of fun. Although, I should say that when we went back to our cubicle, we went back without a third or fourth companion and we closed the door. But even when it was just the two of us naked, lips pressed together, bodies writhing, sweat glistening on fiery skin, it was an experience to hear the sounds of sex all around us. Kind of hot actually... for a guy who usually doesn't get into that sort of thing. But sex is about experiencing new sensations and conveying love and care to someone else. And over time, this becomes more clear to me. In that moment when his lips leave my nipple and I open my eyes and his eyes are looking back at me... that's a moment of sensation... and I think it's much more than that, too... but I'm not going to say any more because it brings back memories.
I think I'm going to Toronto next weekend. I feel like Mayor Bloomberg going to a Chinese restaurant. But what the heck... SARS has cleaned out the tourist riff-raff and Toronto is a great city to visit. So I'm in the process of gathering a couple willing friends to join me for a roadtrip next Friday.
Apparently, when surveyed, Sluts prefer to guzzle cum, rather than sip, pinky extended.
I must say it's great to see so many within the blogging community stepping forward to inquire about the state of my left index finger after yesterday's "playing with knife" incident. It's much better, btw. And thanks for all the suggestions for where to put it... Speaking of... ... the dumpy-looking guy with the mustache (as I was yesterday), if you look like Saddam (or are Saddam), London's West End needs you for an urlLink upcoming play .
Actually an explosion of work this week is keeping me busy... and I cut my left index finger today, which is annoying. I have a bandaid on it, which is alright except that the bandaid prevents me from executing the very fast 3-4 finger typing method I'm known for using. I cut my finger with a knife, which is how I always cut my finger. By that I mean, every time I play with a knife I cut myself. I've pretty much accepted it now so that if I pick up the knife and it crosses my mind to play with it, it also crosses my mind that I'm going to cut myself. This is convenient because it saves me the surprise that I might feel after cutting myself-- an unnecessary emotion since there's no surprise... because I always cut myself. Alright... moving on. Here's urlLink cheap wine that's not in a box, bottle with a screwtop or some old animal skin. The New York Times says the Charles Shaw line of wines sell for $1.99 at many Trader Joe's stores... where they're known as Two Buck Chuck. How does it taste? Let's ask NancY TIMES: relatively dry for inexpensive wines. This puts them in competition with more sophisticated table wines rather than the bag-in-a-box wines. The cabernet is light, pleasant and easy to drink and has little varietal character. Nondescript would not be too harsh a characterization. Nothing wrong with that: wine is supposed to accompany food and Charles Shaw will do that quite adequately. Another job prospect materialized today... yawn. In entertainment news, I'm going to see urlLink Kinsey Sicks tomorrow night. I hadn't planned to do such a thing... but it's a benefit for our urlLink regional LGBT paper , I have friends going, they urge me to believe it's funny, and thus far, I believe them. If they're wrong, I'll enjoy crafting a special punishment for both of them. The punishment won't be as enjoyable as it could have been... if only I hadn't cut my finger. My friend Matt and I have decided-- you know, here's the deal. Two years ago, I had one good gay friend named Matt. Life was simple, gas was cheaper and the dumpy looking guy with the big mustache ruled Iraq. A year later, being pleased with the friendship I had with Matt, I decided to acquire another Matt. Recently, I took a third good friend named Matt. And it's the third Matt who is causing trouble. Not him personally, his name. I don't want to have to use last names, or initials, or Matt the Tall or make sly references to endowment... so I'm going to call each one of them Matt. It's easier that way. For me. My friend Matt and I have decided to read a book together this summer. Not literally at the same time. But I guess it will be our own little book club kind of thing. We're going to read urlLink Bleak House . For those of you wondering, it's not about living with my roommate. It's a classic novel by Charles Dickens. I read it years ago, but it's worth reading again. It could be fun to read it and talk about it with each other. It could also turn out to be the most annoying thing we do all summer. I'm hoping that it's the former.
"I Stuck My Fingers In Myself For Money"
Congrats to fellow bloggers urlLink Puck and urlLink Soblo ... who met love, or something that might prove to be that, or an angel of some kind, on separate dancefloors this weekend. Amazing moments happen in pairs.
My first weekend with Chris in Washington since last fall... and I get sick. Not the out and out vomiting one's guts up, kind of sick. Instead, it was some low-level kind of stomach thing that basically kicked my ass all weekend. I never actually got sick. But I was tired, without energy, had an upset stomach and was unable to eat much at all. What was it? I have my suspicions: 1) from Sunday night to Friday morning, I slept a total of 9 or 10 hours. There's no doubt that this could not have been a good thing and may have left me vulnerable to something that came and went quickly; 2) on Thursday evening, I had dinner at a well-known Mexican restaurant in Ann Arbor. The next day I started feeling bad. That's kind of a long time for food poisoning to make its presence known. But I mention it only because something like this has happened twice before after eating there. In neither situation was it enough for me to do anything about it. I thought it was something else. Well, maybe it wasn't. Needless to say, it put a damper on the weekend. I had a hard time of it Friday night and went home early to sleep rather than go out dancing. Saturday I felt better but around 10pm I hit a wall again, so it was back home to bed for me. Whatever I had didn't keep me from working out, which only proves how obsessed I am. But on Friday, I had to breathe deeply to keep from getting sick while I worked out with Chris at Results. Still, it was great to see Chris again. I explained to someone today that I'm not leaving Ann Arbor. This is only 1,204th time in the past 2 months that I've had to explain this. So as you can see, it's not driving me $%^@^! crazy at all. It's not the fault of those who ask. The fault belongs with my employer, which-- after 3 weeks of agonizing over how to talk about some changes I was making in the work I do-- decided to put out a press release that was a piece of crap. Ari Fleischer would be proud. In fact, our old friend, the Iraqi Information Minister should read it for some new pointers. (And thank you, Jonathan Chait, for making the urlLink Fleischer/Saahaf connection .) The bottom line is, thanks to the disastrous press release... everyone thinks 1) I'm switching over to TV and 2) I'm leaving. Neither of which is the case. But still the questions come and I do my best to be nice and answer them. New jeans and cargo pants this weekend... from Abercrombie and Fitch. I figure a guy my age shouldn't be shopping there... but we were walking around in Georgetown on Saturday and one thing led to another. I also bought a couple of t-shirts that I can use to show off the pecs, biceps and abs this summer. And speaking of which, summer might actually get here. It's 63 in Ann Arbor, even as I speak, um, write.
one of the busiest weeks in months. The work never seemed to end, the week was rolling by one day slower than I thought it should be, I was getting 1-3 hours of sleep a night, etc. The sex was good this week, but it doesn't make up for 100% old fashioned sleep. I dropped on the bed at 5 o'clock this afternoon and slept till about 11:30pm... waking up only to get my clothes off and get under the covers. And I was barely awake then. When I woke up at 11:30... there was my PC, perched precariously on the bed with me... and a stack of the New York Times and the last couple months of the Times Literary Supplement. When will I ever get caught up on reading? Probably never, right? All of us will die some day far, far, into the future (we hope) thinking of at least three books that we wish we had read. I'll die wishing I could have had home delivery of the Washington Post. Threesomes. Generally, I shy away from then. I'm a one-on-one kind of guy and that approach extends to friends and dating and sex. I was in a threesome about 5 years ago that ranks as one of the most boring sexual experiences of my life. Three guys, brought together by IRC, without the benefit of pictures, at 3am. We had about as much sexual chemistry as the UN Security Council. Twice, I nearly fell asleep, once as I was sucking one of the guys off. Yes, it was that bad. So since then, I've avoided threesomes. I figure that if the spark is there, a threesome can be incredibly hot. But the chances are slim. I revisited the concept with a couple friends of mine this week and the result was... distinctly heated. I won't go into details. This isn't about bragging; I have sex so rarely compared to most other guys my age, that I'd be laughed out of the room. (I have been making up for lost time lately.) But I did have a great time. The other 2 guys are dating each other, which caused me a lot of thought this week, too. They are endlessly cool guys and good friends of mine, we have great nonsexual times together, great times being sexual... life is good. I don't know enough of gay cultural history... but at times in our gay past, there has been less of a delineation between the guys you had sex with and the guys you were friends with. Having that line clearly drawn can be a good thing and I don't plan to try to take all of my friends to bed. But I've been experimenting lately with crossing that line in a few situations. It becomes an extra thing that you share with those friends... and I think it can add depth to the friendship. At least it has worked in the situations where I've experimented with the concept. Generalizations like these are dangerous, I guess. But I'm not writing to represent everybody, right? I'm writing to represent myself. Three years ago I never would have written that, much less thought it. But, I've found that as I get more experience in life, I become more open to different possibilities, that my definition of what is a sexy guy grows wider, that my sexual tastes broaden. Yes, a few short years ago, my definition of hot was a 23 yr old with a big dick. Now it's someone between 23 and 25 with a big dick. um, right.
Ok so here's an interesting phenomenon. There are these two guys, whom I find incredibly hot. It's not merely that they're goodlooking. Not merely that they seem to have at least some of their shit together. Not merely that they have just enough attitude to make them sexy. It's mainly because the sight of them, the thought of them, makes me want to get naked and fuck. I can't even describe the feelings I get, they're so intense and um... earthy. hmmm... this is somewhat unusual. I don't get these intense kinds of feelings regularly. In fact, I don't remember getting them about a specific guy ever before. But now I do feel it... and for two guys at the same time. Neither one of them had better come near me unless he wants to deal with the consequences. Let's hope one of them does. :) Well now... nice to have that out of my system. Thank you, urlLink Soblo , for the pointer to the new urlLink official Iraqi Information Minister fan site . Speaking of which, here's another Iraq Information Ministry gem... a headline item from Iraqi TV on April 5th, picked up by BBC Monitoring: Official spokesman issues statement, read by Information Minister Al-Sahhaf, urging citizens not to believe fabricated statements.
hmmmm... urlLink his visage still haunts me. It's those eyes. Btw... if you've not seen the video of that little piece of urlLink street theater in Baghdad about urlLink 10 days ago , you ought to. Everytime I do, I laugh. Saddam looks so goofy and strange.
I'm drifting through the weekend... which isn't such a bad thing. I've been so tired the past couple of days and I'm not sure why. I tend to push myself to the limit, sleeping 2-4 hours a night. But I've actually been a little bit better about getting rest in the past few days. Apparently, not enough. (I slept a total of 3.5 hours on Monday and Tuesday nights.) I slept long and hard Saturday and Sunday mornings... getting up on time but feeling tired both days. Saturday night I went out with a couple friend, including a noted queer studies professor. The conversation was laid-back and enjoyable but I could barely keep my eyes open. I hate naps but I might have to make use of them... and maybe I'll let the Replay box capture Six Feet Under and Queer As Folk tonight while I capture some shuteye. I had a great time in the Twin Cities for a couple days, taking care of some business and seeing my friend Alex. He's a handsome, and dare I say hot, young man. I hope it's not too long before I get back there to say hello to him again. Next weekend, I'll be in DC. It's a short weekend trip, but it's been a very long time since I've been out there to see Chris-- the ex bf/now best friend. Last time was September or thereabouts. Well, I'll rectify that with a two day trip this weekend and a week-long trip next month. urlLink Jimbo ... expect a 48-hour coffee ultimatum from me any day now! Speaking of... nothing in particular... my checked luggage got inspected on the trip back from Minneapolis/St. Paul Friday. There was no evidence of it, except for a slip of paper inside from the Transportation Security Agency, informing me that my bag had been opened. The paper doesn't indicate whether it was a routine check or because they had spotted something in the x-ray that made them suspicious. I had a pair of steel-toed boots in there... and not much else-- a few pieces of clothing, the phone charger, cologne, etc. Maybe it was the pack of "larger fit" Trojans I was carrying. hmmm... they're not that large. urlLink Soblo celebrated a birthday this week. I'm mentioning it here late... but I did remember to email him on his birthday to wish him well. Just a brief defense of myself for posting so little this week... some catch-up is warranted. If I had lots of free cash, I'd arrange a big blogger gathering of the guys on my favorites list to the right. We'd meet in some central city and go eat somewhere... some place where we'd have great food, lots to drink, and the time to talk all night. How would we all be in person? I think we'd be a fun bunch. Alright... raise your hand if you're reading the entire Nation at War section in the New York Times everyday. Well, how about this... raise your hand if you're reading most of it almost everyday. That would be me. I've loved the stories on war strategy and now, the strategy of peacemaking and nationbuilding. This morning, I spent 90 minutes on that section of the paper alone. The rest of it is lying around... awaiting my attention after this written ramble gets published... and I finish the majority of my preparation for work tomorrow. But some of it counts as legitimate study... since I have interviews on SARS and North Korea later this week. Have a good Sunday, people... and we'll talk soon!
Saddam Denies Allied Invasion of Iraq; Insists Exploding Buildings Are Caused by Asteroids Iraqi Defense Ministry Promotes Brilliant "Reverse Advance" Tactic Iraqis Proclaim Saddam A "Leadership Target We Can Trust" Saddam Proven to be Author of Dead Sea Scrolls Saddam to Receive Belated Grammy Award for Multi-Platinum Album "Thriller" Saddam to Reprise Now Famous Role in Basra Production of "Rent" Saddam-Like Personage Basks in Public Acclaim; urlLink Appears Maniacally Happy Saddam: Syracuse "Overrated"; Kansas "Must Turn Away Infidels" Saddam Declares Old Country Buffet A "Bunker-Buster" Saddam Solves Mystery: Egg Came First Saddam Lookalikes Book 2004 US Tour Dates c 2003 Todd
I think that all of us could use a break from the seriousness of the continuous coverage. Beginning immediately, the networks should broadcast live coverage of the regular briefings from the Iraqi Information Ministry. Their daily reports of Iraqi victories, the destruction of Allied forces... the stories of failed Allied attempts to move into Baghdad... even as Allied tanks drive by in the background... might provide all of us with a good laugh.
What a great time to recharge! LOL whatever. :) Most of us anymore hope for a little bit of recovery. Recharging might be too optimistic a term for it. Actually, it's been an alright weekend, thus far. Got up early this morning, read the paper, worked out, took care of some errands... now I'm sitting here at the lapper listening to the great new mix CD I got from a urlLink hot, young Canadian . This disc is destined for the changer in the new truck. Speaking of reading (was I?), I finally had the chance to read urlLink Frank Deford's scathing piece on Kirby Puckett in Sports Illustrated. One hell of a sad story about a reprehensible man who has been so loved by millions of baseball fans. Stars can never live up to what we expect them to be. But when the reality is so divorced from the perception, it's truly sad. My neck got about 30 minutes of careful attention from a massage therapist yesterday-- enough to relieve the worst of the tension, although it's not erased the pain and discomfort. Still, I did get more range of motion... enough that I could get back to the gym this morning. I'll be checking in with my doctor in the next few weeks about this... and maybe I'll talk to a chiropractor, too. Here's why I'd probably not enjoy being President. For all the moments of leadership opportunities, being decisive, having access to intelligence... there are moments like this one. The New York Times reports on a urlLink meeting with Iraqi-American dissidents at the White House yesterday. Rahman al-Jebouri, a writer, said that he had a scar from a cigarette burn on his hand from Iraqi authorities who disliked one of the stories he had written. He also urged the president to reserve a place in a future government for those Iraqis who did not necessarily speak proper English. "Doesn't matter if your English is not all that good," Mr. Bush replied. "Some people say mine isn't either." Later in the meeting, Dr. Adil Awadh, who said he had been an intern in an Iraqi hospital in the mid 1990's, told the president that he had seen thousands of Iraqi opponents to Mr. Hussein have their ears cut off as punishment. Dr. Awadh said that some of the victims could no longer wear glasses and asked the president if they could be offered cosmetic surgery after the war. "Well, I appreciate you bringing that up," the president replied. "It's an interesting idea." Dr. Awadh then told the president, "If you treat some of these earless victims, this will help the Muslim world understand you better." Mr. Bush left the meeting immediately after the last exile had finished.
Saddam's doctor called a meeting of all the Saddam look-alikes. "Men, I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. The good news is Saddam is still alive. The bad news is he lost an arm."
I got a bunch of emails yesterday and today from readers about the 3/31 post. Some of the most interesting ones came from other weblog writers. Each of them recounted experiences of readers writing nasty email... in each case based on their own particular misreading of the weblog in question. Some of the same observations kept surfacing: 1) those of us writing these online journals are offering selected snapshots of our own lives. They're in no way representative of our day to day experiences. 2) most of us write about what bothers us... whether it's about ourselves, our boyfriends, work, sex, life, neighbors, parents, etc. That's why most people keep journals-- so they can write down their thoughts and work through issues. 3) many readers misunderstand... and some respond with bad advice and snide comments. 4) many weblog writers try to ignore them but usually engage them at some point, often in a classic email flame-war. One weblog writer says he reads those annoying emails and then deletes them. I'll read anything that someone sends me from a real address... but yesterday I made a new inbox rule that automatically deletes anonymous emails. It seems a waste of time to read an email that someone is too cowardly to sign. Either the writer is finished having his say or the rule is working; it also seems to have cut into the amount of spam I receive. Isn't it so old school to use the term flame war ? I'm trying to remember the last time I heard it used or read it somewhere. All I know is that writing it takes me back to 1993. It's like talk about wasting bandwidth . Even back in ye olde days, it struck me as a ridiculous concept. I wonder if, in 5 years, we'll have such sophisticated ways of dealing with spam that we'll consider that term to be archaic? A couple weblog writers made this point: the bottom line is, we write for ourselves, not for our readers. I think that's partially true for me. But I'm also writing somewhat for the audience. I want some readers to check out my journal regularly. I want them to find something funny or thoughtful, depending on the day. Or maybe they'll decide it's boring today but based on past days, they might come back and check tomorrow to see if its any better.
I have several flights scheduled in the next few weeks. I wonder... should I get a window seat so I can see if a urlLink terrorist plans to fire a missile at me ... OR should buy a urlLink surgical mask ? And will everyone on-board scream and run, if I cough?
Was on a little "putzing around" mission this afternoon and wandered through Best Buy and CompUSA. To urlLink Pancheros for a burrito. The gym. The urlLink paper . I love Saturdays like this where I have a hard time choosing which lazy activity I want to undertake. I can do all of them! Why am I not in Toronto? I don't know... I almost went yesterday... decided at the last minute not to. There's always next week. It feels different to be here in Michigan on a weekend. This is the second weekend in five that I've been at home. Today at Best Buy, I walked past an MP3 player, looked at the price and started calculating what it would be in US dollars before I remembered which side of the border I'm on. Oh yeah. I'm on the "invading other countries" side. Stopping by the urlLink bar for a few minutes last night with my friend Matt, I realized that I'm still on the quarantine list. We saw 3 or 4 people we knew as we walked in, and they said hi and made jokes about me actually staying home for a week. And not a one of them hugged me or kissed me. Two of them were gay men. Yes, you read that right. Two gay men met another gay man and no kisses or hugs were exchanged. No air kissing either; can't do that-- micro-droplets. In fact, there was a priceless moment where one of them took that very slight, but totally obvious, half step toward me, hesitated and stepped back. I nearly burst out laughing. I live in a state where a mosquito can give you West Nile Virus while you step outside to get the newspaper... and we're hyper-concerned about SARS? Besides, we're gay men. We've lived through AIDS. SARS is small potatoes. Now, the CDC's rules say that I'll be fully quarantined by next Wednesday-- 10 days after my latest trip to Toronto. Maybe I should wear a sign to assure people I'm fine. Maybe a festive, yet functional, bracelet. uh-huh. On the way down to see Chris on Thursday night... he calls. "You're going to love this story." Any story that he tells after that preface is usually pretty good. Chris's parents got DSL a month ago and we got them set up with a new lapper and a wireless box. So Chris jumps online to check mail and the connection is slow. Really slow. Abysmally slow. Not even "Developing World slow." We're talking "Ramada Inn slow." Chris ran a speed test on the 768 kbps line and it came back with a download speed of 39.9 k. Chris: "I can mail a letter and have it get there faster." When I got there we started digging around, disconnecting this and that, turning things off and then on again, jiggling switches and stuff, swearing, getting in each other's way, standing around muttering-- Gin and Tonics in hand. You know... tech support. In the end, it was a bad phone line filter. Removing it restored the service to full speed. Chris's parents had paid for a month of service that was worse than a dialup connection. I wonder if SBC will give them a refund? LOL, that's a good one...
Chris's eyes shine so brightly when he laughs. Hanging out in his parents' kitchen last night, drinks all around, he and I and his mom and dad talked with each other, at each other, around each other and over each other in the way that only Italian families can-- everyone jostling verbally for a space to make a point. All the while, I stirred the risotto, Chris sauteed the veal for the Saltimbocca, and urlLink Mac watched me for any sign that I might want to feed him a carrot. Two years ago, this exact same scene would have played out, except that Chris and I would have been boyfriends... approaching our first year together. We broke up at almost exactly this time two years ago. It ended what was, for both of us, our first serious attempt at a gay relationship. Both of us tried hard but each of us carries a series of personal reasons for the failure of it. I was too uptight in a lot of ways; in particular, I was sexually uptight. I wasn't ready to give Chris what he wanted. I didn't know what I wanted. A year ago, we were at his parents' place on the anniversary of our break up and we were able to look at each other and say that things were better. The difference another year has made is that it's now something I truly believe.
When I hugged him and said good bye last night, he said "See you in a year." And he's right. It was a year almost to the day since he was last in Ann Arbor. My friend Michael is one of those people who passes through my life ever so briefly when schedules and flights and itineraries allow. But when it happens, it soothes the soul in that way that you'd think only friendships that had lasted much longer could do. Michael and I met online two or three years ago or thereabouts. My memory is vague, but I think it was because of this webpage. Whatever the case, we began an irregular email correspondance that has blossomed to include a couple of visits... one last May and one this May. He lives in San Francisco, on the rare days when he's not travelling. His partner of 7 years lives in Connecticut... which explains some of the travelling. He's the managing partner of a consulting firm and has made a brilliant success of his life. And so as we talk about careers, boys, trying to make a relationship work, raising a young son with 2 dads, cruisey gyms... in the back of my mind, I wonder if this is the turn my life will take. Seven years from now, will I be sitting outdoors at a restaurant in DC, New York or Toronto talking to Michael or some other friend and reflecting on a life that has grown to include a boyfriend, a higher-level in my career, a new feeling of success, and a sense of inner peace? I don't feel a lot of inner peace these days. But that's not a bad thing. I think if we always had that kind of peace, we would never get anything done. We'd lay around eating ice cream sandwiches and watching Food Network. More than we do now. A kind of inner turmoil is what drives us to question ourselves, remake our lives, careers, loves, goals. I've had peaceful times, too... yeah sure it's a great feeling to get in between the covers at night and put your arms around your boyfriend and hold him close... or to be in one of those career moments where it feels like you're on a mag-lev train-- rushing forward at high speed, frictionless, floating a millimeter above the ground. But those don't last forever. I don't like turmoil anymore than anyone else but I do understand it's purpose. It makes me better. ___________________________ I've wandered off down the lane with that inner peace thing... but I intend to get to San Francisco this fall and make sure it's not a year before I see Michael again. I've just discovered, courtesy of NPR, that Angola has a Minister of Reinsertion. Moving along... A quiz: I have no clothes... a) on right now; b) that are bright green c) for summer. B and C are correct. C is on my mind now. I'm a walking Clothes Disaster Area. Well, I shouldn't be so hard on myself. I'll give my wardrobe a D for... effort (lack of). The problem is that I don't care enough. I mean, I'm a gay man. I do care. I have the money to buy cool clothes. But I don't have the eye or the confidence. And that's the problem. I'm a master at the careful integration of blue jeans and t-shirts, particularly if the shirts are blue or green. Red is a challenge, but I'm working on that. Khakis and blue or green t-shirts? Easy. Blue cargo shorts? Yes... a no-brainer. Anything beyond this requires a great deal of thought, concern, consultations with friends... meditation, oracles. I don't know. I suppose I should have confidence to chart my own course and not worry about it. But the thing is, when I do get it right I love it. I bought this hot, tight club wear kind of shirt in Toronto a few weeks ago and it looks good. It's tight in all the right places and when I put it on I think, "Wow, I have pecs and biceps." Number of times I've worn it since I bought it: twice. Location: in front of my mirror. You see, I know I can wear the top but I'm not sure what I can wear it with. Pathetic. This is going to be a good Thursday... biceps and triceps at the gym... a reasonable workload... some cleanup work on an outside project... and a visit to see my friend Chris. Oh... and say hello to urlLink tyger-tyger ... who has the misfortune of being the latest addition to my weblog list. Here's a story that will make you sick to your stomach. The Financial Times reports that the Bush administration has shelved urlLink a report from the Treasury Department showing the US faces a future of chronic deficits... totaling 44 trillion dollars . Enjoy your tax cut. If you got one.
You know, sometimes it's the entry that I begin with no knowledge of where I'm going to end up that turns out to be the most surprising. Or not. I've been in a quiet mood for the past couple of days. Well, weeks. My ex and I had it out last night over this but the issue isn't him. Well, ok it is. I've spent most weeknights in my room with the door closed listening to music and doing my work. And then, of course, there are the weekends in Toronto. I'm being a terrible friend to him but I can't face him right now so I think it's easier to give myself my own space rather than trying to interact with him in some fake way. We've already had a few of those moments in the past few weeks and it's much better and more honest, in my opinion, to just stay away. I wrote here a few weeks ago about how I feel this is a time of big change for me. I still don't entirely know what that means... but I feel like I'm morphing. Went out for a bite to eat and a few drinks last night with urlLink J . I gave him a lot of shit here about being young a couple weeks ago. And he is. Too damn young. But my gosh he's cute. So we had a great time hanging out while he discovered that since the whole staff urlLink here knows me, that I must be spending way too much time there. His mom came by the bar to pick him up about 10pm. LOL yeah I'm gonna get shit about that, too. Two important visits this week. Tomorrow night, my online friend Michael breezes through town from San Francisco. I haven't seen him in close to a year, so I can't wait to sit down and connect with him over some good food and a couple drinks for a few hours. Here's a little bit of the deal on Michael. He's from my home state... a couple years older than me... in a long-term, committed relationship... with a son from a previous marriage. Brilliant man, successful... and highly focused. I enjoy hanging out with him because I can hear about his life... and I can also strategize with him about mine. Thursday, Chris returns!!! Albeit briefly. He's my ex from Washington DC and I haven't seen him for a couple months so I'm anxious to catch up with him. We'll hang out at his parents' place, which means there will be loud carrying-on and all sorts of fun until long after I should be back home and getting ready for bed. Chris is one of my closest co-conspirators; you need those kinds of guys around as much as possible. He's also bringing my favorite yellow Lab back with him... who by the way, is one of my urlLink Friendster friends. My other co-conspirator, Matt, is recovering very slowly from SARS. It's not really SARS, of course, but it might as well be because it's taken him more than a week to work through this illness... whatever it was. Some kind of flu that does really awful things to your stomach. He moved into the restroom for about 3 days. (Yes, C, in Canada you call that the "washroom.") Upcoming trips in June: 2 weekend jaunts to Toronto, including urlLink Pride ... a speaking engagement in Arizona. In July... DC! The New York Times is offering to send me my choice of a free book. This is because they want me in a good mood ahead of the invoice they're about to send me. Considering the quality of my writing here lately, I think I'd better ask for the Manual on Style and Usage. Oh hey... in this age of SARS, and who knows when the next global influenza pandemic will break out, grab " urlLink The Barbary Plague " by Marilyn Chase. She's the medical reporter for the Wall Street Journal and she's written a brilliant account of the outbreak of Bubonic Plague in San Francisco in 1900. It's a great story of medical detective work, a public health achievement, and there are several interesting parallels to SARS. I read it yesterday. Today's skim read for work was " urlLink Stiff ." Maybe you've seen it advertised in the New York Times. It's Mary Roach's paean to the hard-working human cadaver. There's the standard medical research stuff but I had no idea how extensively human cadavers are used in automobile safety tests. If you think about it, the crash test dummy can't tell you how a particular accident might damage internal organs or how your shoulder might fracture in a side-impact crash. There's also a chilling but compelling chapter on how human remains provide a great amount of detail about what causes planes to crash-- particularly in cases where the black box is missing or destroyed. Roach interviewed one of the principal investigators of human remains from the crash of Flight 800 off New York. The bodies and-- let's face it-- fragments yielded up a wealth of detail about what brought down the plane. I can't get enough of this story... so I offer it up for inspection. Yes, urlLink the Festival of Rolling Cheese Down the Hill , made possible in part by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts.
It all starts out innocently enough as a few individuals with huge networks of thousands of friends start friendly wagers as to who can gather more. Soon, the contest turns ugly. Rivals comb their lists looking for any friend with a connection to the other. They pay their friends to de-list their enemy... thus depriving him potentially of hundreds of friends or more. Or they initiate the more vague, yet sinister, "flag for review." Hapless newbies who sign on to Friendster get their asses chewed off when they make the mistake of adding their office mate as a friend. Their crime? They've not brought enough friends with them and they're pulling down the "friends to connections" average. Email account spamming escalates to pitched battles. Jimmy Carter enters the fray as an honest broker but unwittingly gets drawn in when someone hacks his account and draws big teeth on his pictures. The UN steps in as a last minute peace gesture but France delays the vote, demanding proof that "friendster" is a real word. The battles destroy cities, rendering earth a vast wastela-- wait a minute, is this Battlefield Earth?
It's incredible, it's long... and I'm talking about the Memorial Day Weekend. And now... a little something I like to call Random Notes ... before I gently segue into the main business of the day. I'm behind on email answers... but this is what a long holiday weekend is for. Presumably. So I expect that within 24 hours, there will be a significantly smaller group of people put out with me. Found this page of urlLink mixes ... burned a couple of them before the trip on Friday and they made for great listening across the wide expanses of Ontario... and the potholes of Detroit. Speaking of potholes, Detroit's roads are indeed the crappiest in the US... or very close to it. My poor truck groans as I'm forced to drive over roadways that look like they were randomly bombed. Michigan allows trucks as heavy as a nuclear cooling tower on the roads and you can see the results after years of heavy use and no repair. After the near perfection of Ontario roads and the decent quality of the freeways around my city, it's always an eye-opener to take I-94 through Detroit. I arrived the border at 3pm Friday... shift change time for the Homeland Security folks at the gate. After 8 hours staring at Michigan drivers, the woman didn't even want to see my driver's license, much less my birth certificate or my smiling face. I could have been carrying 3 shoulder mount nuclear warheads, a brick of marijuana and anthrax in a baby's sippy cup-- it didn't matter. "Go ahead." OK... so another great weekend in Toronto. I spent most of the time reading-- newspapers, books-- which was the original plan. I got into the city just in time for the urlLink hockey game . I walked down Yonge for a block or two and went into the first restaurant where there was a TV. It was a sad night for urlLink Sens fans , but they had a great season and made a comeback to tie the Eastern Conference Finals at 3 games. Not a word about SARS from a couple acquaintances and the random strangers I encountered in Toronto. Yes, urlLink it's back . SARS II: Electric Boogaloo. There goes the economy again. Or maybe not. Maybe Americans and others won't get all fruity over a secondary outbreak that's pretty much confined just to a couple hospitals. Oh yes, and there's also a urlLink Mad Cow in Canada. And I'm not talking about urlLink Margaret Thatcher on book tour. My friend Matt and I were talking today about American friends who have warned us about going to Toronto, post-SARS. Matt suggests that they're not truly concerned about it-- or scared. He thinks it's the human fascination with the troubles of others... a kind of "verbal rubbernecking." Whatever, it is... we've had about enough of it. Saturday night, I met up with C. He suggested a drink; I suggested 9:30pm. I walked outside and he was there with his bike... 27, 5'9", 150lbs, dark hair, blue eyes, tan, a day's growth... oh you are so what's happening now . He lives in the Greek Village; speaks French and Japanese; has a masters in marketing; is considering further study in international relations; brilliant conversationalist; excellent chemistry; and did I mention muscle? Oh yeah, and he lives about 300 miles away. It's been a year since I met someone who blew me away the way he did. So last night, I had the time of my life... talking about architecture, urban planning, Canadian politics, George Bush, the Queen, the gay ghetto, the Matrix, sex, guys, love, monogamy, falafel. We were kind of like boyfriends... having sex, then prowling the streets for something good to eat at 2am, then back to talk till 3. Today, I have the memory. And a certain soreness; when I mentioned this to C this morning... he held up 4 fingers. Which explains a lot. So a great weekend... and there's still more to come. It's a working holiday on Monday... getting some work done for Tuesday and recreating all the research work I did during my last trip to Toronto... all of it wiped out by the hard drive crash. Well, hell, it's always easier the second time around isn't it?
This morning, NPR's Andrea Seabrook, explaining the Congressional approval of the tax cut, said the road to approval has been "twist-y." This marks the official beginning of the "-y" on America's public broadcaster. I predict that by next week, the CBC's Shelagh Rogers will say, "What's it all aboot? I've beeeeen feeling SARS-y." Gosh, I'm such an American... my knuckles are dragging on the ground. I'm working hard to maintain that my third trip to Toronto in four weeks is merely because I like to read the paper copy of the Globe and Mail. My friends aren't buying it. My fallback position (ala Ari Fleischer) is that my trip is boy-related but not boy-driven . I might as well have hired the Iraqi Information Minister. Yes, a boy does exist and coffee has been planned. urlLink Soblo also has at least one coffee date of his own on the roster. We single gay men must acount for a significant chunk of coffee sales. We should all switch to shade-grown. I promise not to say (much) more about the notebook. Software reinstallation is taking longer than usual, mainly because I'm doing things like writing this. But by tonight or tomorrow, most everything should be restored. There are losses... 10 days of "sent mail" which I'm obsessed with preserving, so that sucks. All the music I've downloaded since March, around 100 MB-- not much. Nearly my entire porn collection. It never would have been that big a loss except that my backup lapper's hard drive had crashed in March and I'd been slow in duplicating files like new music and porn on the backup machine. But, like a lot of guys, I kept the porn collection but over time, had pretty much stopped "consulting" it. So it's more nostalgia that makes me miss it. Life goes on... ... but not for some. The estimates of urlLink future growth of HIV in Russia are highly disturbing. Predictions can be wrong... but it's a reminder that urlLink 15 billion dollars is still just a drop in the bucket.
So I saw urlLink him again tonight at the bar. My ex and I were there, having dinner... and when I looked up, he was staring back at me from over at the bar. He has incredible eyes... the dark skin of someone with African-American and Latino heritage. I said hi as he walked by and watched him go to the upstairs bar. Last time, I sat downstairs feeling all conflicted. I'm so fucking shy that I can't go upstairs because I don't know what I'm supposed to say. So I left. This time, I figured I could leave... but it would be such a cop out. Dave played the good friend and went upstairs with me for a while, then took off. His name is Juan. He has beautiful eyes. He has a nice sense of humor, a lean, lightly muscled body, he's easygoing. But it's his eyes. When he pulls out a cigarette, I look in his eyes and they're smiling back at me. Puff. Fuck. Oh well... Monogamy/Open Relationship Redux Thanks to everyone for the email thoughts on the issue. I've received a lot more in the past day or so and there has been some good writing about the topic on other weblogs. The topic surfaces from time to time, but I think that's alright. It's worth taking the time to think about your own position... and the positions others have. But there's one thing that bothered me about all of this-- and I know it bothered some of you, too: the tone of defensiveness, moral superiority and occasionally outright belligerence from some who wrote. I suppose some gay men feel under attack for their stand, whatever it is. Others are quite smug about their choice. One reader wrote today: I felt attacked for not being 100% monogamous. It bothered me that people would think our relationship is somewhat less because we've had a few free radicals along the way. Maybe it's because I wouldn't consider thinking that about someone in a monogamous relationship. I don't think more or less of couples who agree to only have sex with one another. I just assume that that's what makes them happy or they wouldn't be in that particular relationship. I think if we're going to ask for tolerance and respect from society at large then we need to expect the same from each other. We have our own particular views on the issue... which we arrive at because of life experience, the way we were raised, etc. Then there's our partner, who has his own life experiences, needs and expectations. And then there's the dynamic between the two individuals. Some guys will always be monogamous; some will always pursue forms of open relationships; some will more open with one boyfriend, monogamous with the other-- the chemistry will determine what works. I've been in a rewarding monogamous relationship; in a troubled and dysfunctional one; in a difficult open relationship. My next relationship might be monogamous... or it might be one in which my boyfriend and I occasionally meet a third. Personally, I don't think one kind of relationship is better than the other. Whatever our choice, it's the result of the matrix of strengths and weaknesses we find in ourselves and in our partners. Let's choose wisely. That's the key for me... coming to an understanding of myself, learning from experience and avoiding past mistakes.
Gosh... is Thursday done yet? Tons of work today... while at the same time trying to restore my computer, It now has a working hard drive-- a temporary drive while the replacement ships here. Basically, I'm working with just the operating system at the moment, but by tonight, I should have the machine back to full speed. That is if I don't kill people first. I only have 2 hours of work left... but it will be non-stop work. So we press on. I also need to decide what I want to do for this weekend. I have a feeling there's going to be another cross border trip. More to come...
I'm still in a dark mood, trying to get around the loss of my laptop's hard drive yesterday. So if you want funny stuff, skip a couple paragraphs. I really will stop ranting in just a minute. I used to feel like I had to apologize for being so attached to the machine, but I don't anymore. Basically, I'm in front of it from 5am-12Midnight or later... with breaks for dinner, the gym and friends. All work I do is text-based, and Internet-driven... research, notes, scripts for broadcast, email, listening to music, writing. So while I lost very little, I'm stuck without the primary piece of machinery I need to work. I'm using a work laptop. It's carefully equipped-- by our crack(ed) sysadmin, with Windows NT 4.0. And who can forget Office 98? Ah yes... it's like Dick Clark has come to live at my house. I have a backup lapper... but as I've talked about before here... it's a Dell that, in 18 months, has nearly completely fallen apart. It runs fine... but the screen is dead. I could bring it to work, but the effort to dig up a monitor, etc isnt worth it. So, where are my files? Some are on my backup CD-ROM; some are on servers at the University of Michigan; some are on my Hotmail account. As I take notes for future interviews, write scripts, etc... I'm shuffling stuff from one place to another so what I do at home is available at work. My CD burner? Disabled with the main lapper. I'm not going to let it ruin my sunny disposition, though. LOL oh screw it, it already has. So let's have a few snickers. Chris writes: I must say, the upgraded alert status makes me happy. I feel so much more comfortable in orange…yellow just makes my skin look pallid. Another reader notes that porn star Ron Jeremy-- or should I say urlLink Khalid Shaik Mohammed -- was urlLink arrested and released right here in Ann Arbor last weekend. And I thought I had to move to the big city to enjoy porn star antics.
This has been a really hard day... but thanks to Ted in DC, Frank in Toronto, to urlLink you , urlLink you , urlLink you , urlLink you , and urlLink you for all the fun back and forth conversations today on a variety of topics that kept my mind occupied and off of more pressing problems. I'm going to call it a night early and get some work done and then get some sleep.
Lots of emails today about being monogamous or being open in a relationship. Here are some: from urlLink Bentkid : Making one person your exclusive sexual partner certainly is a complex subject, but I don't think it is something that you can be 'wrong' about -- it is something that you work out to the best of your emotional comfort at any given time, and for some people, it is something that is negotiable depending on the stage of the relationship. I don't have anything profound or insightful to say, really. I'm not built to be sexually monogamous, personally -- and I love my boyfriend more than I can say. But sex, perhaps more than other things because of the culture charge it carries, is an ideal issue to act out other emotional problems , and that is why folks like your ex-boyfriend wield it with such dexterity and with such painful results. I love men, and I love men's bodies -- I can't imagine walking away from the pleasures and excitements of the guys who share their bodies with me. I also can't imagine living my life without my partner, and know that emotional and physical access to one person to the exclusion of others is a powerful way to live an affective life. I understand why folks want that arrangement. from a reader: I am a gay man and have been in a relationship for the past 10 yrs now and yes it has been a monogamous one because for me that’s the only kind that I could be in. I was not raised as you in a very conservative home but was raised in a home with Christian values. I believe that a man can be gay, Christian, and have strong moral values and can control his desires to have multiple sexual partners. I don’t believe that being gay is a choice but I do believe that being gay we can make a lot of different choices in life. another reader: I'm not at all sympathetic to people who demand an "open" relationship. It's just an excuse for being self-indulgent and, if I may be blunt, trampy. Most of the people I know who've gone this direction have used sex for self-validation : I must be worthwhile and exciting because so many people want to sleep with me! Pretty shallow. If "maturity" means spending yourself on a series of quickies and short-term hook-ups, I suppose I will never be able to claim that particular adjective as my own. I have nothing whatsoever against fooling around with friends or satisifying curiosities when you're single, but if you are going to go to the trouble of establishing a relationship with someone I think you at least owe them the courtesy of sleeping only with them. huh, I have more than 2 readers: I find it hard to comprehend why anyone would ever need to look outside of their relationship for quick gratification. Call me old fashioned, or old at any rate, but looking for that quick fix says to me that there is something not quite right within the relationship. I personally like the idea of familiarity with my partners body. I have had two long term relationships, the first when I was 19 with a man 14 years older which lasted 7 years, and my last with a man 10 years younger which ended in 1999. Both were truly wonderful and I learned so much about myself with each one. Being single again has defintely presented challenges to me, but I am sure that there is someone out there waiting for me. another reader email pours in: Why do we, as gay men, feel a need to apologize for believing in monogamy? We don't feel we're wrong, but when we voice our opinion we feel we must add so many disclaimers so as not to appear.......what?.......old-fashioned, uptight, close-minded....Well there aren't many open relationships that seem to make it-in fact opening them seems to be the beginning of the end. Which is why they are probably opened in the first place--nothing left here but can't find the courage to end it, or possibly can't spend the intellectual currency to figure out what one wants, and doesn't want. People should do what they feel is best for them, but this desire to have everything--faithful lovers, boyfriends, parties, etc.- is far too prevalent today . Especially in the gay community. And what is best gets so clouded, especially for young people, when so much of what one hears is the virtues of open relationships. At 47 years old and having worked in the gay community for most of those years, it makes one wonder sometimes. urlLink addaboy , with whom I've had a few discussions about uninhibited sex: Having fun is one thing, but having someone is so much better. I too am not comfortable being around people that don't agree with that. _____________________________ Alright... I've "bolded" a few comments above that I think are worthy of more thought. I don't necessarily agree with them but they're interesting turns of argument. urlLink Bentkid has hit on an important point with this idea of sex being the space in which we act out a number of emotional issues. In a piece that Inter |textual has urlLink written for today , this idea is also present: the failure of a relationship where monogamy was an issue, causing us to pursue a different kind of sexual life afterward. Both of those related ideas are worth more thought. While I'm thinking about it... no one wrote to talk about couples who have threesomes or whatever, but always within the context of their relationship. I've known, and been involved with, a couple of solid, long-lasting relationships of this type. But I have no personal experience with that arrangement, so I won't write about it. I will, however, offer up a couple ideas that represent my thinking at precisely this moment. What I think a couple hours from now will probably be different in some way. But we're human and we have the luxury of being able to change our minds. First of all, I think there is something ideal about the monogamous relationship and I think it's something great to strive for. If I loved someone and he wanted monogamy, I might discuss the issue but I could live happily within that construct. If I could choose in a perfect world, though, I would be in a relationship where there was the availability of something else occasionally. Like Bentkid, I would love my boyfriend and the sexual and emotional life I would build with him would be unique. But I like men and I like men's bodies and the sharing of that kind of energy. In an ideal relationship, I wouldn't close off the possibilities for either one of us to experience that. I might prefer that it be a third person that my boyfriend and I hang out with together. Relationships, of course, aren't ideal... and we bring our emotional scars and experiences and fears and needs to the table and they mix with the scars and experiences and fears and needs that our partner brings. Some stews allow for exotic flavoring; other mixes do best as they are, without any added flavors.
Gosh, I must not have anything to do if I can spend more than half an hour writing testimonials for people I know on Friendster. In fact, for as busy as I should be right now, I'm not accomplishing a damn thing. Yes, and I'm loving every minute of it. Burnout-- or whatever this is that I've had for months-- leaves me hot and cold. I have periods where I'm immensely productive... followed by long periods where only the important work gets finished-- and then only at the last minute. I stop for a minute and close my eyes and within 10 seconds a curtain drops and I know that at that moment, I could fall asleep for several hours... wake up and feel good... and not have accomplished a single thing. Or I could lay back down and sleep for hours more. Looking for... 1) Does anyone have a digital copy of a tune called "Wayback" by Hubtone? It's on Repap records and opened the latest edition of urlLink The Blue Room on urlLink Radio 1 . urlLink Listen to it ... I like it-- the tune and the show. I'm also a big fan of Dance Anthems, but urlLink Jockohomo turned me on to Blue Room. 2) What about a digital copy of the first trailer for the original "Matrix" movie? Specifically, I'm looking for a .wav or mp3 of the voice saying "What is the Matrix?" If you have either... email me and thanks! I was walking down the street Saturday night... wondering why it is that I like cities so much. And it was moments later that the odor hit me full on and I knew. It's diesel and car fumes and the subterranean odor of the subway wafting up through the ventilation grates from below. At moments like that, the part of me that luxuriates in the (relatively) clean air of the Colorado Rockies retreats and the city part of me feels at home. Which is weird because I grew up in a small town. But some people are happy with small town or small city life... and I'm not. It doesn't matter that I've never lived in a city larger than 150,000 people. You know how it is when you're someplace and it's foreign to you in most every way, but yet it feels like home? This is how I am in New York City... but even more so in smaller cities like Chicago, Toronto and Washington DC. I dropped into a Starbucks, got a cup of coffee, pulled out my Palm and started scribbling. Among the scribbles... I like looking at a sea of unusual and unfamiliar faces. I feel a sense of safety in the city. Maybe it's the safety of being one of many. It's certainly the safety of anonymity. I love sitting next to someone on the subway and not having any idea who they are. I like close contact with strangers. I can appreciate the superficiality of those moments. And I know that moments like that can also lead to more. The point is, the choice is yours. To be inaccessible or accessible is entirely up to you. I don't know why that's invigorating to me but it is. I lose a lot of the general-- at times, crippling-- shyness I feel in other places. The city gives me an unexpected confidence. I don't know how soon it is that I'll move on. It might be a few more years. It might be this fall. Who knows when? But the city calls me. It has for years but now the call is louder than ever. The Monogamy/Open Relationship issue has already resulted in several emails and thoughts from readers and bloggers. I'm putting some of them together for a piece that I'll post by tomorrow.
I have fetishes for the following: long hair, persians, blondes, sephardic hebrew speakers, older guys, flushed cheeks, and business suits.
If you missed Inter |textual's urlLink "My Attempts at Being an Escort" then you should click through right now and read it. (If you read several of his pieces before you come back here, I won't mind and you'll be the better for it.) It's a piece on a subject that I've wanted to write about for a long time and couldn't. Inter |textual's unique life experience gives him a great perspective on being a one-man man. My experience was simpler... trying to make an open relationship work because it was what my boyfriend wanted, and I felt like I owed it to him to give him the freedom. And let's face it... the other reason-- probably the bigger reason-- was that I was afraid I would lose him so I thought I had to give in. In the end, we lost each other anyway because we couldn't find a spark between us-- something that was probably unrelated to being open or not. But when we were together, being "open" sapped the life out of the relationship. I dreaded the looks he gave other guys... the advances he made toward them... the things real and imagined that happened between them. I blamed myself for not trusting his promise to honor "what was important" in our relationship. I thought I was a lesser man because I was making sex too important. After it all, it was only sex. Last fall, I wrote briefly about a dream I had about my boyfriend of the time. Almost six months after breaking up, those images remain etched with a remarkable clarity. In fact, even now, they're jeopardizing our friendship. Reading Inter |textual's piece urlLink "Betrayal" is like a slap in the face. I'm not sure why these images and words are so painful-- except that they might be so that I won't forget them the next time I begin a relationship. This hits upon an area that I still feel deeply uncertain about. I won't disrespect anyone else's decision on the issue of monogamy or being in an open relationship. I respect my ex-boyfriend and his decision because I understand the complexities of his situation even as I retain my personal view. But until I come to a better, more cogent, perhaps less emotional conclusion, the relationship I'm in has to be monogamous. It may be my failing or immaturity and if it is, I'm willing to accept that. The central issue, for me, is this: sex means something. It's an animal act that transcends our animal nature. The animal takes from the other... the human gives as well as takes. Hook-up sex means something-- otherwise we wouldn't be as careful as we are about who we hook-up with. In my current situation as a single guy, I amaze myself how long I'll talk to an online hook-up prospect trying to gauge what kind of a person they are. If I was having them over just to engage in an act, I wouldn't bother... and neither would you. If a guy was nothing more than a mechanical dick-insertion machine, I wouldn't watch him interact with others as long as I do before I make that first awkward approach from across the bar. If we were animals, having sex regularly with a friend wouldn't mean more than a one-time hook-up, even if the hook-up guy was totally hot. And yet if you have that kind of a situation with a friend or f*ckbud whatever you want to call him, you know that there's something truly cool about the familiarity of the skin, the lips, the moves. And just as that is the case, then there's what I consider to be the pinnacle-- the relationship with the one person... the one for all time? Well, maybe... who can say? Does a sexual relationship existing at one level-- even the pinnacle -- rule out the possibility of another sexual relationship co-existing at another level? No. As a single man, I'm capable of having a variety of sexual relationships that take different places on the ladder of importance. But inside me, something happens when we talk about that pinnacle of a dating relationship. For me, there's something different that rules out the possibilities for other relationships. Why? I don't know. Is it the hetero-sexist hegemony? Is it tradition trying to stifle me? I don't know. I truly don't. I won't pretend that I have an answer. At least twice in the past, I've started a journal entry on this topic and erased it. All I know is what I feel about the issue of monogamy. And I'll admit my own discomfort with just about any other position on the spectrum. And I admit my personal dissatisfaction with this journal entry, which simplifies my personal views and makes them more absolute and concrete than they are. OK, I'll leave this alone for now and let the ideas percolate for awhile... and then tackle it again and see if anything new pops up.
This will get your weekend off to a good start... a urlLink stomach-turning (or tongue-twisting) contribution from my friend Ted in DC. It makes my eyes water. :) Roaming the international papers this morning... the urlLink National Post has a good piece on urlLink Leo Strauss ... the intellectual father of neo-conservatives. Did he support democracy or did he prefer the elitist cabal? Probably a bit of both. It was good reading over coffee this morning and a reminder that newspapers occasionally do quality magazine style writing. (Am I really being this nice about the National Post?) The article also mentions that Allan Bloom, a Straussian and author of "Closing of the American Mind" was a closeted gay man. I wasn't aware of this... but once again, a man with deeply conservative, some might say backward, social ideas who secretly liked men. hmmm... I also liked the piece on urlLink this woman who has apparently become one of the better agents at rooting out muslim terror organizations... and the charities based in the US and Canada that fund them. She's written a book about how work... albeit anonymously. No pieces from the NY Times today... haven't picked up the paper yet.
I won't say a lot about it because others will... and besides, almost everyone of us is going to see it either this weekend or very soon-- if you haven't seen it already. I like the story development. The fight sequences are still fun, but they're so long and built up so much that it's almost numbing. The reviews have been right when they've complained about the ratcheting up of the fight sequences. It's hard to outdo the brilliance of the first movie, but simply adding tons of more guys to fight isn't the answer. So there are moments of pure ballet during the fighting but it's much more rare than it was the first time around. Maybe I feel that way because I can still feel the thrill that I felt the first time I saw The Matrix. It's a special movie and so I'm willing to overlook the flaws of the second one. I'll see it again... maybe this weekend or maybe back home with friends. I do have to say this: I saw it at the Uptown Theater here in Toronto, which has a huge screen. It also had what has to be one of the best prints of a film that I've ever seen. Some theaters are playing films off of hard drives; this was definitely film but it was an amazingly clean print. Alright I'm off... more tomorrow.
Did I say this was a working vacation ? Officially, it's become a vacation . Fuck it... I'm going to lunch and then to "Mighty Wind." Work can wait. My friend Ted just wrote from DC that he didn't think it was as funny as "Best in Show." I loved that movie! Anyway... umbrella fully tested... Palm synced... later.
Well, I finally broke down and bought an umbrella today. Yes, capitulation in the face of the weather system that seems to be covering a big chunk of the continent. This after the morning's journey to get the paper. The hotel gives me one paper... but I'm addicted to the New York Times. So I took off down the street... aiming for this newsstand about 4 blocks away that sells the Times. There's this wonderful Indian woman there whom I met and talked to yesterday. The problem is, 4 blocks on a rainy day isn't fun. But I walked there, hunched over, sweatshirt hood engaged. Closed. I turn around and walk back up the street toward the Starbucks where I'd planned to read. There's a convenience mart across the street so I zip over. They have the Post but not the Times. I pick up the Post. Ok, now I have two papers under my arm... both good ones, but not the one I want. As I'm about to reach Starbucks, my eye wanders across the street and there, one block from my hotel is a newsstand, which yes... sells the Times. I won't add up how many blocks I walked because of my lack of powers of observation. But I did buy an umbrella. I've always had this thing about umbrellas. I don't like them. When it rains, I endure... assuming it will stop soon. Yes, that's a truism; what goes up will also come down, by the way. But sometimes you have to endure much before the rain stops. A few years ago, I was spending a week in Washington, DC... anchoring the urlLink network news. The remnants of a hurricane hit the city and for 2 days there was little but hard, driving rains and high winds. I was staying in a hotel about 3 blocks from network headquarters. Close enough that you feel funny engaging a cab... but far enough for you to get very wet walking over. Oh, and I was also reporting to work at 3am, so it wasn't easy to get a cab anyway. It was about 4 minutes of pure misery followed by about an hour of drying out. No umbrella. Decided... I'm going to see "A Mighty Wind" today at 1pm and "Matrix: Reloaded" at 7:30pm tonight. I approach medication in the same way as I do umbrellas. Is this suprising? Yes, there's a pattern. But I've been quite diligent (for the last 2 days) at taking Ibuprofin. The doctor wants me to take 800 mg a day to reduce the inflammation in my shoulder. And it seems to be working. I'm scheduled to see a sports medicine specialist about it in June... but the pills have helped a lot already. Interesting stuff from the papers today... A report that won't do much to erase urlLink concerns about maintenance at nuclear power plants; Reagan began the highly orchestrated approach to media events... but urlLink Bush II has perfected it ; a disturbing piece on the urlLink ignored conflict in the Congo.
Or is it capit a l? Day dawns brightly after a long, deep and uninterrupted sleep. Except to wake at exactly 4:45am to remind myself that, no, I don't have to get up at the crack of dawn today. So it was back to sleep until the more civilized 8am. Now coffee'd, reasonably newspapered and walked... I'm ready to get to work. I'm writing the treatment for a 13-part series on healthy aging for baby boomers. For baby boomers, I might add, who are buying big fat value meals at McDonalds, haven't exercised since they put the broken Thighmaster in the garbage, and who buy bigger pants every year. But PBS cares... and so I'm going to develop the baseline subjects and content to be covered in the series, which I'll co-host.. and figure out an NPR-type component for radio... all for a few hunded dollars a day. If I was doing this solely for radio, I'd have been allowed to turn in my receipts for the coffee and the newspaper for reimbursement. But TV is a different ball of wax. I first became aware of this a couple years ago. I was one of the hosts for a big event on TV. It was one of those giant extravaganzas; the set was incredible; about $100,000 spent on backdrops, anchor desk, lighted, spinning globe... those "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" rotating spotlights. Anyway, I fly to Washington, DC, and am met at the airport by a limo and a driver. I'm put up at one of the best hotels. Everything is covered. I'm called the talent ; in radio, we're never called talent. We're called many other things. But not talent. TV revolves around the talent . How does the talent feel about the dressing room? Is the talent hungry? Is the talent comfortable? I love standing next to the director and the producers and camera people and hear myself called talent; I'm not Todd... I'm the tool.. the face. And this is the other side of it, I think. The talent think they're special... and they are because they are the face of the production. They're chosen for specific reasons... looks, intelligence (occasionally), poise, smile, flare, personality, etc. But talent hides the other side, too. Talent are the tool of the directors and producers. We're the implements of the production; important implements certainly, but like any tool, you can always go buy another one if you break the one that you have. This is why I smile whenever I'm around full-time TV people who think they're the shit. You may be the big time Live Eye roving correspondent on 7 Action News... but in reality, you're nothing more than a screwdriver or a hammer or a wrench. They are a hundred other pretty people like you, ready to replace you at a moments notice. So why do I do TV at all if I'm such a cynic? Because it's a lark! It's like playtime for me. I'm building skills at it... learning the ropes... and that's a cool thing, particularly at this point in my career when I've been on the radio almost every day since I was 14 years old. I haven't learned everything about radio but I've learned a lot so at 35, it's nice to explore something else that's familiar and new at the same time and presents all sorts of new challenges. Like talking and smiling at the same time. Drives me crazy. Making a joke and laughing but then laughing directly at the camera; on the radio you can laugh and your eyes can do whatever they want because you're voice is the homing beacon for the listener. But on TV, your eyes are the beacon and just as on radio I use my voice to keep the listener locked, on TV I have to use my eyes to lock the viewer in and give her a frame of reference. It's a very interesting concept to me-- the science of television-- and a difficult one for someone like me who is very shy-- even in front of an impersonal $50,000 camera. Which reminds me... I have to get my teeth done. This is something you don't have to think about on radio. But you can see bad teeth on TV. And the work we do now is in high definition, so you can practically count the pores on my skin. My parents couldn't afford braces when I was a kid. So now it's up to me,I guess. Gawd, I hate TV. Did I mention that I might go to Russia this summer to do a high-def documentary in St. Petersburg? I love TV!
Called urlLink addaboy the other night... mainly to hear his sexy voice. We talked about boys, dating, relationships and friends. Check out his urlLink Thursday 5/15 post because it's a good piece and I'm using it as a jumping off point for mine. I think few gay guys meet and start a friendship without the possibility of something more looming over them. I'm not sure why that is, or if this also happens a lot in the straight world. But think about it; our friends tend to be good looking; a lot of our friends have similar interests, some shared values-- the same ingredients of a dating relationship. I suppose it's only natural to make a new friend and then wonder -- even briefly-- if there's the possibility of something more. Particularly if we find the guy sexually attractive. Is he hot? Does he look like he's packing a big one in there? I've been in this situation a couple times. You start dating and you have good times together, great sex. But as addaboy says, after 2 or 3 months it's lost its specialness. You discover that there's no spark and you're basically behaving as friends toward each other. Maybe friends with benefits but still friends. My friend Dan and I have talked about this, too... and here's my take on it. (I'll spare Dan just in case this doesn't fully represent his point of view.) Many single gay men pursue a rather strict delineation between friends and sex partners-- boyfriends or f*ckbuds. If we're friends with X, we're not going to have sex with him because that would be crossing the line. But what's the difference in the end if you try dating X for a couple months, have a lot of good sex, but discover he's really just friend material, not the love of your life? What if-- during that 3 months-- you still went to the same restaurants with X, saw the same movies, laughed at each other's jokes, traded gossip, argued over politics, didn't date... but had sex? If a lot of our unsuccessful dating is mainly a desire to have sex with a sexy new friend, then what's wrong with two friends consenting to have sex with each other? If it gets weird, that's because of the personal dynamics involved and maybe you should stop. But I think if you both know what you're doing, there's little chance of weirdness. Am I advocating having sex with all your friends? No... none of us has the time necessary, nor probably the stamina, for that kind of performance. Some of our friends aren't that hot. Might the two of you discover that you both want to go further down the dating path? Maybe... so do it. I bet a lot of these situations don't go beyond the friend stage. But some of those guys you have a good time with-- out and about... and in bed with-- can become remarkably close friends. Personally, I'm not quite willing to say this was the case with D and I. Mainly because we tried many times before mutually discovering that we were best as friends. I think we tried so much because there was a spark there... neither of us was ever able to pin it down and go with it, though. Would we have done better staying just as friends and having a little fun? Probably. Is every failed relationship going to be the result of this? No. The more I get used to my gay life, the less need I see for strict barriers between friends and more. There have been guys I've met whom I've been attracted to... enjoyed immensely as friends... never dated... but have had great sex with. Sex shouldn't be a substitute for intimacy.. but healthy sex with a friend can deepen the imtimate bond that you have. In the same way that the ex with whom you remain friends always seems to know you better than other friends. He's seen you at your most vulnerable. To quote once again one of my former boyfriends and now closest friends, "I've licked your ass." _________________________ I feel strange ending an entry with the words "licked your ass." So I'll ramble on a little more; that will push the naughtiness in a bit so it's not hanging out there. urlLink Soblo printed his horoscope today. He's all hard and oak-like. I looked up urlLink mine , and read this: Just in time for zero hour, Leo, I'm happy to add a new term to your vocabulary: kairos. It's Greek for "time of destiny, critical turning point, propitious moment for decision or action." Since you're at that exact phase in your cycle, I thought you'd be ripe to learn the word for it. Here are further subtleties you might be interested in. Kairos refers to a special season that's charged with significance and in a sense outside of normal time; its opposite is chronos, which refers to the drone of the daily rhythm. When you're in kairos, you have the power and duty to act like the sovereign of a sacred land. If you've read some of the stuff I've been writing lately, you'll know why I'm reprinting this. There's a big conference going on this week in the industry I work in. On Saturday, there will be a presentation on how radio stations can be more successful at keeping audiences listening after 9am when morning drive is over. The key to listener retention is the quality of the morning drive service... and a new study to be released Saturday shows my version of the morning drive show is a top performer. In fact, it's the top performer in the country in retaining audience for up to 2 hours afterward. You know what? I'm gonna have dessert tomorrow, too. Here it is 10:30pm, I'm on vacation and I'm damn near ready to fall asleep. No big deal... I didn't come here to spend every night at the clubs... or even any nights at the clubs, necessarily. I came out to do a little work during the day and relax at night. I've relaxed. I worked, went out and bought some clothes for summer, had great sex (it's vacation right?), had a big Italian dinner including the virtually unheard of dessert (again, vacation) and walked around checking out the sites. Now, I'm going to open up a urlLink good book and let the Marriott lull me to sleep.
Busy day... precisely the kind of day where I should be leaving the weblog until later tonight when I have more time. But it's always precisely the time when I feel like spending a few minutes saying something, even if it's nothing at all. I had a big interview on military strategy this morning at 10am; I have another major interview on Iran at 12:15pm; And, most important, I just had a 6-inch turkey breast on wheat, no cheese, from Subway. Today, featuring red onions rather than the standard white ones. hmmm quite upscale. Accidental? Or new strategy? Life is getting tougher all the time... should I choose Newman's Own dressing at McDonalds or the much-talked about red onions at Le Subway? My computer is running hot today-- the fan keeps turning on; but then I guess that I've also been running hot lately... libido set to high. urlLink You're not helping. I'm all packed and ready for travelling today. I'm looking forward to a few days away and time to focus on work-- but especially on relaxation. As usual, I'm taking 4 books to read, as if I can read all four of them in 4 days. But it's nice to have options! I'll write more once I arrive later today.
Hey Todd... how's the day going so far?" "Good!" "Anything going on?" "Well, I lost one of my workout gloves and couldn't find it when I got to the gym. It was my favorite pair." "Ah, well... that's too bad." "Then I found it when I got home. It had fallen out of my bag last night." "Ah..." "I didn't really need them today because it's leg day but it was still weird not being able to wear them." "..." "I'm glad I didn't have to buy a new pair because these are my favorite gloves." "um... I gotta go... someone on the other line. See ya."
I haven't written anything here about Mother's Day... not that there's much I want to say about it, frankly. Actually, I did write something for here... finished it and was proofreading it when my system had a hardware crash and deleted the file. I think it was telling for two reasons: first, I was typing it directly into the Blogger interface without saving it, which is unusual for me; and second, I haven't had a hardware crash in weeks and weeks. So, the piece is gone and instead of re-creating it, I'm content to let sleeping dogs lie. Maybe it was a sign of some kind. D told me last night that he thinks I'm harboring a lot of anger about my parents' response to the coming out thing two years ago... and other issues from growing up. I'm willing to agree that there's anger, but I'm not certain what to do about it. I don't feel anger in the visceral way that most people do. I don't raise my voice or throw things or whatever when I get mad. And I don't think that primal scream therapy or some similar exercise to "get it out" is going to be what I need. Therapy seems highly unnecessary, too. I don't know what I need, but I also know I'm not near some collapse; I'm happy with life and I have a lot of open opportunities right now, which I suppose saps the urgency from the situation. So on Friday, D had suggested that we go to dinner on Sunday night-- his treat. Fine with me. We often go to the bar to watch Six Feet Under and Queer As Folk. We get back from his family gathering around 8pm on Sunday and he takes a shower... then proceeds to put on a pair of dress khaki's, a sheer shirt and a blue blazer. Here I am in a pair of cargo pants (why yes, my A cargo pants, thanks for asking) and a casual blue shirt. "What's with the fancy get-up? We're going to hang out at the bar, right?" D: "Nothing. I felt like wearing something a little nicer." Todd: "I thought we were just going to hang out." Well, that's what I thought because D made it sound like it was going to be something that was a "D and Todd" thing. But, in fact, this wasn't the case. He had his own agenda for the evening-- his hook up thing or whatever-- and I was filler until the other plans kicked in. So fuck it... I stayed home. He wouldn't consider our time there to be filler-- and on one level he's right. But the clothes set the agenda, know what I mean? And as Chris said, "I suppose he just figured he could kill two birds with one stone – hang with you and pick-up a boy. The thing is that cruising requires that you ditch the person you're with, so he had to have known that he would be leaving you out in the cold. I think the fact that he didn’t try and encourage you to go, probably means that his intent was to cruise around…" And I guess that's what I had the problem with; not with anything he chooses to do... but with being made to think one thing when his intent was really another. I don't feel like making a big deal about it but I guess it was a lesson for me. This is a common practice of his-- one I seen often in the last 2 years that I've known him-- wrapping one agenda inside another. I don't think it's a bad thing necessarily, but it's easy to get caught in those moments when the curtain drops and you see the role you're playing. This makes him sound more manipulative than he is-- that's not an accurate representation of him... but I can't think of better words right now and this is my journal, right? He can get his own. :) Behind my back, people talk negatively about D. A lot of people do. Over the past few months, I've gleaned from idle conversation all kinds of remarks that point to this sentiment. Even close friends feel this way but getting it out of them requires pulling teeth. It's not as simple as saying, "He is a bad person." Because he's not at all. He's really quite an incredible person. I think the more true statement is that D, in some ways that I'm starting to understand better, is a bad person for me. I'm not sure what that means actually, and it's not a sweeping statement. We certainly know that we were a bad combination for dating. And time has a way of showing the other ways in which we were bad for each other. We always have been good for each other as friends. But I think I need to take the lead more in defining what "friends" means in regard to him. urlLink addaboy ... you are one hot man. How's that for a non sequitur ?
... what the second thing was that I was going to write about this morning. Typical. I'm just like that scene from Monty Python... "I'll give you two reasons." And then you get three... or maybe one... or four... but not two. I met this boy this weekend. But I've already determined that I'm going to give him a lot of shit. For this reason: he's outside of the accepted Todd demographic. He's young. Not unacceptably young... but younger than guys whom I usually find myself interested in. Seriously, I'm not giving him shit. I do notice that I'm more skeptical of him and any possibilities... merely because of his age. But, he's smart, cute, has nice eyes, seems to know what he wants from life. And so we keep talking. Who knows... maybe in a couple years when he's old enough to drive we might go out on a date. Ah yes... nothing like humor that borders on pedophilia to perk up a Monday. btw... he reads this... which means that the person getting a lot of shit is going to be me . A wet, windy, cold Monday. Yesterday, we had winds gusting upwards of 50 miles per hour. Branches were everywhere... dogs the size of large chew toys were flying down the street... people lost electricity. Not that this is unusual in Michigan. Since I've moved here, I've discovered that losing electricity in Michigan is commonplace. It rains, the power goes out. It snows, the power goes out. The Pistons lose, the power goes out. And when it does, it seems like it takes a week to get it back on. This isn't much of an obstacle for the true Michiganian. He just grabs his gun, shoots something moving, skins it and rubs a few sticks together to make a fire. A friend of mine: "It must look like the Early Man Exhibit at the Smithsonian." Me: "Ah, so you have been to Muskegon." I live downtown in Ann Arbor. I think our lines are buried because the power almost never even blinks down here. The wheels of commerce must keep turning.
A couple things as the week starts. First of all, it's a short week-- three days of work and then a couple days off. This isn't exactly true because I'll have a load of work to do for a client-- the research and writing kind of stuff. But it'll seem like time off, I hope, because I'll go somewhere else to do it. I'll be out of town Wednesday through Sunday if I play my cards right. I've got some good options for travel-- DC, Chicago and Toronto-- all of which would be great places to spend a few days. Anywhere but Michigan, which is windy and cold and wet! Did I say I was going to talk about a couple things? Well... the other thing-- whatever it was-- will have to wait until after the workout.
I searched this out after checking out urlLink Jimbo 's urlLink early webpage . Here's an example of my "blog before blog" from a very early version. God... it's fucking awful. :) If you start to feel lightheaded... reach for the oxygen masks which will drop from the ceiling... Thursday 11/20/97 Well... another quiet day in A2... cloudy, drizzly and rainy. I'm slowly but surely catching up on sleep... although I still get to 3pm and find myself getting really tired. I hate napping, though... Sean has a cold... or some form of icky-ness, which means I'm not getting to see him as much as I'd like... but I wish him the best! Speaking of cool friends... my friend Chad is on a job interview today... Best of Luck!!!!!!! I've been spending the last few days just laying low. I'm a people kind of guy... so I feel strange doing it... but I'm also sort of recharging my batteries after all the events of the past 3 weeks. A lot has happened... and there are a lot of emotions flying around inside right now. I hate having things unresolved... and right now I have some major (in my mind) unresolved issues with close friends. Nothing to threaten friendships.. but important stuff nonetheless. And then there's Sean. For the past 2 weeks, I've sort of been hiding away as it were in Sean... spending a lot of time with him and trying to get to know him better. It's been a wonderful, quiet, pleasant, necessary time. It's been very strengthening. It's also affected the time I spend with other friends like Keith, Chad, Tim... I could go on and on with that list. I'm trying to find my bearings... frankly this is the first time I've dated someone who I really want to spend time with (is that an admission or what?) and I'm trying to adjust my commitments. And btw... I have the coolest friends in the world. And I don't say that lightly, either... Oh... some of you have asked whether I get my mail at Caribou. :) No... but I'm working on it! I've added a new routine... the morning beverage at 9:15am along with bagels. Mmmmm... Caribou.... Slap my butt and call me Britney.
How cool to wake up to a thunderstorm! It's been a while... but I woke up this morning to an incredible lightning storm. I went out on the roof of my building to watch it for a while. It was that kind of lightning that spreads like veins across the sky. It's one thing about Michigan. I think we don't get the best lightning storms here... but this one was worth getting up for. The storm drifted to the east and I went back in to bed. And on an early Saturday at about 6am, that's exactly where I belonged. Someone else should have been there with me... but all in due time. :) My regular gym was closed today for spring cleaning. I'm not sure what that means because whenever I'm there, they're always vacuuming, wiping something down or just generally tidying up. You'd think it was Hong Kong at the height of SARS. Of course, something has to give... and one of the toilets in the men's locker rooms regularly doesn't work. Maybe they could fix that today. Anyway, my gym has three locations, so I went to one of the other ones instead for my bicep/tricep workout. It was kind of weird. Each of their gyms has a distinctive flavor; the one I go to is the musclehead gym. Almost all the equipment is geared toward lifting, with aerobics machines stuffed in the corner. The resulting demographic is a group of (mainly) guys who are pretty serious about working out. It has a large gay clientele... and while all of us know each other... it's hardly what you'd call a cruisy gym. We're there to work. The gym I went to today is mainly for aerobics equipment; us dumbbell boys get the corner. Well, I can deal with that-- at least for a day. But it was weird to lift there... for a reason that I can't explain. I travel regularly and work out at other gyms, so I'm used to different arrangements. Who knows why this time it felt different. I put in about an hour on the guns and then made for the exit. Talking with urlLink SeanT about gyms in Toronto today, I remembered my first time working out at the New York Sports Club in Chelsea. I don't think I've ever been so embarrassed about undressing in a locker room-- not even back in high school when I was the speech/drama/band/orchestra/chorus geek among the wrestlers. As far as I could tell, all working out stopped the moment anyone walked into the gym; all eyes would latch on to the newcomer, assessing him, approving or disapproving of his body, hair, workout clothes, shoes. The locker room was a runway. Guys would emerge from the showers wearing a towel, and when they reached the entrance to the locker room, they would dramatically take it off and walk to their locker naked. It was one of those moments where I was reminded that gay men can be such... well let's not let this rant go any further. My "don't give me any shit" week is over. But while I'm on the topic of gyms and gay men... check out this story of urlLink "Gym Etiquette" by urlLink Cucalambe . I'm listening to urlLink Evanescence "Bring Me To Life" right now. For some reason it's been on my mind all day... probably because I heard it on urlLink 89X twice today while driving around. It must be all that Christian music I listened to as a kid that makes their lyrics appealing to me. I like the sound... kind of like Linkin Park. If you didn't see this urlLink interview with the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , it's a must read. The man has been the subject of more than 500 investigations and cases against him in the last decade. Is this because he's corrupt? No, he's persecuted. Why? Because leftist forces are arrayed against him, the only man who can save Italian democracy. Italians love him, he says. Perhaps true... but it's rare to have someone present himself in such a puffed-up way to the international press. And in what has become the bizarre story of the week... urlLink the case of the airplane accident over the Congo on Thursday . Apparently, the cargo doors opened in-flight, de-pressurizing the cabin and maybe sucking more than a hundred passengers out of the plane. But how it happened, when it happened, how many were on board the plane and how many might have died are all mysteries. The urlLink Toronto Globe and Mail reports that " The defence ministry of Ukraine, which owns the plane, denied that anyone had been hurt and said that no cargo was lost." Yesterday, some officials in the Congolese government were denying that anyone was hurt. Some said 7 people died. Others said 130. hmmm... maybe we can just split the difference? urlLink The New York Times notes that "The confusion around the circumstances of the accident and the death toll resurrected memories of a ferry disaster in Senegal last fall. Initially, the death toll was placed around 800. It crept up to 1,200 some months later. The official number, coming nearly five months later, placed the number at 1,863, making it the second worst maritime disaster in history."
The new urlLink Palm is here. I played around with it for a while tonight... often just clicking buttons and watching how fast things displayed. The screen is the brightest one I've seen... and the camera is rudimentary but fun. I urlLink posted one of the first pics I took with it. Well... another Friday night... another Friday night to hit the sack early. A long and fruitful week and I'm ready for bed!
I won't dare go into greater detail... but my body has reminded me of the fact that I tested 20 different kinds of salsa last night. hmmm... we move on. Had a Sweet Onion Teryaki Chicken sub at Subway today for lunch. I get one of those once a week because I like the taste of the sauce. Who wouldn't? It's basically pure sugar. And the sweetness is a nice juxtaposition to plenty of jalapenos. This is no sub to be eating on the go. I find that I end up with about as much sauce on me as there is on the sandwich. So, I had a 12-incher for lunch and then promptly took a shower. Which is what I've been doing every three hours since I got back from Toronto. I just noticed tonight that several of my friends aren't kissing me. I wonder if I'll be quarantined for ten days? No gay greeting kisses for you, Todd. Not until you prove to us that you're SARS-free. I'm not the least bit concerned, but I feel like I have to be seen washing my hands or something... just to prove my cleanliness. I took a sip of wine out of a friend's glass tonight during my latest 4 hour talk/hang out binge at the local gay bar and grill. But he didn't get all weird, so good for him! Reminds me of one of my exes, whom I love dearly. Once last year, we were at his parents and he wanted me to try a drink he had made and I told him I would get another glass since I had a slight cold. He said, "Come on... I've licked your ass, for Christ's sake." hmmm... point taken. At this moment, it seems apropos to reprint urlLink Addaboy's Quote of the Month: "You ever cone him?" "Cone him?" "As in ice cream cone him? You get him up on all fours and start chowing down from behind. You're holding his cock like a big ass ice cream cone (you hope) and there you are licking away trying to get every god damn sprinkle off that sundae." ____________________________________________________ Just finished watching the Pistons win the second game in the best of seven series. I'm not a big basketball fan, but if we do well, it will make up for the dismal end to the season for the beloved Red Wings. Speaking of sports for a minute... the Michigan campus is a somber place today now that the NCAA has urlLink announced its sanctions. I think the additional post-season ban as well as the reduction in financial aid is going too far. The scandal was serious, but all the involved players are gone, the coaches are gone, the booster who paid out the $600,000 is dead and Michigan was imposed a series of draconian punishments upon itself. urlLink Michigan is appealing . Watched urlLink "Sandlot" again with the roommate tonight. If you've not seen it, it has to be one of the best movies about baseball there is. I think every kid should see it. Every adult who didn't see it as a kid should see it now. The urlLink Zire 71 is ordered and should be here Friday. Thanks to all of you who offered advice on replacing my stolen handheld! ____________________________________________________ I've been thinking a lot about sex lately-- not merely because of a heightened horniness. I've had some fruitful conversations with a few friends offline and urlLink online . I've not had an overwhelming amount of sex lately. I went through a dry period recently, but otherwise, I'm basically back at my normal rate of sexual encounters. But something has changed: I've lost the sense of guilt I used to carry about sex. I'm not sure what caused it to go away, but it's gone. I grew up in a deeply religious home, as I've alluded to before here. Sex was something that was unavailable to us outside of marriage. Within the confines of a marriage-- the electric fence of a marriage, as I've come to see it-- it was a beautiful thing to be enjoyed by husband and wife. But outside a marriage, it was a sin. And outside the male-female paradigm, it was an abomination. I have always had a strong personal sense of right and wrong-- even in those times when I've chosen to commit the wrong . As I grew into adolescence and began to experience the sexual feelings common to someone that age-- the desires that strangely included boys but not girls-- I knew that what I was thinking was wrong even though I had no idea there was a name for what I was feeling... nor did I have any knowledge about how to fulfill those desires. My early experiences with the International Male catalog and underwear models were furtive-- just as they were for most gay teens. But that essential sense of wrongness didn't end with coming out to myself at 26yo. I struggled with my desires for another three years before I had my first sexual contact with a guy. Someday, I might write about it in more detail, but frankly it's not worth it. I freaked out. The guilt was overwhelming. It wasn't enough that I had committed the sin of the heart by fantasizing about gay sex for years; I had sucked a real dick; I'd rimmed a real guy; I'd been naked with a boy and there was no fantasy to it. It was real and it was sin. In the dozens of encounters that have followed in the years since, I've lost the sense of the immediacy of guilt and shame. But both have followed me-- at a safe distance, so I can't see them behind me. But they're there. Some of those boys who slept with me liked me... told me so... told me that this sex was different... wanted to try for something more. And I walked away from them. Beautiful guys who I'd spent the night with-- experienced in an intimate way-- were now dirty... the prospects for something more ruined. I was a bastard to some of those guys. I left them hanging, stopped answering their emails, phone calls, messages. Even now, with other guilts diminishing... this guilt about how I treated others still haunts me. I constructed for myself the idea of sex with a boyfriend as being the right way to enjoy sex. But even then, I couldn't because it was still dirty. And so I ultimately hurt boyfriends I loved and then broke up with them when I could no longer have sex with them. I do not know exactly when it happened... partly because the guilt has been receding slowly but surely. But after about 6 months of not having sex, when I did break the celibacy a few weeks ago, something was different. The encounters were different from ones I had had before. They were more varied, more experimental, less predictable. And with each one there was a growing sense of satisfaction afterward. A week ago, I wrote here about one particular experience I had with a couple with whom I'm friends. It was great sex, intense, passionate, crossed a personal boundary for myself, and left me deeply peaceful for the first time ever. I'm not going to pretend that all the guilt is gone. Nor will I pretend like I've gained some insight that others can use to deal with the guilt they feel. How can I, when I'm not even sure what happened with me? All I can say is that I think I'm getting closer to the experience of sex as it should be. The intensity and the passion and the emotion exchanged determines how good it was-- not whether or not it was in the confines of some strictly defined relationship. In fact, as far as I'm concerned, the only confines are safety and mutual consent. A month ago, a friend of mine asked me what my sexaul fantasy was. For the first time, I didn't come back with something quick and dirty. Instead, I thought for a few minutes. And the fantasy that materialized was one of my first signs that something inside me was changing: We're in bed naked... laying on top of each other... our breathing less ragged as the orgasm fades. It's dark, but as I lift my head up from your neck, I can see your eyes in the dark, three inches from mine... and they're looking at me. I stare into your eyes as I clasp your hands in mine and lift them over your head. My lips meet yours, and my eyes close... stinging from a single bead of sweat. Our lips lock and at that moment, I am you. You were inside my body a few moments ago, but now in this moment, with each passing second as we kiss... you are inside my soul. To say anything more now would be to intellectualize a moment of fantasy and yearning that deeply moves me as few other thoughts have.
Sometimes I'm amazed at the capacity of the brain. We can walk in a reasonably coordinated manner. We can talk, sometimes simultaneously. We can type words, add numbers and develop weapons of mass destruction. And we can wake up on time without the benefit of an alarm clock. Well, some of us can. I can't... or at least I can't most of the time. Except this morning. I woke up at 4:31am... desk light on... computer laying next to me on the edge of the bed... alarms not set... phone not charging. But, I woke up on time! How I did, I don't know... except that maybe my mind goes through unexpected and short-lived periods where it decides to cooperate with me. This same thing happened last week. In both cases, it was pure luck that I got up on time. Often in the past, I've awakened at precisely the moment when I'm supposed to be at work or somewhere else. There's nothing worse than that... but I've never fully understood why if my brain can wake me up at the very moment I'm supposed to be at work, it can't be trained to wake me a full 30 minutes before that. But now that I think of it... that's exactly what happened today. Is my brain evolving? Maybe this means my knuckles will stop dragging on the ground finally, which might make dating less awkward. Thursday! And that means my paper includes urlLink Circuits ... the weekly tech supplement. The writing is great, down to earth, and forward-focused. And if things go as planned, I won't have time to read it until Sunday. Oh say, while I'm thinking of it... urlLink read this story , if you haven't already, about the ways in which bacteria communicate with each other. This is a recent discovery and it could have profound implications for how we fight bacterial infections in the future. Right now, we blast 'em with anti-biotics, which grow ineffective with time as bacteria evolves. But researchers like Bonnie Bassler at Princeton think finding a way to cut communication among the bacteria could destroy their virulence. Sort of like war strategy: you can attack every army and soldier or you can attack command and control first, cutting regiments off from each other and rendering them more ineffective. I talked to Doctor Bassler yesterday and she's a gem of a woman. When the MacArthur people called to tell her she was getting a genius grant, they asked her if she knew of any colleagues who had received one. "I'm sorry, I don't hang out with that caliber of people." I asked her if there's a ceremony. Nope, she said... they leave me alone, except for the checks. I was a little disappointed to hear that. Someday, if I get a genius grant (um... kind of a stretch, right?) I'll want a ceremony. And a crown.
Just got back from a Salsa Fundraiser... a salsa judging contest where we got the chance to taste about 20 different salsas from 10 different restaurants around the Detroit area and name our favorites. My $25 went to the Midwest AIDS Prevention Project and in return, I had plenty of chips, all the salsa variety I could handle, music, dancing and Corona. My hot salsa winner was the #4 sauce made by Tio's, which is just down the street from me in Ann Arbor. It's been a long-time favorite of mine and in my opinion it kicked the ass of the competition. The mild salsa winner was a surprise... a green tomatillo sauce with roasted jalapenos that gave it a tremendous depth of flavor. It was also surprisingly warm for a mild sauce. It's from urlLink Agave , a restaurant in Detroit. Never been... so I can't say much about it. What I can say about the experience is how many restaurants make a mediocre-- or worse-- salsa. Frankly, Pace Picante Sauce has more aroma, texture and appeal than a few of the restaurant-made salsas. That was the dissapointing part. Other than that, an enjoyable evening with my friend Doug and his mom. I need to cram a few more of the evenings in over the next few weeks before he relocates to Colorado to take a new position with his urlLink company . I have a couple days of research and writing to do for a TV client next week, so I've taken some time off from my real job to get that done. It occurred to me yesterday that even though I can't do my DC trip as planned, because my presence (as "the ex") will threaten C's new boyfriend, or something like that-- I shouldn't just sit home working on the project. So I haven't decided what I'll do for sure yet, but I'll go to either DC, Chicago or Toronto for 4 days next week. Get a hotel with high speed internet access, find a Starbucks with wireless... and work at the hotel or elsewhere for 8 hours each day on Thursday and Friday, enjoy quiet evenings out... and then have the weekend to cap it off. So much better than beaching myself in Ann Arbor. Right now, I'm leaning toward DC. Taking a trip like this is normally something I'd call frivolous but I think it would be relaxing and I make a lot of money that I haven't used much for fun lately. Chicago and Toronto are easy drives-- equidistant-- from where I live... and I already have a ticket to fly to DC. I was going to write something else, too... but I'm too tired to do it. My eyes have been about to close since 2pm today... and with my lymph nodes already painfully swollen and my roommate downstairs with a fever, I need to get my rest!
Shaving this morning, I decided for the 12th time to try for a little patch of hair on my chin. Not some big bushy thing, like a hedge or something. I'm talking about... well, I don't know what I'm talking about. And that's why all these tries have been unsuccessful. Or maybe it's only part of the reason. Maybe it's a dumb idea in the first place. Except that urlLink Justin Timberlake has a few pics with one so it must be possible to do something on one's chin that's subtle. Oh what the hell, who knows. If it makes it through the day, I'll snap a picture of it tonight. I'm so shy. Yesterday I was having dinner at the urlLink gay bar and grill ... All You Can Eat Spaghetti-- a Tuesday Classic. And this adorable guy walks in. Not too tall, nice smile, African-American, cute but he looked smart. Know what I mean? Some guys are cute for days but so dumb they can't find their ass with both hands. I think you can see when a guy is dumb. But I also think you can see something in their eyes or the way they're carrying themselves that tells you they've got it going on. So anyway, I practically target a laser beam on his forehead as he walks in; eyes lock; smile; eyes remain locked. Guy turns to talk to Matt, who's tending bar. I think to myself, I'm doing well . That gay "you're hot" stare is always hard for me to maintain and return. But I've been working on it. Guy walks by to go upstairs. Eyes lock again; I give him the "yes you're hot" smile and slight nod of the head; he goes upstairs, bending over so low as he gets higher that he was nearly doubled over trying to maintain eye contact. Now usually I would think, hmmm... I wonder if he likes me? (This is because I look reasonably smart, but I'm stupid.) This time I was on the ball. So I paid my bill... and left. I couldn't go upstairs because I didn't know what I would say or how I would start the conversation. And so another opportunity passes. geesh....
I should have put together a paragraph on Sunday pulling together all sorts of posts about urlLink Cherry . But it's Wednesday and a little late for that right now, so I'll pass on two notes -- one from urlLink Jimbo , who slept his way through Cherry-- and not the way you'd think; and urlLink Cool Relax , who wrote the kind of piece I would have written if I was there. Only I would have been more nervous. GeekSlut has written a urlLink piece about a relationship he had with a guy named Robby. It's disturbing and moving... and so honest it hurts. Guys like GeekSlut and SoBlo encourage me to push the envelope in this medium. Every day, I discover more about the power of words to express deep emotions and change lives.
No, I'm not talking about needing help because I'm a geek-- although that might be a good thing. I'm in the market for a new handheld computer... since mine was stolen last weekend in Toronto. Any suggestions from PDA owners? Recommendations? At this point, based on the combination of power, capacity and size, I'm leaning toward the Palm Tungsten T. If you're using the T, I'd love any capsule reviews you could send. I'll probably make my decision by the end of the week. Anyway, urlLink write me . Weblog Additions I've been doing some spring cleaning on the right hand column... adjusting the list of recommended weblogs to include some new guys I've been reading lately and enjoying. Check out urlLink Intertextual , urlLink Snozzwanger , urlLink DogPoet and urlLink GeekSlut . Spin has fallen off the list; Chris has stepped away from journaling because of all the other work that he has to do.
I'm going to accomplish any work tonight. I have plenty to do... a 500 page book on what went wrong at NASA at the time of the Challenger disaster. Yes, nice bedtime reading, I know, but I'm talking to the author of the report tomorrow to hear her views on NASA culture. She's had some thoughtful and provocative comments about NASA hierarchy since the loss of Columbia. I'll spend some time with it tonight before bed. But once again, I find myself in what must be a super Spring Fever mode... not wanting to do any work at all... just wanting to write here. I'm not even sure I have that much to say, but I guess I definitely want to say as little or as much of it here. Had a talk with Matt today about my ex today. I've been feeling a greater need of independence from him and a strong desire to move on with my life. I've already written here about the sexual dimensions of this but there are other dimensions, as well. I think it's become especially important to find my own way and that means defining a space that belongs to me and isn't "Dave and Todd." Particularly since he's my roommate for the time being. Sometimes, I feel bad because I leave him out of plans without mentioning them to him. Last week, we were watching TV and a report about SARS came on and Dave said, "We definitely need to go back to Toronto soon." I hesitated. "Um, actually I'm going this weekend." Since it was only 3 days away and he was my roommate I would have to tell him at some point and so I did. He wasn't devastated. He's a big boy who can handle himself. But I sensed disappointment. And I felt bad. I had thought to ask him to go with. But I wanted that weekend more than anything else to be relaxing and a time to spend with my friends Matt and Leeron, not watching my ex drink more than he should and hit on a bunch of boys. He can do that on his own time but I don't want to have to be around his drinking or dick-lust. Those of you who read regularly might say I'm not nearly as ready to move on with my life as I say I am. This might be partially true. But the fact is, when I'm away from him I'm feeling good and not thinking about him in a negative way. Plus, few guys-- no matter how healed from their old relationships-- enjoy watching their ex-boyfriends of recent vintage hitting on other boys. It extends to other non-sexual areas. He emailed this morning to say that we were invited to a party for a non-profit theater group. We've gone to these types of things together before and that's cool. But today I didn't feel like confusing more people who already can't figure out if he and I are together or not. They see us together everywhere so the end result is that after 6 months, I'm still asked regularly if we're together. And no, I don't feel like going camping with you this weekend... maybe another time soon. Fuck, I feel like a bastard. (Damn... and I love camping, too!) But I won't fake it and deny my desire to do my own thing sometimes without him around. It doesn't mean we're not friends. In fact, we're rather close. But all of us have those times where even close friends need to be at a slight distance. Maybe it's a male hormone thing-- a gentle version. Sort of the NPR version of PMS-- internally bitchy but nice and sweet on the outside. To redeem myself, I should mention that I invited him to dinner at the local gay bar last night for Cinco de Mayo and spent a few great hours hanging out. So there, you naysayers. :) Lately, I've been in one of those "Don't give me any of that shit" kinds of moods. It's quite unusual for me and I kind of like it.
i love You and i don't know what to do with it; where to put it in the little slots that are my mind where i keep things sorted out or at least try to. i love You and i don't know what to do about it. i love You when You take me, when You fill me, when You make me feel full and loved and happy and Yours. i love You when You roll me up in a little ball tight and say hang on and You stretch me wide and You go deeper than ever than anyone and say "my little watermelon with a hole cut in it" i love You when You say "on your knees doggie style, little doggie" and i bark and You smile and thrust harder deeper than earlier even and i stretch and i cry and You kiss my tears and smile into my eyes and You don't stop You just push my head into the pillow and say "that's it, little man, that's it". i love You when you buy things for Your house/car/yard/computer/self and You buy extra or save the left-overs for me because You know i won't think of it or even realize that i need it but You do. i love You when You look at me that way laughing and not and smiling with Your eyes, when You touch my head that way, my head/leg/arm/back/side/dick, when You kiss me that way like You're feeding me and filling me and we are one person/thing/animal gasping and i love you and i don't know what to do with it. i love You when i see You/feel You/hear You and i love You more when i'm with You and i love You and i don't know what to do with it. written by urlLink Chris@snozzwanger.com 2003 copied with permission
Thanks to a few of you for passing on recommendations for the Clie. It's been a longtime fave with me for the quality of the product. But I've just seen the new Zire 71 from Palm. It has a camera which I'm not that excited about but in side-by-side comparisons the Zire wins out over all the Clie's for screen resolution and particularly for brightness. Still more research to be done...
I can't adequately explain the space I'm in right now but it's different from any space I've been in before. My space ... my me ... remains... but a new and different me has slipped underneath. The me I knew so well is no longer my skin. It's a garment, a fabric, covering my new skin. My new skin is a terrain of new sensations of pain and pleasure. Each sensation is etched carefully, exactly, powerfully within me. How long has this been going on? It's come slowly... the experience of visceral feelings leading to a crescendo, a wave of intense emotion from somewhere inside me that I didn't know existed... home to years of pent up love, anger, pain, ecstasy, frustration, hope, etc. And now, in the midst of normal daily happenings I experience sharp, crystal clear visions of feeling. Moments of intense passion, occasional waves of deep sadness, bright seconds of pure joy. They are the sharp, bright colors of the brain on E... juxtaposed with everyday vision. Whenever one of these transcendent moments occurs, I reach for it. I've spent my life mastering feelings... emotions... thoughts... actions... living in tight control. Now, the rising wave asks me to let go and ride... live the feeling. And so, in those moments words cut deep... songs soothe... lyrics become oracles. Sex becomes the satiation of an animal thirst for lips, skin, breath, connection. Why am I experiencing this now? I think I'm nearing an inflection point... a time of personal, internal change... a renewing of life... and something else that I can't yet quite grasp. It's a man... but even as I speak I don't know who it is or how fast he's approaching me. But I feel him approaching and I'm waiting for him and I'm waiting for this new skin to urlLink tra nsf urlLink orm me .
There are some things that happen that instantly drag you back to a moment in childhood. Today, it was my friend Matt... who said, for a reason I no longer remember: I never quite understood the purpose of mayonnaise. There was always something a bit suspect about it. At that moment, I was taken back to 4th grade... to the bologna and mayonnaise sandwiches. We never had a lot of money when I was growing up. So school lunch was a bologna sandwich and a Tupperware container of applesauce or maybe some pudding. Sometimes, Mom cut up some slices of apple. The apple slices would go slightly brown even when she wrapped them. I was kind of a finicky kid and even the slightest bit of brown made them bad and inedible. I didn't like stuff stored in Tupperware, either, because it usually contaminated food with a pervasive Tupperware smell and taste. But the worst thing in the world was mayonnaise. I hated mayonnaise. I still do... although like many of us with food dislikes... as adults, we can deal with them in small quantities. But when I was a kid, the taste of Miracle Whip was enough to make me gag. Not that the Helman's would have made the problem much better. Mom knew I didn't like mayo. But for some reason, I almost always got mayo on my bologna sandwiches. I was miserable. I begged Mom to make my sandwiches with butter. And sometimes she did. But most of the time she forget and made them with mayo. I tried eating them. But my Mom spread the Miracle Whip on thickly and it was virtually impossible for me to choke the sandwiches down. I tried scraping off as much as I could and then putting the sandwich back together. But kids have stealth taste buds that can detect the presence of any foreign, unwanted substance. I could still taste the mayo. So at some point, I stopped eating them. I buried the sandwiches in our yard. We had evergreen type bushes that grew near the house and it was in the dirt under those bushes that I buried the offending mayonnaise and bologna sandwiches. Buried might be too good a word to describe what I did. Mainly I made a slight depression in the hard dirt... stuck the sandwich in and then piled dirt over the top. Perhaps the weakness of this strategy is becoming clear to you by now. But let me explore a few more salient points. 1) I didn't get rid of the sandwiches in the garbage at school... I brought them back to Mom Central to bury them. I'm not sure why-- I think I was afraid that the lunch lady would catch me throwing away food and I would get in trouble for it. One of our lunch ladies used to make a point of bringing up the subject of starving children when we threw food away. Which I never understood, because if I ate all the food on my plate, the starving children wouldn't get it anyway. And even to this day, I think the last thing a starving child needs is bologna and Miracle Whip. 2) My burial methods were ineffective. I soon discovered that even after I buried each sandwich, I would have to return to the scene of the crime to cover the evidence again. I hoped that time might pass quickly and that the sandwiches might decay. Obviously, I had a deeper faith in the power of nature over preservative-embedded bologna than was warranted. I wondered if ants with large appetites for bologna lived nearby. In cartoons, they seem to work together like an army, marching in and carrying off whole sandwiches from the picnic. EO Wilson has shown us they do work together. But he's never specifically proven that they carry off large sandwiches. 3) Again, for a moment... let's consider other possible options. I could have tossed the sandwich in a garbage can on the way home from school. It was only three blocks back to my house, but there was an alley. There were garbage cans. There was a giant freakin' ravine. But no... I took the sandwich back home to dispose of it there. Behind a bush in the front yard. 4) Over the days and weeks, I began to realize that I was going to have a problem. Like spent nuclear fuel, eventually we run out of places to store it. I didn't really need a mountain in the desert. But it was clear that the ground under the two evergreen bushes in the front yard wouldn't support that many more sandwiches. I had started to stack them slightly. I buried a couple in the backyard by the big willow tree. But this was problematic because we played outside a lot and a game of baseball or football might lead to a disturbing discovery. 5) Again, for a moment... let's consider another option. I could have thrown the sandwiches away in our own garbage. But I was certain-- for some reason that makes no sense anymore-- that my parents carefully monitored the garbage from moment to moment. I seemed to think that Mom would somehow be able to detect a sandwich buried in the kitchen trash. The same went with the garbage outside. I clearly remember putting a sandwich in the outside garbage thinking that would take care of it. But when the garbage collectors came something happened and the sandwich had fallen to the bottom of the can. The garbage bags had flattened the sandwich... and there it remained... glued to the bottom of the can-- the very mayonnaise that I so hated was bearing witness to my deed. The end came quickly after that. One afternoon, my little brother saw me burying something behind the evergreen bush. I wouldn't tell him what it was. It was about 10 minutes later that Mom called me downstairs to confront me with the evidence. I wisely bypassed outright denial. But there's not much you can offer in terms of an explanation except the truth. I've racked my brain and even now, I can't come up with a good excuse for piling up sandwiches underneath an evergreen bush in the front yard and covering them with dirt. Except that I don't like mayonnaise. Never have.
We're on the way to Toronto even as we speak. It's going to be a pleasant weekend of hanging out with friends and generally taking it easy. Ontario is not the most exciting province to drive through. Now, realize I'm saying this... an Iowan who is more than ready to argue that his state has tons of natural beauty. People malign it for its sameness. But since I’ve seen just about every nook and cranny of the state, I can attest to its diverse terrain. Yeah there are no mountains or oceans but we have nice rolling hills and pleasant lakes. Ontario on the other hand, is featureless. This is totally unfair since the only part of Ontario I've ever seen (so far) is the stretch of interstate that lies between the border with Michigan and Toronto. Last time we went to Toronto, it was dark... and as far as I'm concerned it could be dark now. The Iowan in me is certain that Ontario has plenty of beauty that I haven't seen yet. But like the visitor in Iowa, my view of the province is being shaped by the view from the highway. And it ain't pretty. I don't think about Iowa very much anymore. But I did today when my friend Matt asked me what life would have been like for me if I had stayed on the farm. Well, I didn't grow up on the farm. But I'm the first generation removed from the farm on my dad's and the first in the family to go to university. So think about it. Frankly, it's kind of scary. Have you ever thought about what you would have been doing if you had been born 100 years ago? Many of us are in careers that never existed then. What would our interests have been if we had been farmers? If I hadn't farmed what else would I have done? I'm the oldest in my family. Would I have been expected to carry on the farming tradition from my dad and his dad before him? I never had to make that choice because my dad chose to leave the farm. He went to automation school as they called it in those days. He learned how to program computers. He never had a college education beyond that training he got in trade school. But I think you can argue that he directly made the kind of life I live today possible. Not that I couldn't do what I've done without him. But when he moved off the farm, the expectations for us changed entirely. We kids were expected to excel in school and we were expected to go to college. It was never presented to us as a way to improve the lot of the family as a whole because we weren't that close of a family. But that's essentially what it was. We reached Toronto... and since we were running behind, we drove directly (well, quite indirectly) to pick up Soblo. We had tickets for the 10:15pm showing of X2. Great movie, fun crowd of die-hard fans... on to a late dinner.. and then back to the car, which had been broken into. Someone had broken the front right door glass to gain entry to the car. If they’d had a lot of time to rummage around, they would have gone away with a lot of merchandise. Breaking a window in a parking garage doesn't really allow one the luxury of poking around in someone else's car. Still, my friend Matt lost a bag with a laptop and cellphone... and my long-suffering, hard-working Palm Vx is gone forever. Oh, and my birth certificate and Matt's passport. So, Saturday morning, we had to spend about 2 hours working on the police report, getting the glass replaced, talking to insurance... and my friends spent some time closing accounts and changing passwords. The loss for them was pretty bad. Their data is backed up but there's a lot of sensitive business data on the computer. Chances are, the guy or guys who stole it aren't white collar criminals who care about getting to passwords and credit card numbers. They want hardware. But you can't take many chances with identity theft. My lapper was also along for the trip, despite the pledge not to go online for the weekend. But the thieves missed it. Toronto is about the last place I would expect something like this to happen. Heck, I think of all the times I go to Detroit and don't think for a second that something might happen to the car. And Detroit doesn't have Toronto's reputation for safety, to put it lightly. Same for any other city. The bottom line is that anything can happen anywhere. Sometimes fate picks you. The guys wouldn't have been able to see a sign of anything in the car because the windows are tinted. But they could see the Michigan plates, so they broke the window and then grabbed a few things once they found what we'd hidden away in the back. It’s likely that even if we'd emptied the car at the hotel before the movie, they still would have broken the window just to check out what’s inside. But, really, enough about this. It was a loss but it didn't put a stop to the weekend. we had the window fixed by noon and all the other business take care of, so we could get back to the business of leisure. Let me say urlLink Soblo was a great host. We had the best time on a trip that I've had in a long time. The highlight of the weekend was Saturday night at Buddies. They're celebrating their 25th anniversary, so there was a music and comedy revue in the evening. It featured local talent and it was the best revue of its kind I've ever seen. We danced afterward. And it was probably the best night of dancing I've had in a long time. As my friend Matt said, it was music with words—a highly eclectic mix of dance and disco from probably the last 25 years. It's hard to make a mix like that work in seamless perfection. But it didn't matter. The songs were so fun that I didn't care. By 3, I was tapped out and called it a night. Sunday was an appropriately late start, breakfast and the drive home. About SARS: to paraphrase Soblo from about a week ago, if you've cancelled or postponed a trip to Toronto because of fears that you'd catch SARS, you're an idiot. There's such a thing as being careful; but it's another thing entirely to treat SARS as a deadly pandemic. Toronto is still vibrant… despite being nearly emptied of tourists. We were even treated as heroes by a few people who found out we were from the US. Not that they're very happy with our government – but that's another problem for another time.
It was a good summit... less rancorous than expected. Although no one quite knew why President Chirac insisted on bringing his urlLink life-size cardboard cutout of President Bush .
I've experienced one of those firsts that guys who are much younger than me usually experience: I bottomed for only the second guy in my life this week. More significant for me... it was the first time I did it with someone other than my ex-boyfriend. Mine is an odd set of circumstances... not out till 26 yo... no sex with a guy until 29. I avoided the issue of anal sex for several years... which is not to say I ignored butts. Oh no indeed. But no anal sex. My first experiences with anal sex were as a top. Sex partners wanted it and I tried to comply. For a few personal reasons, I had trouble topping. When I began dating Dave, who was an exclusive top, it was my chance to get serious about exploring the other side of the fence. I hesitated for a while until Dave pushed the issue. So last fall at 35 yo, I bottomed for the first time. Doing it with Dave was the coolest. As my boyfriend and one of my closest friends, he lovingly guided me through a rather slow and painful process. After that first time, I knew what guys meant about having the itch and I wanted him inside me again and again. Dave and I broke up a few months later and in my heartbroken state, I thought it would be a long time before I was that vulnerable with someone again. He was my first and only... and I had that sense that the only guy I wanted to feel in that way was him. And it was-- for nearly 6 months. Wednesday night, though, I decided it was long enough. The boy's hot, moist breath was in my ear, his voice husky... "you want it, don't you?" The other boy was behind me. I could feel his dick straining to go where his tongue had already been. And in that moment, something clicked inside my head. A door that I had propped open for 6 months closed with a bang. I watched it shut... cutting my ex-boyfriend off from view. And I was alone. And ready. What followed didn't last all that long. It didn't have to. The culmination of 2 hours of sex, the event ended explosively and safely. I hugged my friends goodbye and drove home. And I walked up the stairs to my loft, in that dreamlike state that one of my friends says always follows a good fuck. And as I took off my clothes and got into my own bed, I felt calm... free... and ready to move on.
Ah sleep... I had 6 hours of it last night... entirely by accident. The mistake-- and I make this one often-- is the decision to do my studying in bed. I got under the covers... set the laptop next to me... and picked up the 800 lb gorilla of a book about urlLink Ford , which I recommend highly, btw. Approximately 5 minutes later, I was asleep. I woke up at 4:48am, lights on, no alarms set. Once again I'm amazed and happy that I tend to sleep without moving... given how many times I fall asleep with the laptop on the bed. I woke just in time to get up and get to work on time... which causes another moment of amazement and happiness-- since I'm generally so sleep deprived that I depend on an alarm to wake me up. The Toronto trip is coming together... which means that it's taking shape as a relaxing lightly-scheduled weekend. I'm excited to be meeting urlLink Soblo , who is the first Blogger I've met in person. I've read his journal as long as any other, and I've gained what I think is a good sense of who he is and what's important to him. It will be interesting to see how the "written" Soblo compares with the "live" Soblo; I'm a huge admirer of the written version and I'm certain I'll feel the same about the live version. But in the sense that we create ourselves online in this journaling environment, we emphasize certain things about ourselves and deemphasize others. He reads me sometimes... I read him. So I suppose we'll both be doing comparisons. Soblo is smart as a whip, widely read, and he writes from the heart, which tells me he's reasonably well connected to himself. It will be a cool, relaxing weekend with my friends and a chance to make a new one. Now, to make plans to meet Jockohomo, Chrisonomicon, Puck and a few other of you cool people. Sex is relaxing. It's been slow for me, but I've come to realize how well good sex can calm the mind. It changes one outlook. I used to see sex as a necessary evil... the pursuit of one's desires through a dirty, guilt-ridden process. But I think it was more clear to me last night than ever how that expression of emotional intimacy, in the right environment, can have such a positive effect. I don't have anything more to say about this really... an observation and a lesson for myself on how far I've come since coming out. Oh and I'm not recommending the new Douglas Brinkley book about Ford because it helps me sleep. It's a brilliant history of Ford Motor Company and Henry Ford, in particular. I can guarantee that you'll be able to stay awake through all of it. Brinkley is a master historian.
First of all... if you're the guy with the beautiful eyes, the long stare and the Michigan hat at the Toronto Pride parade today... email me NOW! Why the heck do I see hot guys like that... smile and then get nervous and walk away? Because I'm a dork, that's why. At least I'm smiling now and not running away in fear. I turned around and went back after a few minutes but he was gone. No chance of finding him among so many people. I have to stop walking away from opportunities. The main story though... I had a great time at Toronto Pride. I was extremely low key by Pride standards. I took my friends Matt and Leeron over to Kensington Market, where I bought some cool shirts. I spent a couple hours reading at the coffee place I like. I skipped the circuit parties and the bars. Instead, I focused on friends and relaxing and couldn't have been happier. Another great experience from Pride: 5 hours of cool conversation with a new friend on Saturday. We had met up with a few home state pals Saturday evening with plans to go to dinner. We were walking down Church St and I said to Matt, "Is that K., the porn star?" It was and although he lives in my city, I'd never met him beyond exchanging some emails before. So he joined us for dinner, too. After dinner, the others peeled off to check out the sights and K. and I went off to talk. We started in around 9pm and when they closed Starbucks and kicked us out around midnight, we moved to a diner and talked till about 2:30am. It was a cool, wide-ranging discussion... from porn shoots to relationships to goals to cumming on cue to life changes. I had a great time with him, and I think there will be more interaction between us in the near future. Back home tonight... and the house is almost empty of my ex's stuff. All that remains is the bed. Man, it was a fuckin' relief to come home and discover this place is now truly mine! Or very close. I won't go on much about this... since I've done that already in this space, but this is a milestone and it's a long time coming. And June is nearly behind me... the busiest month of the year has ended and now July promises to be quieter. Or so I think. I think July is going to be a pivotal month on the relationship front for me. We shall see.
I can remember the first time, in 1996, when I was at the airport and was able to use my new digital cellphone. It was quite liberating and productive. I'm reminded of it sitting here now, connected by wireless to high speed Internet. It's quite liberating. Productive? Not on your life. :)
I stood around after the presentation... talking to people... hearing their enthusiasm for my presentation... the concepts I discussed, the clips I chose. Now, I'm staring at the check and thinking, yeah you can do this . I don't mean to be repeating Soblo... but I guess a lot of us question our abilities. We wonder if we're really capable of what other people think we're capable of. I tend to doubt it and then when I hear otherwise, I assume that people are deluded or just don't have high standards. A year ago, I turned down this speaking appearance because I didn't think I could do it. This year, some work and an extra measure of confidence, and look what happens. Spent the evening with my friend Mark and his family. Mark and I go back to 1988. He's one of my oldest friends. We've done a lot of growing up together over the years... he made those calls to tell me he had eloped... or there was the call from Alaska telling me about their first baby. He was the first person I told that I was gay. He's my buddy... a true pal. I hadn't seen him in person for more than a year. And tonight, here I was in Phoenix and we had the chance to hang out. I look at the two of us ... and the thing is, we don't change. When we're around each other, we're still so much like the Mark and Todd who were inseparable in 1988. Maybe we have changed... but we've changed together I guess. In any case, it was great to see him. Well off to Toronto today... for a great weekend with friends... a chance to hang out, people-watch and SLEEP. Speaking of which, I can't keep my eyes open a moment longer.
um... i just walked in the bathroom in my hotel room... and it's larger than my loft apartment.
Yes it's 175 degrees but it only seems like 110. How nice. I'm here... getting ready for my big presentation. I hope everything goes well... and in about 6 hours, I'll be finished and know for certain if it did or not. i'll write more later today but there's obviously big news on the sodomy front (not every day you say that, right?) with the landmark Supreme Court decision. And more to talk about... later!
The following is the script for every trip I make to Pancheros for one of those low-fat, high-protein, fresh-mex burritos... a trip that occurs 3-4 times a week. The script is unchanging, regardless of the employee standing in front of me: Todd: "I'll have a chicken burrito for here." Employee: "Is that for here?" Todd: "Yes." Employee squashes dough for burrito... makes fresh tortilla... drops it on the plate. Employee: "Rice?" Todd: "Yes, and black beans." Employee: "Beans?" Todd: "Black." Employee: "Chicken?" Todd: "Yes... chicken." Employee: "Cheese?" Todd: "No, but I'll have lettuce, hot sauce and jalapenos." Employee: "What sauce?" Todd: "The hot sauce." Employee: "What else?" Todd: "Jalapenos" Employee: "What?" Todd: "Hah-luh-PEH-nyohs." Employee: "Oh." I know my friend Matt can vouch for me... this is literally what happens every time. It cost about $7, including the jalapenos and a regular drink. The entertainment is free. I'm sitting outdoors at brunch yesterday, having gone much later than usual because I was busy on a project. I look up from the paper and see a guy I haven't seen in probably three years. Eric... the coffee house manager who was so instrumental in easing me into the new world of being out and comfortable... the dancer with the beautiful, lithe, muscular body who has lived in New York the past few years and traveled all over the world performing... the 25 yo whose wisdom is greater than a lot of guys 20 years his senior, the guy with a shriek that tops 70 decibels. He hadn't seen me so I said "Eric." And I got a shriek from him that set a record. Gawd, it was so great to spend a few minutes catching up... with the promise of more next week when I'm back from AZ and ON. Eric and I have a lot of fun memories... but more than anything we have this connection: time after time, we have found ourselves at similar points in our lives... making similar choices and turning down similar paths. There's a certain kind of soulmate quality to that... it's so comforting to me to see him back in town-- for the summer, he says, to rest and see old friends. This is going to be the coolest and most unexpected, unlooked for, summer yet. I think I'm also going to have a good summer out on my deck. Gosh, this journal is turning into "things I will do now that my ex is gone." It's getting to be fucking ridiculous. Well, what the hell... this is going to be a good summer out on my deck, which I've barely made use of over the last two years except when I and the ex were under the influence of something. That's not to say that I won't ever be under the influence of something again... it's just to say that my eyes have been clouded for too long and now when I go out there and look down at the city below, I get excited and want to grab a good book and enjoy that space. I also want to dribble water on people's heads as they pass by below. What other mundane moments from the weekend? Oh yes... I ordered some magazines. REALLY??? Can this be true???? Yup... yeppers... ordered 'em... yup... that's me... all about the magazines. I only mention this piece of pathetic non-news because it's highly significant for me. For months, I've been carrying in my Palm a list of magazines I would order after I made changes to my work schedule and had time to get on with life. Well, that time is now exactly one month away... so on Saturday, I ordered The New Yorker, The New Republic, Washington Post Weekly, Foreign Affairs and Harper's. I ordered Out last month... also making a return engagement-- The Advocate, the DC Blade and who knows what else. I think my subscription to urlLink Refrigerated Transporter will expire without renewal.
Over the past several weeks now, I've been thinking about my last relationship in ways that I never have before. I've asked myself these questions... what if the missteps and miscues of the past two years never should have happened? What if, instead of a series of mistakes along the road to a relationship that might have been-- but failed, the whole idea was a big mistake? I use this journal as a place to record what I think now; what I think tomorrow might be different, but the journal is the ultimate snapshot of my current mindset on a topic. So this isn't a piece to wonder about how I feel about the past 2 years, but a declaration that what happened over the previous 27 months was a turn down a wrong street... a wrong decision that led to other wrong decisions... wrong decision upon wrong decision... despite advice from trusted friends and personal misgivings... and ultimately to my desire to erase all vestiges of what's happened. Now, let me play my mom for a minute and explore the "all things work together for good" defense. Yes it was a mistake, this person might say, but you learned a great deal about relationships from it; you learned about what your non-negotiables are for a relationship-- the vital ingredients that you don't think a relationship can be without; while you had relatively clear ideas of what you're looking for from love, this relationship focused you on those concerns and goals in a way that no other relationship has; your ex was and is a particularly challenging individual, so while he committed his share of mistakes, you also learned a great deal from him and came to a new appreciation of the important things in life... what makes life special beyond having money or the nicest house, or the best car or the hottest clothes or body. He reminded you of how fun wasting time can be. He made you appreciate aspects of life you had lost touch with over the years in your rush to build a career and a sense of personal achievement. You can boil this argument down to: if something that was bad ultimately produces some good, it couldn't have been all bad. This argument carries tremendous weight with me. The thought process that produced it is the one that I've been trained to use all my life by parents who took us to church 3 times a week, who made prayer a central part of their life, who believed in an omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent God, who looked for and often found purpose in all the good and bad that came with the life they led on earth. I'm not going to repudiate any of this. I might not believe every word of it anymore but I believe the general principle and that's what's important. But as I've thought about this, I find that I keep tripping over the statement: if something that was bad ultimately produces some good, it couldn't have been all bad. What I started asking myself a month ago was... if something that was bad happens to produce a little good... does that make it any less bad? No... certainly not if the bad greatly outweighs the good. Certainly not if the good lessons I learned, I could have learned in any number of other ways that involved less of the bad stuff. No... bad that produces good is still bad. It has pretty wrapping paper and a big red bow... but inside there's still nothing but a steaming pile of shit. The damage of the last two years includes a couple ruined friendships, a heavy financial toll, a mountain of emotional damage. So there we are... not a terribly complicated line of reasoning. A ruthless line of reasoning, I'll grant. But it's a necessary reassessment... and the reassessment has led to a significant and unexpected shift in my relationship with my ex. It has led me to end the relationship-- in every way imaginable. It's over. Done. If I could turn back the clock to March 2001, I would be tempted to go back and shift a few pieces of the puzzle to prevent a meeting between the two of us from taking place. The only thing that prevents me from truly wishing I could do that is that dang Prime Directive... don't fuck with the time line. Oh, and I don't have the power to turn back time. So I guess that's two reasons. I stand corrected. I have learned one thing: to get what you want-- from life or from a relationship or a career-- you have to ask for it and make a move. And to get on with my life, my career, my friends, the new relationship possibilities that exist now in my life, I have to clear out the debris of the last two years. I have to clear it out of my house and out of my life. I have to push it out the door, shut the door, padlock it. I need to clear out the other people in my life who will pass judgment on my decision, who will gossip about it, or who will try to curry favorites or play the ex against me. It's time to get the shit out. All of it. And that's what I'm doing. Clearing out all that shit reveals a new landscape. Huh, except it's not new. It's the same cool life, cool friends, cool city, cool loft, and great expectations that I had as I looked out at the world 28 months ago before I knew that other guy existed. I'm breathing fresh air again... and I feel better than ever. From this point forward, that's priority one.
Sat down tonight for dinner with Matt and M, another mutual friend of ours. The conversation turned to gay marriage and the ruling in Ontario... as well as the signal from Ottawa that gay marriage will soon be legal in all of Canada. M has been in a relationship for 7 years... plenty of time to get some sense of perspective on things. So I asked him if he and his partner have marriage on the to-do list. Probably not, was his response. M and his partner are independent guys. Both have successful, notable, established careers. In seven years, they've solidified as a couple; they have a home, they have a joint checking account, etc. I'm always looking for models that match where I am. And these models of couples who maintain a solid core with divergent interests is highly appealing. I'm an independent guy. I'm a loner. I enjoy the company of myself, a good book, or my computer to write, or a cup of coffee outdoors at a coffee shop on a warm sunny day. The time alone is the time in which I regain my sense of direction and focus. I enjoy it so much that any decision to date has always been accompanied by a careful thought process about the independence I would be giving up. When I write about wanting a boyfriend, I get mail from guys telling me I'm trying too hard to find someone... and I think, you people have no idea how wrong you are. If I was in a long-term relationship, I wonder if I would hesitate to get married or have a commitment ceremony. I think you can do either of those two things and still remain an independent person, of course. And there is a public aspect of either ceremony that's appealing to me. I like the accountability of the ceremony; the call to the community to support the union. But marriage carries with it the weight of a civil contract-- at least where it's legally recognized. Do I want that? I don't know. I can say this... I want power of attorney; I would want my partner legally recognized as my heir; if we adopted, I'd want both the parents' names on the certificate. For me, it's largely an academic issue at this point... but it's a good exercise. In getting more in touch with the kind of guy I am, I'm discovering some keys to what I want from a relationship, when one comes my way.
Besides having a nice time out last night with my friend Matt, I accomplished very little in the way of original thought yesterday. I got home around 8pm last night and I think I was in bed asleep by 9. I woke up at some point I can't remember and moved the lapper off the bed and shut off the music. My lack of memory is a sign of how tired I was. Hanging out with Matt was fun. We plotted strategy for Toronto Pride. It seems to boil down to lots of planning ahead and the use of semafore. Matt doesn't want to use his mobile phone in Toronto unless absolutely necessary-- understandable, given the roaming charges. I have 50 minutes of off-network useage available every month... but Chris and I waste that much time just saying hello and goodbye. So I'll be conserving, too. So we're at Delta Chelsea and he and Justin are at Days Inn. Shouting won't work but we might get some cans and string. I know there are at least a few webloggers and readers who will be in Toronto for Pride. Wanna go get a beer somewhere? I'm thinking of something low-key involving a little alcohol, a little food and lots of talk. Maybe Saturday afternoon for a couple hours... or some other time not in conflict with major events. More to come on this... write me if you have suggestions or you're going to be in the city and want to join us. The workouts are markedly improved following my visit to the Physical Therapist. I have more strength and more stamina. So today, I expect a good workout... a relatively short day at work, a haircut (always a good thing), more work on my presentation for next week in AZ and maybe a few friends along the way.
I take care of the ex situation and come out scarred and shaky but better than ever... and thanks boys for the advice... and particularly to urlLink you and urlLink you and urlLink you for listening at various moments. And to urlLink you because you keep me busy and make me smile. Second, I go to the physical therapist today, who digs into my back, shoulder and neck and after much "good" pain and discomfort... I feel GOOD. Chronic pain in traps gone. I'll make a few more trips so he can monitor it. But aside from some stretching exercises to keep things limber... I can keep doing the workout. Which is good because it keeps me looking decent... and that leads me to my next winning ticket... My Launchcast radio station just played some fucking "Greensleeves" type thing on 15th century instruments... following by Depeche Mode "Policy of Truth." hmmm... I have part of the preferences set correctly. But NOT ALL. Am I the only one who's a little unimpressed by urlLink the Bishop of Phoenix's story ? A guy is killed in a hit and run... one of the cars is traced to the Bishop. The fender is dented and the windshield is shattered and caved in. And the Bishop, when questioned, says, yes I was driving last Saturday night and i might have hit something-- maybe a dog or a cat or a rock . hmmm... yes, well, a destroyed windshield might be the result of a huge dog or a particularly fat-- and flying-- cat. Or maybe it was a 43 yo, 200 lb man. One can understand how easy it is to be confused-- especially when it's as late as, well, 8:30pm. The Times notes that he avoided possible criminal charges involving his supervision of sexually abusive priests just two weeks ago. And apparently went on a priestly joyride to celebrate? I'm urlLink moving to Canada . I can visit DC and NYC whenever I want to.
Dealing with the pure frustration of not having the time to write that I'd like to this week. I keep telling myself, well this is the way it's going to be until the end of the month. And that's true, but it doesn't help the frustration. Last night, faced with a solid hour that I could reserve for writing, I promptly fell asleep... the 2 hours of sleep the night before leaving my body and brain ready for one thing only-- rest. Like urlLink Intertextual , once again I woke this morning at 4:35am marveling that I'm able to sleep almost without moving-- particularly when I'm tired-- not disturbing the laptop, which is perched precariously on the edge of the bed. Had a wonderful evening with my friend Dan. He had lots of work that kept him busy throughout the evening, but he stopped by and we walked down the street to a Italian restaurant and sat outside enjoying salmon and tuna and watching boys-- and others-- walk by. I'm rediscovering my city again. The realization hit me yesterday in the early evening before Dan arrived. It had been a beautiful day-- sunny, blue sky, 80 degrees-- and about 6pm, I went out on the roof, sat down, and picked up the newspaper. I saw all the normal downtown scenes below me-- cars passing, pedestrians walking. Across the street, most of the seats in the coffee shop were empty. And I remembered that it's June, the students are gone, the "halcyon days" have arrived once again... and I'm just waking up from almost two years of a coma. How new everything seems. Is that strange? But hasn't that happened to you before? Something that you see every day fades into sameness. And then something changes and suddenly, everything that's the same is revealed with a kind of new-ness. I suppose it's odd. But as I shake off the misery of the last two years, everything seems new. It's summer. I'm happy. I have friends everywhere. Now, if I could be a little more lazy and read more of the paper. That time is coming...
Here's a urlLink new book that is sure to be a hit with "the Ladies."
At last, two sunny days in a row with the temperature at 80 degrees! Who would've thought that might happen? It's been a good weekend. I had a driving trip to an event on Saturday night and that was a great time. Thank urlLink you for keeping me company by phone on the long drive across the state! I missed being in Toronto this weekend... but I'm hoping to drop in for a day next weekend and get some reading done and maybe finalize the work on a project I have due at the end of the month. If I don't make it to TO next weekend... there's always Pride at the end of the month. And the best part is that I'll finish my presentation in AZ... fly back into Detroit at 4pm on Friday 6/27 and jump in the car heading for TO. I miss the city and my favorite hangouts. OK, here's the deal... an elaboration on something I hinted at a week ago: the ex is moving out at the end of this month. We're breaking off ties and moving on with life... something we should have done a long time ago. One might argue it's something we should have done within hours of meeting. But I think you learn from every relationship you've been in. And while it would be nice for us to continue with a friendship beyond the end of the relationship, we've tried that and I don't think we've gone far enough in re-establishing separate lives. So I decided unilaterally that it was time to make a bigger break. I was harsh about it. Probably far harsher than I should have been. But the ties between us were many (financial, mutual friends, projects) and severing them would have proven quite difficult without a moment of truth, so to speak. I created a moment of truth, striking at a particular issue that's festered in our relationship and friendship almost from the very beginning. And it brought the whole house down in a matter of hours. Talk about a surgical strike. I couldn't imagine a cleaner break. And I have to tell you, I feel good. Yes, people in town will talk about us. But people have talked about us ever since the beginning... many of them up to no good. So that's no loss. Yeah, his close friends are probably not going to talk to me for a while. Well, life goes on. Yes our mutual friends will be bewildered, particularly because I'm not going to talk about it. But I think most of our friends, even if they disagree with the way things went, will understand a basic concept-- one I've written about here a few times: sometimes you can be friends with your ex and sometimes you can't. If they can't understand it, fuck 'em. I think what's there at the start between two people will help determine what will remain after the relationship ends. You can't build a life together-- or even a friendship together without something tangible and real. And when there is something tangible... you can kill it with a whole lot of shit. So... move on. When I talked to you yesterday, you were busy downloading music. You know, there are those songs we remember and like. Songs that are good, or cool, or bring back memories... but they're not worth going out and buying the entire album to own them. These are perfect downloading tracks. You reminded me of a bunch of music that I didn't have so today I've been downloading old 80's hits and late 90's dance tracks. Stuff that I think should be in my collection but isn't. I've loaded up on some Daft Punk, Oakenfold, Kim English, Madonna and Pet Shop Boys, among others. This week is going to be half decent! Makes me happpy after a very busy week last week. I'm past the hump on the busiest month of the year and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
Ah... Bjork. Listening to urlLink Homogenic takes my back to 1997/98... Sunday afternoons at my computer working on my study materials and listening to music. Not the most pleasant memory, doing work on a Sunday, but I certainly love this album. I met one of the fathers of Techno music today... urlLink Kevin Saunderson . Some of you already know it, but Techno is homegrown in Detroit, so it's ironic that these African-American guys in Detroit created a music that is known worldwide but has its biggest following among white people in Europe. Blacks chose hip-hop and rap. What I enjoyed most about the conversation was the image of Kevin and his friends Juan Atkins and Derrick May getting together after high school and playing with synthesizers and drum machines and slowly fashioning what has become of the major musical trends of the modern era. These guys were just playing around. How many stories of great innovation begin with a few people playing around?
A big Kiss, hug, and thanks to urlLink seant for moving heaven and earth to get me the Canadian poll stats on gay marriage. I saw them in Saturday's Globe and Mail but didn't keep the issue, assuming it would be online. The text articles for the New Canada series are there... but the two pages of graphical poll data aren't. Neither is the info on Lexis Nexis. So, I emailed seant thinking that he might have an old copy lying around. I think he reads the Globe; I know he's not a regular reader of the National Post. Right, my friend? :) He didn't have the issue... so I assumed that would be the end of it. He did his duty... I would do the ethical thing and make up the poll data as best as I could remember it. (So sue me.) Well, seant goes beyond the extra mile... he checks with family members and ultimately goes to the library... gets the paper and digs up the stats for me. urlLink YOU would be a gem of a guy even if you hadn't done this... and you are... but this was super-cool. And here are those stats... to correct what I wrote here yesterday: Do you support gay marriage? _____________ Male______Female age 18-34_____61.2%_____69.2% age 35-54_____55.0%_____62.2% age 55+ ______24.6%_____37.6% from The Globe and Mail, 6/7/03 Oh... and my email box filled up today. I was busy most of the day and didn't notice it until this evening. So if you sent something and it bounced back... I'm sorry. Send again.
urlLink Pollster Michael Adams finds a surprising divergence in thought on political and social issues between Canadians and Americans. Remember... most Canadians live within 100 miles of the US border. They watch TV from Detroit and Buffalo. Shows like "Will and Grace" and "Saturday Night Live" run on Global. Even the CBC has "The Simpsons." They get the New York Times same day delivery. America looms as a giant. When SARS broke out in Toronto, thousands of Americans stayed away and it's likely to be years before tourism recovers in Ontario. The Globe and Mail is running a urlLink series currently on urlLink the 3.9 million 20-somethings who live in Canada. To quote the GLobe and Mail: They are the most deeply tolerant generation of adults produced in a nation known for tolerance. Polls find an overwhelming number of Canadians in their twenties support gay marriage. They're equally supportive of gay adoption. Even Canada as a whole is more tolerant. The country is split on gay marriage when you poll all adults... 49% support and 46% oppose, with 5% unsure. Compare that to America, where some polls show at best 35% of citizens are for gay marriage. (I'm not going to get into the argument about the pros and cons of gay marriage here. I use it as an example of tolerance because it happens to be a geat example. It challenges one of people's most dearly held beliefs-- marriage as a sacrament between man and woman. It polarizes and draws a sharp line through society.) So what is it about Canada? Canadian readers? Americans? Who has an idea? I have two thoughts. First, I think Canadians have generally been raised in a more tolerant society. OK, that's an easy one. But since we share common roots, how is it that they got the tolerance and we got the belligerence? Second, I do think that one of the great achievements of Canadian history is the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The twenty-somethings' parents had a vision for a multicultural Canada and they brought it about. I love this quote from the Globe and Mail article. "The Charter was not created to reflect Canada; but the Charter did create a new Canadian generation that reflects the Charter." But what I want to know is how the Charter's ethic is presented to Canadian children; what it represents to them; how equality is modeled at home for children. And since at least a portion of it looks much like the American Bill of Rights... again, what gives? I want to know why we are so screwed up... comparatively speaking... and Canada is so relatively tolerant.
Do you think that, months or years later, I'll look back on all of this and know what it was all about? I like to think that I will because I've always liked the idea of summing things up. Part of the fun of experiencing anything is being able to wrap it up in a nice little package. Explanation clear and simple. That's what it was. That was what the deal was with that . This is what was learned. This is what happens next. I made a decision about a month ago that some things couldn't be wrapped up that easily. So there are some things that I'm stuffing into a box and throwing away. It's a big mess and a bunch of stuff is sticking out the sides. I could save the box of stuff to go through it later. But I can't. It's too painful. And I'm not certain that it's worth digging through the debris trying to make some sense of it-- even though I tried doing it-- off and on-- for several months here. Generally, you only do that if you want to learn something from the experience and I think my big mistake was not realizing I've already learned some of the most important lessons of the last two years. If you learn and don't make any changes, that's the real tragedy. I'm wandering into a darkness... a darkness from which I don't want to emerge. I don't believe one should try to control one's end. But I'll sure give everyone plenty to talk about.
I had a nightmare this morning. I think I had it a few times. The problem is I'm not good at remembering dreams so I normally can't tell if I've dreamt something before. But this time I did remember. The last time I woke up was at 4:45am. I could see the clock and I could see my hotel room. The drapes were open and most of the lights in the apartment high-rise next door had gone out. I remember being slightly disoriented at first. And then on a high floor of the nearby high-rise, I saw a shadow across a window where there was a light. For some reason, it profoundly scared me. I didn't know why but I was frightened that there was someone coming from that room into mine. I was pretty much awake at this point. Trying to figure out why I was scared, I thought "this was the way it was the last time." Yes it was but when had those other times been? I thought about it for probably close to a minute before it occurred to me that what I was thinking I had experienced a few times was actually something I had dreamed. It took me about 10 minutes to process that so that I could get back to some kind of peaceful sleep again.
Well as it turns out, I am urlLink here rather than home for the weekend. It's kind of nice-- what with the proximity, the Internet for booking and a new truck and a collection of mix CD's from urlLink you and urlLink you -- to be able to make a decision at 1:30pm... be on the road by 3:15pm and in Toronto by 8pm. I've just about finished off a Saturday of doing largely very little. It's also the first time in a while that I've been off the grid for a couple days... Internet and phone. It just didn't seem necessary to connect this weekend. This weekend is for myself-- not for anyone else. I got up early this morning and went for breakfast-- at the same place I go to most of the time for breakfast out here. That's mainly because the server is cute. Jamie always gives me two refills free beyond the regular one. Hey, it ain't much, but for a coffee fiend like me, it's gold. I finished off The Globe and Mail there... and then trekked down the street to Starbucks and got The National Post out of the way (a quicker job) with a Venti Whatever It Is That Starbucks Puts in the Cup. In the afternoon, I walked to Kensington Market and checked out clothes, produce and people. From there, I took the subway over to Greek Village, where I spent the rest of the afternoon outdoors at a cafe eating, sipping a nice cabernet, reading a book, and watching things happen. I waste a lot of time thinking about what it is that I like about large cities. One of my new theories is that large cities give you the opportunity to take part in all kinds of urban drama. I watched a group of guys and women pack up a friend's belongings and move him out while I was sitting outside this afternoon. The guy's friends were just the kind of friends you'd want to have help you move-- funny as all hell but deadly efficient. And the U-Haul driver executed a move on Danforth Ave. that I'm still not sure I saw with my own eyes. No one got in an accident and no animals were harmed. It's this kind of mundane, vicarious experience that I love about cities. You become a part of someone's political argument on the subway-- in this case about John Manley's Liberal Party run for Prime Minister. (I played the American who thinks he knows something and said that Manley doesn't have a chance.) You watch people and catch snatches of conversation; you see cute guys go by; a three year old on a scooter turns around to her mom and asks why that man over there is holding that other man's hand. Drama is too-- um-- dramatic a word for it. But it's the fabric of life. Yes, you can run across it in a city the size of the one in which I live. But you experience it in a much more pronounced way when you're among 6 million people. When there are so many people living around you, there's just that much more life. I'm eating this kind of experience up-- particularly this summer and particularly in Toronto. Well, that's the extent of this mal-formed thought about me and the big city. I'm still fleshing this one out in my head. You see, what I'm trying to figure out really isn't about why I like big cities or why I eventually want to live in one. What I'm actually trying to do is figure out why I'm here... now. Toronto has come to play a major role in my life this summer. Four trips and five weeks ago, it was a fun weekend jaunt to the city with a couple friends-- an opportunity to take advantage of cheap hotel rates and show our support for Toronto, which was in the grips of SARS and an unwanted travel advisory, courtesy of the WHO. It was a cool opportunity to meet Soblo and go dancing. Since, it has become something else. Toronto has become a refuge-- a quiet zone away from the parts of my life that aren't quiet right now. There's the ex back home. He's no longer my boyfriend, but he's still my roommate. Defining what that means and how it affects the way we interact has created an atmosphere of uncertainty around the house. He's around far more than he used to be... and I've basically had to retreat to my room to find a private space. I like my room but it's kind of a prison when it becomes the totality of your base of operations. In Toronto, I have my room at the Courtyard Marriott. It's all mine and it's quiet, clean and sparsely lit every single time I slip the key in the lock and open the door. Ah... another little scrap of certainty. And so it's a place to hide? hmmm... I hadn't thought about that way. It's less that I think, than a space in which I can exist as I want to. Kind of like home is. So for now, I think Ann Arbor is where I live and Toronto is home, when I can get there. I didn't say any of this was going to make much sense. I'm surprised you even read all of it.
I went to the doctor yesterday and they poked and prodded my shoulder... made me take off my shirt and stand in front of a variety of people (why does that make me uncomfortable?)... made me get 5 x-rays. The only thing they didn't make me do was wait-- which was too bad because I brought the newspaper with me with plans to finish off at least a section or two. Who would have thought the doctor's office could keep waits under 5 minutes? So I have a few weeks of physical therapy ahead. Sucks. But I can still work out. Right? I mean, they didn't tell me I couldn't. Even if they did, it wouldn't stop me.
I got one of those mobile phone earpieces that lets you talk to someone without holding the phone to your ear. Actually, I've had one for a long time, but I never used it. Then, my friend Chris got this urlLink earpiece that combines the microphone and the earpiece, so there's no mic hanging down somewhere on the cord or a boom dropping down the side of your face. It's a cleaner look. Alright, I'll admit it. I bought it because it's cool and I wanted it. There... I feel much better now. It is kind of convenient for driving. Even though with Sprint PCS, there are precious few places where you could actually plug in the earpiece and then put the phone in your pocket. The phone is hanging on to a whisper-thin thread of signal and holding it in your hand is the only way quite often to keep it from dropping the connection. Good workout today. I'm pushing harder, beginning a major re-shuffling of the workout and increasing my calorie consumption. i've climbed from 146 lbs to 152.3 lbs as of today. My bodyfat is higher than I want it to be. But 6% is basically higher than I want it to be. I think it's around 9% or so, which gives me the luxury of adding cardio back into the workout after close to 2 years of not being able to do it. So cardio works its way back in. Caloric consumption is a major concern of mine because I would like to maintain tight quality control on the food I eat, while increasing the quantity of it. And of course, it's possible, so I'm playing around with some scenarios. I've done that kind of thing for years... I love playing with workout routines. I'm going to the sports medicine doctor tomorrow and I hope to come back with some ideas about the pain in my neck and shoulder. It's concentrated on my right side and there might be some compensation kind of thing going on for an earlier injury. It's low-level pain... but it does seem to be chronic and so it's worth doing something about, rather than just laying back and assuming it will go away. Of course, up until now, that's been my strategy.
I'm spending roughly 15 minutes a day on Friendster. I suppose this might be about 20 minutes more than it deserves. But then, I don't know. Seeing a visual map of the ways in which we're connected to thousands of people through just a few friends is enlightening... a lesson in how broad and resilient networks are. There's a lot of low-level flirting going on. "I think you're cute; too bad I live 3,500 miles away" is a common line. There's the mindless connection. "I love Star Trek IV... so do you!" That sentence is usually followed by "I think you're cute; too bad I live 3,500 miles away." I've been playing the game... complimenting strangers on their abs, their choice in books, their friends; flirting. I'm working on writing testimonials for all my friends. All very nice but quite inconsequential. Except that there are little surprises. Friendster's random "person chooser" picked someone yesterday in Chicago and presented him to me. He's connected to me through urlLink Jonno . All roads lead to Jonno, which is fine with me because Jonno is immensely cool. Profiles are profiles... but this one caught my attention because he included on his book list something by Italo Calvino. I scribbled a note and sent it off and got back the kind of response I would have wanted from someone who wrote me for the same reason. Nice conversation ensues with talented and thoughtful guy. It's fun to learn a little bit about him and exchange a few ideas. That makes Friendster worth it, in my opinion. So many people run around disparaging all kinds of interactions on the Internet. In the early days of the commercial Internet, the naysayers went on and on about how none of us would ever go outside anymore; we would all become recluses without the capability of interacting with real human beings. This complaining has morphed into "most weblogs are vapid," and "most interactions are superficial" and any number of other accusations. Yep... so what? Most radio is vapid, voice-tracked crap. But Fresh Air is quite good. TV? There's Six Feet Under... or West Wing or whatever show you happen to like. The Internet? If you make nice connections with interesting people, and exchange a few ideas... that's good. Enjoy it. If this Friendster thing catches on, will the word become a verb? Scary...
Wow... a bunch of crazy twists and turns this day has taken but in the end, how cool! First, lunacy. I put a potato chip on the outside of my window sill this morning. I've seen a number of pigeons hanging around lately. They're peeved that workers are upstairs on my deck doing spring cleaning kinds of repairs. The guys have been up there off and on (mostly off) for about 6 days now, doing this and that. And the pigeons have had their lives disrupted. Who knows where their nests are. They sit patiently on the edge of the roof waiting for all of this to be over so they can get back to... cooing, or whatever it is that they do. So anyway, I left a potato chip out on the ledge of my downstairs (the building's second floor) window. Not so much to make them feel better, but to see if 1) they would notice it, and 2) they would eat it. It's a Baked Lay's Chip. There's not much going for it, except that it's salty. mmmm... salty. I emcee a charity event tomorrow during the day, which means that I don't have any "studying" to do for work tomorrow. Which is so nice. I felt like a normal person today when I got off work at 1:30. I had already worked out for the day, so I dropped by the house, (checked on the potato chip: still there), walked across the street to the coffee shop to read for a while. Mark came by and we drifted off to Pancheros for a burrito and then walked around campus enjoying the nearly perfect afternoon. We parted ways around 7 and I walked over to the bar to read for a while... only to meet up with 5 friends there. A raucous dinner ensued and I got out of there around 9pm. This is a day like a lot of normal people have. Work is 8-10 hours and no more. There's time for taking it easy, resting the mind, reading. In another two months, I'm making some big lifestyle changes... and this is the life I'll be able to lead. I'm so excited, I can't wait! My friend D is leaving Michigan after living here for two years. I'll miss him dearly but he's moving on to Denver and to a high profile LGBT position with a urlLink major brewer . He's one of the closest gay friends that I have but this just means there will have to be more roadtrips to Colorado in the future and I can't think of any situation in which that's a bad thing. By the way, for regular readers who pay attention to initials, this isn't D, my ex. That's another D. This is getting complicated. I feel like this recent period of somewhat increased sexual activity is drawing to a close. That's fine with me. When I felt it, I went with the flow and now I see no need to prolong it. I used it as an opportunity to explore myself and my feelings about sex... particularly to explore some of the ways I've long been uptight about sex. I learned some things and I laid a few issues to rest... and the result is that I feel more connected to my feelings about sex than I probably ever have been. I've written in somewhat vague terms about a couple of my experiences here-- not as titillation. Frankly, I had sex 6 times in 7 weeks. This would hardly qualify as promiscuous in most anyone's book. But I wanted to write about a few of the things I experienced because there were a couple of important milestones that I passed along the way. It was eventful, fun, safe and thus, a good experience. But there's nothing permanent about it. I do not understand Americans and this SARS thing. "There were a few more cases today," said someone, ominously, speaking of Toronto. This was immediately followed by stories of cancelled trips. I stayed quiet. I'm tired of even bringing it up anymore. It's now past 10:30pm and time for me to sleep. This is my new plan... to bed by 10:30 so I can get as much as 6 hours of sleep a night. It's sad to say but that's about double my average on weekdays. And it's my own damn fault. Not tonight, though.
It's been a quiet sunny Sunday afternoon... the kind of day I love to spend alone with the paper, a big brunch and good music. I heard "Peg" (yep, classic Steely Dan) the other day and this morning it was such a sunny beautiful day outside that I burned it and drove around for a while listening to it and the Oakenfold remix of Justin's "Rock Your Body." Talk about opposites. But you know how it is. A sunny beautiful day demands certain sounds and beats. And it was just what I wanted today. urlLink Submeat raves today about a new mix from Go Home Productions. It ran on Britain's urlLink XFM and the MP3 is now on the urlLink GHP website . My god is it wild! Thomas calls them mashups... is that what they are? I'm sure he's not wrong... I've never known what to call them. Anyway, the mashups are amazing... and just what your musical mind wants-- Justin on Michael. Absolutely. Download, listen. Burn, listen. News Capturing Attention Update on urlLink Prince William : likes school, likes sports better, loves music, loathes getting up early. Girls? Not a word. urlLink Aung San Suu Kyi is in urlLink "protective custody" again as Burma's government cracks down on the pro-democracy movement. The government fears her immense popularity, which-- by all accounts-- continues to grow. With summer at least unofficially upon us, urlLink the New York Times Book Review has released the urlLink Summer Reading List . I tend to read more urlLink non-fiction than fiction, so here are some picks from the list that I've read so far and can recommend. urlLink Coal by Barbara Freese urlLink Faster than the Speed of Light by Joao Magueijo urlLink First Off the Tee by Don Van Natta urlLink God's Secretaries by Adam Nicolson urlLink Krakatoa by Simon Winchester urlLink Reefer Madness by Eric Schlosser Speaking of which... back to books!
Post-gym... waiting for the shower to warm up... I just gotta say, urlLink isn't Jimbo damn good looking in that fu? I bugged him about this privately earlier this week but I thought I should bring my fascination with his new look into the open. There I've said it! :) LOL more to come, blogheads.
A big thanks to Slate for taking the time to explain why we really could benefit from the urlLink Pentagon Futures Market . The market has been at the center of a political firestorm for the past couple of days... with Congressmen and media pundits lining up to denounce it... calling it "harebrained" and "offensive." As usual, it was a lot of bluster... signifying nothing. The major points of the Slate article: 1) Markets are surprisingly good at predicting events-- from Presidential elections to the fall of Saddam Hussein. The often outperform the experts. 2) The collective judgment of traders is often quite accurate because marketing are particularly good at uncovering and aggregating pieces of information. 3) Traders have no other incentive than making the right decision... no political pressures, institutional biases. The real argument, of course, is whether it's moral to make money on predictions that might include terrorist attacks or government coups. But last time I checked, we were paying CIA specialists to analyze the terrorist threat. Last time I checked, we were also paying Al Qaeda informants to pass along information which might help us predict when and where the next attack will come. Besides, what we've been learning recently is that intelligence can go wrong when it's subject to political and bureaucratic pressures. Politically, there was not much that could be done once the proposed market was framed as a way to make money off of terrorist acts. But shame on the Congressmen who were too cowardly to defend the market for what it is and can accomplish. And shame on the media, which, as happens too often, simply reported what it was told without bothering to ask questions. I'm enjoying using some of my spare time to catch up on goings-on among my weblog friends... urlLink you , urlLink you and urlLink you among many others. It's been a long couple of months trying to get things wrapped up but now the long expected moment has arrived and passed, I can bask in it and revel in the new-found sense of space.
I had a little party for a few friends associated with work last night. It was another one of those moments that I've been experiencing over the past couple months-- rediscovering what it's like to kick back and have a really good time. I have this great deck overlooking downtown. And I never use it. But last night, I filled it up with colleagues from work. This has been a good week. I've been taking it easy for the most part... doing a little work in the early mornings... and then going home early. There are all those things I've been planning to do for months, that I'm finally getting to. Little things like vacuuming the truck, paying a couple old parking tickets, reading the papers, cleaning the house more thoroughly, tinkering with the workout. It's also been nice to spend more time with friends. Here's an interesting conversation I had with my friend Matt the other day: I was mentioning spending time with a friend-- a nice guy but someone I wasn't that close to. This particular friend likes to hang out regularly, but the conversation is never that relaxed... and I'm always happier when it's over. He's not a bad person... but he's somewhat demanding and a drain on resources. So this brings up an interesting question: are we giving our time to the wrong friends? Don't get me wrong... friendships shouldn't be subject to cost-benefit analysis. Even our closest friends are going to be an emotional drain on us from time to time... just as we are sometimes to them. That's what friendship is about-- give and take... being there for each other. If you turn the question into a series of questions, I think this becomes more clear. How much time do we have to spend with our friends? How much of that time are we spending with the friends who are most important to us? Is that limited time going first to the most cherished friends? As I've thought about it over the past few days, I've come to the conclusion that up till now, I've allowed my limited time for friends to be claimed by just about any friend who wanted it. I found a few telling contrasts. For instance, there's this friend I was talking about earlier, who is nice but claims more time in my schedule than I would normally give him. Compare him to another guy I'll call Bob. I see Bob at the bar quite often. We usually talk and it seems like every time we talk, it's a great conversation. He's an older guy, smart, charming... a caring person. And I'd love to know him better. And yet, my interaction with him is entirely based on chance-- if he happens to be at the bar when I'm there. See where I'm going? Of course you do. The people who mean the most to us should get a higher priority in our lives. It's all about being more proactive about the time we have for friends... and not letting the ones we really enjoy, slip through the cracks. Like my friends Matt and Justin, or Terry, Tim, Brad, etc. So what about the others? I don't think you just walk away from them. But if their friendship isn't as high on your priority list... then the amount of your time that they command should be proportional. In practice, I do this with my closest friends. But again, it's those other good friends who usually get shafted. The key is being proactive. I need to be the one reaching out to those friends and suggesting times to get together. Then I'm less likely to have my schedule controlled by others.
My first weekend of the new way of life... but not much was different because of a variety of events... AND a visit from my friend Joe from Milwaukee. Joe and I go back about four years... and although I don't get to see him often, we manage to keep a friendship of pretty decent quality alive and flourishing. So Joe kept things hopping on Saturday and Sunday. I had an event Saturday night and then a birthday "hangout" party at the bar for my friend Matt. So what am I going to do today? Well, first of all, I plan to leave work at 9am. And I don't intend to return to work until tomorrow. I want to follow this 4:30-9am work schedule for two weeks. I see no reason not to. I don't have an office... and I don't have any work to do. So there ya go. buh-bye. Yeah right. Yesterday, a friend asked me what I was going to do today. I said, work till 9am, buy groceries, clean the car, clean my apartment, work out, read the paper. Friend: what will you do tomorrow? Me: probably give up and go back to work for the whole day. My birthday is Thursday... so I'm trying to decide just how little of a celebration I want to have. I've never been much for big birthday celebrations. I like birthdays. I'm not one of those guys who fears each birthday... getting older or whatever. I just don't see much reason to get all wild and crazy about it. It'll probably be one of those "come by the bar on Thursday and have a drink" kinds of things. Now that I'm living alone again... I'm resurrecting an old idea I've had about my apartment... the loft as coccoon. A couple years ago before I got a roommate, I wanted to create a kind of sanctuary in the loft... a warm place to retreat from work.. a place to welcome friends and hang out. We're back to that now. What does it mean? Probably, it means spending a couple thousand bucks at pottery barn, Pier 1, and Bed, Bath and Beyond. Right now, my place is passable... utilitarian, sparse. But it's all that little stuff that makes the difference... the vase here, the candle there. All that shit I know so little about. Oh, and then there's art. But a few of you emailed with some great ideas over the weekend, so I have a leg up on that part of the equation.
btw... a really good piece (speaking of pieces) in urlLink yesterday's Washington Post that does much to explain why things have gone the way they have in Iraq since the end of the war. The reporting offers insights into the poor policing of looting in Baghdad, the general lack of planning, resources and soldiers for the reconstruction, etc.
I guess I can put my Uday and Qusay voodoo dolls away. Good riddance, you bastards. I've been so busy planning this and that thing... running from work to the gym, the gym to home, home to bed... that I forgot about my birthday next week. I'll be 36... and yes, I don't give a fuck about that. There's so much stuff that circulates within the gay community about being "old"-- generally coming from twenty-somethings who don't have a clue... sometimes from thirty- and forty-somethings filled with a sense of defeat. How can I be old at 36 when I plan to live to be 130? hmmm... I feel like this could turn into the now-infamous, much-loved and often copied urlLink Addaboy "Fuck You" segment. But I'll refrain because actually I'm in a great mood.
Someone ran off with my copy of the Sunday NY Times yesterday. Actually, it doesn't suck that much... but after being gone for 4 days, I came home and found they left the other papers from Friday and Saturday. I'd read those papers in DC, dammit. :) I'd not picked up a Sunday Times in DC because I knew I'd have one waiting for me at home. Living downtown as I do, I sort of expected all of the papers to be gone. But no... only the one I wanted. If that's the only downer from a great weekend, well, then it wasn't so bad. In fact the weekend was great. I thrive on DC... everything from my friends there, to the pool, to the Diner, to Health Bar, Results... and all the other regular hangouts. And that sentence basically encapsulates everything I did for the weekend... accompanied by my friend Chris, his bf... and his retinue of friends. I got in some great dancing time... at Cobalt on Friday and Saturday night and at Nation early Sunday morning. I also had a great time hanging out with blogger pals Chrisafer, CoolRelax and Jimbo. It was Thursday night and I was so damn tired. Having 2 glasses filled with gin and kissed with tonic-- ah yes, The Duplex Diner-- didn't help. So I was sleepy beyond words, but it was still cool to meet the guys and chat for about an hour before all of us slid home to our beds. I'll be back in DC in August for a week! I come back to the final week of "life as it has been" for the past 6 years. I'm in countdown mode to the finish... and more than ready to move on with new challenges at work and more personal time. I spent a lot of time this weekend thinking about relationships... so there will probably be some long post about it here in the next few days.
Now that Art Fair has arrived, I feel kind of bad that I'm leaving and won't be around to experience it. Wait a minute... Nope, I was wrong. I won't miss it at all. Boy, I'm sure glad we have Republicans in charge... carefully monitoring expenditures... urlLink keeping that deficit in line . Yup... you can always count on fiscal conservatives to be cautious and prudent. Went to see "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" last night. The date liked it... I didn't. Actually, the words "total crap" come to mind. I don't know why I get so excited about mail. And yes, guys, I do mean m-a-i-l. When I was a kid, I used to keep an eagle eye on the box... waiting for the postal carrier to arrive with the goodies. This was long before I was old enough to get anything specifically addressed to me. I liked the JCPenney catalog because I could look at all the toys... and, in my early teens, it provided views of young men in underwear. Frankly, I liked any mail... even bills. It was stuff... delivered by a man who put it in the box outside... left for me to retrieve and take inside to Mom. The mail would come in the afternoon around 2pm. I'd look out the south window... watching for the carrier. My first warning would be when he'd arrive at the corner and park his postal truck. Sometimes, he just sat in there... doing who knows what-- maybe eating or napping-- but at last he'd get out and walk toward my house... slowly, slowly... closer and closer. I had to watch because we had a really old mailbox and the flag appeared to have broken off some time near the Pleistocene Era. If I didn't watch, how could I know if the carrier had arrived or not? The mail might sit in the box for several minutes. It might get stolen. It might get moldy or something. Special values in the catalogs might expire. When I was old enough to get mail... well, I went to town. Other guys were dating girls, washing and waxing their rusted out jalopies... I was ordering magazines and trying to get on catalog lists. Yes, I read the magazines... but I think the chief benefit of getting magazines was... getting them. Even now, this delight with mail lingers. I don't look for the carrier anymore. Sometimes I let a few hours go before I get the mail out of the box. Yesterday, a piece of luggage I ordered arrived. UPS delivered it to the general store below me. When I got home, I took the UPS notice off the door. I decided not to run downstairs immediately to get the box. I sat down... opened the lapper and checked my email. And then I realized I'm still standing at the window looking down the street: Outlook checks for new mail every 60 seconds. I grabbed the UPS sticker and ran downstairs to get my luggage.
The Art Fairs are about to begin... and already the general level of stupidity in the city is rising. And so are the prices. That's one of the best parts... that $3 bottle of water and those "special" Art Fair menus at the local restaurants. Ah well, that's the way of it anywhere there's a big festival. Prices in Toronto jumped upward during Pride. But what are you gonna do? In Toronto, business owners can use every dime to try to make up for the SARS debacle. (And by that I mean the American media's completely irresponsible reporting of SARS.) Here, I've heard there are some boutiques that depend on the four days of Art Fair for close to half their business for the entire year. Since I live downtown, I get the best and worst of Art Fair. There's plenty of people watching... and if you're lucky you can see some particularly hot guys. (And a lot of overweight Michiganians, gorging themselves on high-fat, high-cost food.) You also get to see a lot of stupidity... people driving the wrong way down our one-way streets-- that's probably the most common mistake. Either that... or there's the mistake of actually buying the over-priced art that the vendors are hawking. Well, let them make their money... I'm heading for the exit! I'll "enjoy" a day of Art Fair on Wednesday and then leave for DC on Thursday. Damn, we're just about halfway through Summer-- at least in spirit. So what have you not accomplished yet? I've not spent even one minute in a pool-- any pool thus far this summer. I'll probably take care of that this weekend in DC... but I'm certainly getting a late start. What else? I've not read one giant biography yet... or one big trashy novel. I've still not done one interesting thing worth writing about here. A few of us weblog writers take the summer off, pretty much. I'm trying not to... even though work has been imposing itself on my life in ways I didn't expect it to.
For those of you who love the Washington Post and live outside it's postage-stamp sized delivery area... you gotta check out the urlLink electronic edition . I've been using it for a couple of weeks and I love it. Yes, you can read the paper online at no cost. But paying a few dollars a month gets you the newspaper in the exact same form as you'd see it if you were holding it in your hands. For me, it's an easier way to read text on a screen and remain focused. When I read in standard HTML, I skim more and comprehend less, in my opinion. The electonic edition of the Post costs $10 a month, which isn't bad. You can read it when you're online... or download it as a .pdf file to take with you. I'm even considering switching my NY Times subscription over to the electronic version. For one thing, it costs less. And although it's small... I'll save a tree or two. Lots of tidbits I've been meaning to mention here. I finished reading urlLink "Life of Pi" by the Canadian author Yann Martel while I was in Toronto for Pride. Yes, I'm the only gay man who took one look at several hundred thousand gay men... and reached into his backpack and pulled out a book. Let's just say I multi-tasked. "Life of Pi" is amazing and brilliant. I don't read many novels, but I loved Martel's blending of everything from religion and philosophy too his defense of the modern zoo. A short quick read but you'll be thinking about it for a long time afterward.
I read the New York Times yesterday... kind of a victory because for a long time, I've been wanting to have the kind of time to read the paper or to pick up a magazine, or to go out with friends and have a nice time, knowing there wasn't a huge pile of work awaiting me-- despite ten hours at work earlier in the day. Well, life ain't always that pretty... but at least this is a step in the right direction. Three weeks and counting to some major changes in my work schedule. We'll see how this fantasy of more free time holds up! I've already been spending money based on that fantasy. Subscriptions to The Washington Post, Harper's, the Advocate, the New Yorker, Foreign Affairs-- stuff I've liked and read when I was able to-- stuff that I'd like to make a regular part of the reading budget in the future. It all seems so perfect, doesn't it? Sitting in a coffee shop... sipping from a big mug... turning the pages... on a winter afternoon. Whatever... but there I am... pursuing the fantasy. The Fourth of July holiday was quiet. The city where I live doesn't have fireworks and I made no effort to go somewhere to see them. Fireworks are great, but they're not exactly a cure for cancer, know what I mean? When I was growing up, the small town where I lived had an annual fireworks display-- and by that I mean a complete set of 20 individual explosives. The city fathers would set them off-- one at a time. So what I remember about fireworks as a kid was waiting-- watching one spectacular explosion and then waiting sometimes as long as 3-4 minutes for the next one. For years, this is what I thought "fireworks" was. I have no idea when I first saw fireworks on TV but I do remember thinking how amazing it would be to see many fireworks set off at one time. Huh... yeah, like everywhere else.
An excellent biceps/triceps workout today... and my body is telling me in no uncertain terms that it wants more-- more exercise, more sleep, a little more protein. I have quite a bit of growing to do to get back the size I lost. But we'll add another 5 pounds over the next couple months and see how it looks. I followed up the workout today with one of those classic trips to the store. The trip you're not going to make because you're well aware it's a bad idea to go to the store on an empty stomach. But there I was, pushing the cart down the aisles, my stomach feeling empty... my cart filling up rapidly. I got fuji apples, which was a part of the original plan. But then I saw the seedless grapes. The red ones looked so good! And indeed, they were-- the skins bursting with a pop in your mouth. So... grapes. A couple baking potatoes... see, a nice recovery. And I moved on to the potato chip aisle. A bag of baked tortilla chips flavored with lime and chile beckoned. But then, it was a small bag... and extremely low in fat... so I picked up a big bag of baked Tostitos. That was followed by a jar of what has to be one of the world's hottest salsas. By the way, the bag of the lime and chile chips barely made it home. I tore the bag open in the parking lot of the store and worked from top to bottom. (This is generally the opposite of how I work with guys.) The rest of the trip pretty much conformed to expectations but I still spent an extra $10 on impulse purchases. In the grand scheme of things it's small. And those lime and chile chips tasted great! A tip: if you eat a whole bag of lime and chile chips followed in short order by a half of a bunch of seedless grapes... it might be best to have a lighter dinner. Not, for instance, a heavy dinner of rice and beans. So many other things to write about... but no energy to do it. I can barely keep my eyes open... more later.
Ah, summer. At last. It's warm, it's sunny. There's work out the wazoo. What's wrong with this picture? Having said that, I managed to read the entire New York Times yesterday and it's been a very long time since I was able to do that. My friend Matt stopped by the bar last night to trade war stories from the work day. I'm amazed that couples can live together AND work together. Matt and his boyfriend have their own business and much of it also originates out of their home. Talk about the potential for open warfare. They handle things pretty well. I know another couple who work together-- not at home in this case... but they still spend 8 hours a day or more with each other. I guess you learn good communication skills that way-- or at least you should if you don't want to be at each other's throats. But I think if I was in that position, I'd eventually get sick of being around my boyfriend. I need space-- not just physical space, but mental space... a sphere of action that's my own. I'll share my work with the bf, but living it day to day? No, thank you. Matt brought up this point, and it's a good one: a lot of us need someone to bitch about work with sometimes. Most of the time, that's your boyfriend because he's probably your closest friend... but also because he happens to be nearby most often when you feel like bitching. If you work together, you kind of have to find someone else to bitch to. hmmm... what artwork describes me? Sometimes I think I'm a cross between a Jackson Pollock painting and a Mad magazine cover. But I'm trying for something a little less jarring as I start to replace the artwork for the living room. The roommate took the pictures we acquired over the last year and a half. I'm an urban guy, so I'll probably replace that classic picture of Grand Central Station in New York from the 1930's. Probably a piece of brightly colored modern art for the wall that people can see from the coffee shop and blues club across the street... and who knows what else. Art is never high on my priority list. I like it... it's just not on my radar screen most of the time. Suggestions? I have big stretches of white walls and high ceilings. I'm getting psyched for my trip to DC in a couple weeks... even though it's not going to be that long. Three days. Well, what are ya gonna do? I do need to take a longer vacation but that won't be until September... probably a trip to Colorado. I hate talking about work too much here... but what follows is the text of a press release we got yesterday. Bob Saget, currently developing a series for Showtime and best known as the star of the long-running television series Full House, is available for interview. In addition to his new work he can discuss his role as spokesperson for 'all' laundry brand. In a recent 'all' About Stains survey, American moms agreed summer is the number one season for food stains. As a regular stand-up comedian at L.A.'s Laugh Factory, the former host of America's Funniest Home Videos, and a father of three, has seen more than his share of outrageous spills, flying food and messy stains. And with summer finally here, there's no better time to talk about prime-time stain season. I wonder what hard hitting, thoughtful series he's developing for Showtime?
I'm taking a couple weeks vacation and so regular posts won't resume here until Labor Day... but I thought I'd take a moment to wish you all a good (unofficial) final week of summer!
I was at the gym when the lights went out yesterday. There were waves of flickering across the banks of flourescent lights and a cascade of clicks from the circuit box as the electricity dropped, returned, dropped again, rallied for one last stand... and then gave up the ghost. This was within five minutes of me making small-talk with the attendant about how great the AC felt on such a warm and humid day. Figures. I haven't read as much on the electrical grid as I'd like... since networks have always intrigued me. The were a couple of major articles about the intricacies of the grid that came out in the past few years and once I locate them, I'll post links here. But as far as last night was concerned, understanding how it worked or not made little difference: the power was out and we had better make the best of it. I did. I got back from the gym around 5:15pm, sealed the loft as best I could to preserve the coolness that remained, unplugged everything, showered and then looked around for something to do. Everything downtown was closed so there was nothing to eat... but I did manage to discover a fresh bread delivery from Zingermann's at their store downstairs. I bought a couple big loaves of crusty farm bread, retreated upstairs, opened a bottle of wine, laid on the couch, munched on the bread, sipped the cabernet and read The New Yorker. That was sheer bliss. For 90 minutes. Then, like all people with ADD, my mind started to wander. What was going on at work? I drove over there and what I saw wasn't pretty. They had carried a generator up five stories to the roof... where it powered a satellite system, a couple lights, a small mixer board in an alcove down the hall, a microphone... and the digital circuitry that connects my radio network to its transmitters. It was dark, hot, humid, chaotic. I loved it. Well, except for the hot and humid part. Give me a disaster any day and in my professional capacity, I'd be having a ball. But give me an air conditioned environment in which to do it!! I left, praying the power would be on by morning. I got back home and went to the bar for a couple of drinks. That was all I could afford. I had $20 in cash and no way to get more or use a credit card. What a great night to sit outdoors! Humid but cool... bar patrons enjoying a few drinks on the patio. When it got dark, they pulled out the candles and we sat in twilight. I wish it hadn't been cloudy here last night. What a moment to see the stars, right? We stayed long enough to get offered free ice cream, which I turned down... and free chocolate cake, which I didn't. I got up at 4am and went to work in the dark... work now darker, warmer, more humid and only a little less chaotic than the night before. The next 5 hours was a continual repeat of the same information... my voice transmitted to all of Michigan, northern Ohio, western Ontario... talking about boiling water in Detroit, passengers stranded overnight at Detroit Metro, a refinery fire south of Detroit. I talked to Michigan's Governor shortly before 9am and she said while she was happy that her lights came back on overnight... she was going to have a word with others at this weekend's National Governor's Association meeting about the age and stability of the grid. A few flickers and the power surged back on late this morning... far ahead of schedule according to some of the predictions. And so now it's once again cool in my loft... it's raining outside... thousands of people in the area have a day off from work. In fact, I think every single one of them is over at my coffee shop across the street. Parking is free because the attendants aren't out today. And life returns to normal. And yet... here's the thing. I have questions... as I think we all do. The news channels are talking about the "Erie Loop" and how it has been in need of replacement for years; they're talking about the stability of the grid in general... the need to make the systems more redundant... what it might cost. They're asking what I think are important questions about the security of a system that could be attacked in one location and throw thousands of communities across a wide swath of the country into chaos. They're asking about those generators that were supposed to work but-- whether because of poor maintenance or a lack of preparation-- didn't. I don't want to make too much of this because for most of us, losing power was an inconvenience; no lights, traffic gridlock, no Internet. But when the power goes out, the gasoline stops pumping at most stations. Water becomes questionable and supplies of fresh water grow scarce. Prolonged outages tax the generators at hospitals, police stations, fire departments, nursing homes. While I'm probably the last person to get overly concerned about homeland security... the largest outage in North American history points to the fragile underpinnings of our sophisticated society. It would take little to cripple it.
I've been toying with taking a couple weeks off from the weblog. I've been toying with this idea for a couple weeks. Interesting... because for a couple of weeks I've been taking a partial vacation from the weblog anyway. So... add that all up and you have-- what? Hell if I know. Bottom line is... I probably will. But I might not. You figure it out. The Blaster virus is causing all sorts of problems. One of the expected results is a lot of screaming at Microsoft. In urlLink today's Washington Post , Allan Paller at the SANS Institute complains that Microsoft's consumer-based software doesn't contain enough security measures. This is true. And I'm rarely against complaints about Microsoft. But protection against viruses is a shared responsibility. I'm always surprised when I peek at people's desktops and see the Windows Update icon in the corner. Many of us got the patch for this virus last week or even earlier because we took some responsibility for our computer and clicked on the icon to install the update. Or we installed virus protection software and kept it up-to-date. We expect Ford to manufacture a quality car, free of defects. But if we never change the oil, we're going to run into trouble and guess who's to blame? The Microsoft situation isn't as clear cut. But again, the security of your computer is a shared responsibility... Microsoft's and ultimately, yours. What amazes me is the system administrators who apparently did nothing about Blaster, despite weeks of warnings. The Post reports the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration closed at noon yesterday after its computers were infected. The computer network at the US Court of Federal Claims crashed. hmmm... does nothing to improve my view of your average sysadmin.
"The Simpsons Fuck Each Other" hmmm...
i> WHITE HOUSE RELEASES REDACTED VERSION OF CONSTITUTION Twenty-eight Pages Deemed 'Too Sensitive' The White House today released an edited version of the U.S. Constitution minus twenty-eight pages that were deemed "too sensitive" to be shared with the American public. The altered document was "hand-redacted" by Attorney General John Ashcroft using a "Marks-a-Lot?" magic marker, the White House said, with the goal of removing the ninety-four percent of the original document that could have adversely impacted national security. In an official statement, the White House commended the changes, saying, "The redacted version of the United States Constitution is not only a much safer document, it is also a much quicker read." At first glance, the edited version of the historic document appeared to be missing some of its most memorable passages, including the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights. In the newly redacted version, the Second Amendment protecting the right to bear arms climbs up a notch to become the new First Amendment, "where it should have been in the first place," Mr. Ashcroft said. President Bush, speaking to the nation about the changes to the Constitution, read from a redacted speech that had over twenty thousand words excised from its text, leaving only sixteen words intact. Moments after delivering the speech, however, Mr. Bush disowned responsibility for those sixteen words, saying, "I have no idea how they got in there." The White House later released a copy of the controversial sixteen-word speech with all sixteen words blacked out. In other news, on Wall Street today shares of the Avery Corporation soared on news of increased demand for its popular "Marks-a-Lot?" magic markers.
Her name is Sugar. The urlLink 4yo Rottweiler is sweet but "Sugar" for a name is just a bit too much. I made only a short visit to the shelter yesterday and saw her while Matt and I were there. So sometime this weekend, I plan to drag Big Todd there to look at her. Not that I could just pay the adoption fee and walk off with her. My landlords don't allow pets-- officially. But they have made a couple of exceptions since I've lived there... including an exception for a Golden Retriever. It was also a quiet dog-- I think I heard it bark once in all the time its owner lived there. I might be able to convince them to accept another big dog in the building. And since I've changed my work schedule, I finally have time to devote to a dog-- although maybe not as much time as a puppy would require. A 4yo that's already trained, altered, fully vaccinated... might be a good opportunity for me to make a comparatively easy entry into dog companionship. Well, we'll see. I want to give this some thought. And I'll have a few days to do that. Up goes my weight again... to 157 pounds... at one point, 158 lbs over the weekend. That makes 11-12 pounds of weight gain since May... with another 8-9 pounds to go by November. I'm really pleased with the gains, since at my age, gained weight tends to accumulate in all the wrong places. So far, this hasn't happened. I haven't increased my caloric consumption too much... but I have been sleeping more and I've been working out longer and more intensely. With 30 minutes of cardio, I now expect a 2 hour workout 4-days a week. Two other days, my workouts are closer to 90 minutes. And on the 7th day, just a 30 minute cardio workout, unless I decide to take that day off. With this kind of a schedule, sleep and clean eating is key.
A couple of important stories about black men who have sex with other men. They may not identify themselves as gay or bisexual... in fact, they're quite reticent about acknowledging any sexual contact with other men at all. The term "down low" has come to stand for this kind of contact. Many of these men on the down low are HIV positive because they have sex without condoms-- keeping consistent with the aura of the street thug, which appears to be desirable stance for these men-- hypermasculinity. The New York Times Magazine yesterday featured an urlLink excellent piece about men who are on the down low. Today's Washington Post picks up the story and delves deeper into the urlLink lives of women who get infected with HIV by men who are having unsafe sex with men on the side. There's also a wider issue here... the divide between the "Gay Community" made up largely of white males... and African-Americans who see much of the gay community as effeminate... espousing values they don't agree with. Also notable is the belief many have in the black community that being gay is turning one's back on family and black pride. George Chauncey is quoted in the Times Magazine piece, commenting on how gay indentity is a relatively recent phenomenon. James Traficant Update Before I forget about it later today when I post... the latest news on James Taficant, from urlLink Al Kamen in today's Washington Post: Former Ohio representative James A. Traficant, now doing time for bribery and racketeering, has allowed his supporters to form a presidential exploratory committee. "The battle to free James Traficant and to evict the Socialists and 'free traders' from the Democratic Party is now underway," campaign spokesman Marcus Belk said, according to the Associated Press. "Someone buy the Washington establishment a bottle of Maalox." Will wonders never cease?
So yeah... a birthday party at the bar last night. And a HUGE cake... six inches high and probably 18" inches across. Decently long and thick as hell... every gay man's dream, right? Chocolate cake, chocolate frosting, raspberry filling... all personal favorites. To prove I wasn't a total prude, I had two pieces. But it soon became apparent that there was much more cake than there were partygoers to consume it. I started offering cake to everyone in the bar I ran into. Let's just say thank god for lesbians, who don't appear to have cake issues. Gay men turn into nervous nellies around cake. Offer them a slice and they shrink from it in horror. It was damn hard finding interested takers for the cake last night... but we were successful, thanks largely to a couple of friends and a few guys who got a piece right as the bar was closing-- apparently deciding that if they couldn't find a boy to take home for the night, at least there was some other sweet comfort available.
It's August first... the day after. No hangover... although I do personally feel a level of Sushi Overload, the morning after my birthday. Sushi Overload is that feeling you get about five minutes after you wake up the morning after eating too much sushi. That certain "what the fuck!?!?!" feeling. Speaking of what the fuck... the Michigan Governor's Mansion has been undergoing a few repairs and such. Among the latest discoveries... mercury, PCB's, asbestos, lead-- and my personal favorite, black mold. The house is only 45 years old... but like many Michigan highways, apparently it's been neglected for a long time. The previous Governor, whom Democrats refer to affectionately as "Fat Tub of Lard", apparently never cleaned behind the couch. The current Governor is living above the garage while the work goes on below. The Free Press home repair columnist says urlLink "I'm glad I never ran for Governor." Toronto held its big wing-ding this week. The Rolling Stones and other bands played for hours to about half a million fans. As urlLink Soblo noted the other day... it's likely to have been urlLink a big day off for Torontonians... with little promotion to create tourism. In typical Michigan fashion, we've found a way to carp about it. The headline this morning: 500,000 Canadians Attend Concert; Create 165 Tons of Garbage to be Trucked to Michigan . Is this the way we're going to treat every event in Ontario in the future? Soblo Parties Hard: Michiganians Smell Three Bags of Trash; Particularly Upset About Chicken Wings and Ranch Dressing
I love those long goodbyes at the airport. They embrace in the public area between the rental car counters and check-in. For a long time, it's a tight hug... each looking away from the other into the distance. Then they pull away and look into each other's eyes. There's a quiet moment and then he pulls her close. Lionel Richie is playing over the speakers. A couple minutes later, I'm checked in and heading for security. There they are again... at the "Ticketed Passengers Only Beyond This Point." Another hug, a few more kisses. I'm thinking, where could he possibly be going that they're both so overwrought? Where do people in Des Moines go when they go on distant and difficult trips away from their loved ones? I soon discovered the answer when I saw him take a seat at Gate C1... for Minneapolis. Huh. You could be gone a year and still a trip to Minneapolis wouldn't merit that kind of emotional display. He seemed quite dejected at first, but for the past several minutes, he's been looking my way... which makes me wonder if he's going to miss her as much as she misses him. Hmmm... there's so little to distract one at the airport at 4:58am. At least in Des Moines. There's a public wireless network but it won't give me Internet. There are lots of fat people walking around, but that's really more sad than funny. Obesity and near-obesity seems to be an epidemic around here... if you base your assumptions on what you see on an average day in Iowa. Sometimes, I think we should be able to sue McDonald's and every other fast food chain for the long-term emotional and physical damage they cause people. But even setting aside personal responsibility for a minute, where would you stop with the lawsuits? The government has been feeding us a load of crap for years, literally and figuratively. The school lunch program might as well be lard and salt on a plate. And the nutrition guidelines are still more about appeasing agricultural and food processing interests than our health. Look at me... I'm Ralph Nader. I'm sitting next to an actual electrical outlet here at the Des Moines International Airport. (Slogan: "Really, We're Not Kidding.") Last night at work, a friend of mine was on the phone, telling a friend flying in that he'd meet him at the escalator when he got in. He paused for a minute, and then, in response to an unheard question, "This is Des Moines... there's only one escalator." So anyway, at most airports it seems to be nearly impossible to find an electrical outlet in the gate area. In Des Moines it's possible to plug in. So there you are... exactly what you'd expect from a world class city. I should write an email asking them to change the name to The Des Moines Airport Internationale . It's so foreign and mysterious... kind of exotic, like when a shop in West Des Moines remembers to put the accent on "cafe." It will be nice to get back home... to the mail... to the workouts at my own gym... to the bad-tasting coffee of Ann Arbor. To my boyfriend... whom I've missed all weekend. I don't like sleeping alone, so I've been hugging the pillow for the past couple of days. Ah, now that's about as sweet as the long tearful goodbye to Minneapolis. Heck, she could get in her car and drive there and she'd arrive only an hour or so after his plane lands! I'm going to be back in this territory next weekend... but next week I'll be here as the enemy for the Michigan-Iowa game. My friend Matt (I can say his name: I have 67 gay friends named Matt) has finally stopped pestering me to take him to see my parents next weekend when we're in Iowa. Thank god. That would be fun. "Hi, Mom and Dad... it's your son-- the abomination. I've brought my gay lover with me... yes the man with whom I take part in nasty sexual relations. I'll go into those relations in explicit detail and show you some pictures and a video clip on my Palm in just a moment. But first, meet my friends, another couple of guys who enjoy taking it up the ass." Not that we would be anywhere near my hometown. We'll be in Iowa City for the game... a five hour roundtrip from my parents' home. Not exactly the distance for a quick stop after the game. The funny part is that it took several conversations over a two week period to convince Matt that this was true. Again and again... Matt: "We should stop by and see your parents in Iowa." Todd: "It's a five hour round trip-- too much for a Saturday afternoon after the game." Matt: "Don't you want your parents to meet your boyfriend?" Todd: "That's not the point. It's too far away to make sense." Matt, in tone of disbelief: "hmmm." Finally, when I reached the point of total exasperation, he said, "I guess you may be right." You guess ? It's not a matter of guessing. We guess the number of pennies in a jar. We guess the actual intelligence of our President. We guess when an asteroid will strike the Earth and destroy all of civilization and every copy of "Deep Impact." We don't guess the distance between two established points. No one in America has done that since the Donner Party. (I realize I'm not addressing the separate issue of those who don't seem to know the way to San Jose.) Well, a day or two later... he conceded that the trip would take up way too much travel time to be worth it. But he conceded only after he consulted the map. I couldn't be believed without a fact check because I might be " biased ." What? I don't want to go to Arkansas... but I'm not likely to tell someone it's near the Dominican Republic. It's not so much "biased" as it is "know what the hell I'm talking about because I've been there." What I like about that long drawn out conversation he and I had... other than the comic potential... was the realization that many of us have these kinds of conversations all the time. Two people disagree about something... sometimes quite harshly... when the answer that would put an end to the disagreement is totally within reach. This is what wireless Internet is supposed to be for. Look it up! it screams... but we never do... that would ruin the fun! Mentioning Toronto (when was that?) reminds me how much I like Jean Chretien. You gotta love an old crotchety politician. This tussle over succession is fun to watch as an outsider. You have to smile at Chretien's "I'll go when I'm good and ready." A word of advice to Canadians: it's not that bad. We nearly had two presidents for a while in 2000. There was twice the hot air, but we made it through. Well, I've been writing for several minutes now... long enough to prove myself that it's nearly impossible to write anything interesting at 5am on a Monday. My god... what the hell am I doing at the Des Moines International Airport???!??!
Too many famous and important people are dying. This has to be stopped. A couple of weeks ago, I got up early for work and heard that John Ritter had died. That was kind of sad. Hearing one hour later that Johnny Cash had died made me feel awful-- not just because he defined and created so much American music over the last half century, but also because he was a great man. In Friday's papers, I read the obit of the scholar Edward Said. I was driving around listening to the CBC last night when I heard that George Plimpton had died. He was, no doubt, the closest thing we had to a Renaissance Man... the founder and only editor of the Paris Review. To quote liberally from the urlLink Washington Post obit : Mr. Plimpton had his nose bloodied by light-heavyweight boxer Archie Moore, cut his hand when he played goalie with the Boston Bruins, clung to a trapeze with the Flying Apollos and pitched to baseball great Willie Mays. It seemed as though Mr. Plimpton knew everyone. He played-- and lost-- a horseshoe match with not-yet- President George W. Bush, and was the subject, by name, of at least two New Yorker cartoons. He escorted Queen Elizabeth II while she was a princess, Ava Gardner while she was a movie star, both Bouvier sisters (later known as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Lee Radziwill), actresses Jane Fonda and Candice Bergen and poet Marianne Moore. He appeared in more than a dozen movies "Reds," "Rio Lobo," "Good Will Hunting") and on television's "The Simpsons." A fancier of fireworks, Mr. Plimpton's exhibition in Central Park became an opening shot in the Woody Allen movie "Manhattan." In 1968, Mr. Plimpton grabbed Sirhan B. Sirhan after the assassin shot Robert F. Kennedy in Los Angeles, and he was one of the men who pried the gun from Sirhan's hand and held him down. "I had my hands around his neck," he told the Associated Press last year, his voice fogging up. "Bad stuff." He was named a "central figure in American letters" when inducted last year into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the French subsequently made him a Chevalier, the Legion of Honors highest rank. But his real legacy, attorney Goodale said, will be his unpaid work on the tiny Paris Review, the magazine that introduced promising writers and established the tradition of interviews with renowned writers about the craft. The night before he died, he put the 50th anniversary edition to bed. I spent some time talking to Mr. Plimpton last year, a conversation I agonized over a long time because when talking to one such as he, one hardly knows where to start; one hardly feels worthy of the task. But he was amiable, pleasant and full good humor... just as I hoped he would be. A true gentleman.
I'm back home in the capital of Iowa for a few days. Des Moines looks better each time I come back. The city is in the midst of a massive transportation rebuild. The urlLink beltway around the city is done. But the freeway through the capital is getting a long-awaited refurbishing. The the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway is finally coming alive. The planners originally constructed it by piecing together a web of streets downtown. It was nice to give it one name, but it was basically a zig-zag pattern of other streets. Now, at last, a real parkway is taking shape. Downtown is also taking shape... albeit slowly. But let's face it. The kind of sidewalk, loft, coffeehouse, micro-brewery culture everyone wants takes years to develop. Important pieces are in place... but it's still pieces. Jane Jacobs was right. It's an organic process. The city is all aflutter this month over urlLink hipness . The urlLink October issue of Fast Company names Des Moines the hippest city in America. Are you sitting down? I bet you are now. Ok, pay attention first while I explain and then we'll start ripping this one to shreds. Fast Company likes the cultures of some of the city's largest companies. Yes, Principle Financial Group and some insurance giants offer good jobs and geat benefits. Housing is cheap. Schools are good-- particularly in the suburbs. People are friendly... uh huh. So, admittedly, a different definition of hip. Or maybe in these post go-go stock market times, we're rediscovering the truer, more earthy hipness. Kind of nauseating, isn't it? Des Moines is not hip. But that's alright. A friend of mine weighed in on the issue in his urlLink column in today's Register. His take: we're not hip... and we really don't care. Kyle writes, "As a rule, Iowans simply refuse to live up to the notions of hip or cool. We've visited [the] gleaming bastions of culture... and we've been content to return to our quaint farmsteads. Not because we're provincial, [or] rubes. We just don't care." He concludes that not caring is the ultimate in hip. Actually, no it's not. The bottom line: Iowans aren't hip. They never have been and they never will be. But they are useful; they provide an amazingly large portion of our food, grown on some of the world's most fertile soil. They're good people, decent people. They're less conservative and more concerned about social issues than you might think. And that's it. What's wrong with that? They'll always feel a little inferior. They'll always turn up their nose at the cultures of the coasts, calling it shallow and fickle. And they'll always latch on to any recognition those cultures give them as some kind of proof that they're not all that provincial or unimportant after all. That's the kind of culture I come from. I'm dealing with it just fine, thanks.
The outer edge of the hurricane came by us on Friday... leaving behind a great weekend... sunny and mild during the day and cool, almost crisp, at night. In fact, it was a perfectly timed weekend, with the rain arriving at 5am this morning... just as the work week was to begin. I made the rounds of the athletic apparel stores yesterday... amassing a collection of new Michigan sweatshirts, t-shirts, shorts, window flags for the cars, baseball caps, etc. All of this because I'm traveling to Iowa next weekend for the Wolverine's away game with a few friends. We have to show the colors. We have to be true to the school. We have to endure the jeering of Iowa fans... which is particularly hard for me to take because Iowa is my home state. I feel like I should wear something that indicates I'm from Iowa. No, I don't need to cheer on the Hawkeyes. I went to the "other" university (Iowa State) and barring an Iowa appearance at the Rose Bowl, I'll never feel the need to show my support for the Hawkeyes. But what about some shirt that says "I'm supporting Michigan but I'm also one of you." On the back, it would say "Don't hurt me." To my knowledge, there is no shirt like this. Too bad. Someone could come up with a whole line of Equivocating Wear... clothing expressing wishy-washy statements about issues ranging from football rivalries to the Middle East Crisis. There's a certain amount of surprise and perhaps even relief coming from some Democrats with the news that urlLink Wesley Clark 's entry into the campaign is already having a remarkable impact on the Presidential race. urlLink Newsweek's poll showing a urlLink slim Clark lead over all the other candidates is a good indication of how his entry has shaken up the contest. However, let's not forget that the Democratic candidate with the biggest lead so far is "Don't Know." The campaign is going to take a very interesting tone and flavor over the next few months. Where am I on this? Clark's entry has been expected for the past couple of weeks so the announcement brought no sharp gasps of surprise. But for me it has changed things. Clark is smart and ambitious. I have a great deal of admiration for him and how he handled the war in Kosovo-- his confidence, his sense of what needed to be done. I do think he has a strong grasp of military issues and the ability to take on Bush in what was pretty much unchallenged territory for the incumbent. And oddly enough, I kind of like the fact that he's largely a blank slate as far as domestic issues are concerned. There is time to mold him and create something. However, there's not much time. Clark has assembled a top-tier crew of operatives around him. Many of them are old Clinton cronies, which also sends an important message about the seriousness of this campaign and how much the party wants Clark to be a part of the race. There is enough time to put this thing together, but barely. And Clark shouldn't be making any slips like he did last week... appearing to change his views on how he would have voted on the question of the Iraq War if he had been in Congress. Dean, to my mind, is still the guy to beat among the Democratic pipsqueaks. Not because of poll numbers of the moment-- since the Newsweek poll shows him running second to Clark. But because right now, Dean is better organized and has well-defined, if changing, positions on the issues. But there's no doubt about it-- this race is incredibly fluid. While that means Clark can slip ahead with some deft management, it also troubles me that no one candidate has been about to marshall a commanding level of support among likely Democratic voters so far. Some pundits say Clark's quick rise is a sign of the voters' yearning for someone of stature to get into this race... and by someone of stature they mean Hillary or Wesley Clark. Well now... Clark is in. The strategist in me wants a clear leader to emerge soon so Democrats can unite and get down to the main job of turning Bush out of office. I've been fantasizing about a Dean/Clark ticket... and I know plenty others have been, too. Hmmm... maybe Clark/Dean? In the meantime, I think Moseley-Braun, Kucinich, Graham, Gephardt and Edwards need to leave the race immediately. But that's just me trying to clear out the underbrush. On the way to work this morning at 4:30am, I was surprised to see a small dog on the side of the street as I drove through the neighborhood. The dog was standing in the street over by the curb on the other side. It's one of those moments where the headlights capture the dog out of the corner of your eye and you brake quickly not knowing what the dog is going to do. But the dog just stood there. I parked and got out of the truck. I could see it standing at the curb. There was something uncertain about it. I couldn't tell if it was disoriented or hurt or what. The dog started to make its way slowly across the street. Was it injured? It wasn't limping but it appeared to be walking stiffly. I spent the next ten minutes watching it meander in a tight circle on the side of the street. It was almost always moving... but it never walked outside a 10 foot circle. It was like a slow pacing. I didn't know what to do. I was close enough for the dog to see me. I got down on one knee and whistled to it to see if it would come. But it didn't. And I didn't know if I wanted it to. I've always hesitated to approach an animal that was acting strangely. And it was dark enough that I couldn't see the dog's face. After about 10 minutes, I needed to get inside and get to work. I left reluctantly. About an hour later, I went back outside in the rain but I couldn't see the dog anywhere. I have seen it today at all... even though it's been on my mind all day.
You know, I think half the reporters in television are really in that business for one reason: they're hoping to have their chance to stand outside in 100mph hurricane winds. I don't understand it. Well, yes I do. People are ridiculous. That reasoning actually explains a lot of other things, too, now that I think about it. (Although I have to say it doesn't explain Isaac Mizrahi. Nothing seems to be adequate to that task.) Yesterday, NBC's Brian Williams and a reporter for the Weather Channel were out in high winds trying to measure wind speed, when a particularly strong gust picked them up and carried both of them down the street. It will go down as one of the more undignified moments in Williams' career. (Eclipsed only by all of his appearances on MSNBC.) The loss of dignity makes for great TV. So we were treated to approximately 1,327 repeats of that moment last night-- and it was a true cross-channel event... airing on NBC, CNBC, MSNBC and The Weather Channel. I'm sure that in the true spirit of competition, CNN and Fox News are even now trying to stage a similar stunt. NPR News reports that Noah Adams has been discovered in a ravine near Tiffin, Ohio. NPR staffers last saw the 5'2" former All Things Considered host attempting to buy a soy latte at the food cart outside NPR headquarters in Washington. Winds were gusting at 50mph at the time. The other thing I like about hurricanes is that often the story becomes secondary to news organizations covering themselves. Hearing that one of NBC's satellite trucks lost its dish in high winds is so much more interesting than flooding and people dying. Even tiny local stations have suffered. ABC 59 in East Buttfuck/Dipswitch, North Carolina lost a plastic lawn chair. I had a little time last night so I watched the first episode of the new HBO series " urlLink K Street ." I like it! But I'm kind of a politico. What I like the most about the series is the mix of reality and fiction. In fact, I'll just come clean and say I like the reality part better. It's great watching James Carville coach Howard Dean, handing him a punch line on the race issue, only to hear Dean use it in the last debate. I also like the series because Carville and Mary Matalin have great presence and style. Carville is a total whack job. I'd watch him eat a sandwich. Matalin always has this "what the fuck is he going to do next?" expression on her face. You see real life politicians and lobbyists, which makes it fun spotting the Famous Person. Like I said, we'll see how the fiction part of this series works out.
It's been a weird time in the workplace over the past few days. One of our colleagues committed suicide Friday night. That fact alone is shocking and disturbing... two emotions from a long list of many we're experiencing. But there's a deeper irony. Seven years ago, another colleague of ours committed suicide in the same manner... hanging himself. And last month, a former colleague of ours committed suicide... also hanging himself. It's highly unlikely they did it for the same reason. This isn't some cheesy made-for-TV movie suicide pact. But this third suicide has been particularly devastating to the staff. All of us have a different range of emotions. Over the past few days, there's been anger, grief, guilt... the gamut of expected responses. I won't give any more details because some readers know where I work and I don't want to reveal more than has been reported in the media. It's just all quite sad. So things have been a little somber lately. I could say "other than that, things are fine." As inappropriate as that might sound... it's the state of things. There's always less to write about when things are going well, right? But that's the case. I went to a Howard Dean house party Saturday night. It was a small group of friends-- about 10 die-hard Dean supporters, with the two of us sitting on the fence. There were cool appetizers, wine and a conference phone call from Himself. I contributed $50 so I could attend in good conscience, not because I'm jumping on board the Dean bandwagon. I don't have anything against him; in fact, I like Dean quite a bit. I'm just not ready to declare. And by that, I don't mean declare my candidacy for President. Although, everyone else is either running for President or Governor of California. Maybe I should, too. I have a little spare time. I could campaign on Wednesdays... I have 1-3pm open between the end of work and the workout. I could have a healthy lunch and talk about "the issues." Alright, to get back to something halfway serious. I haven't decided whom, among the Democrats, I would support. Read that, the Democrat who is electable. Dean is a possibility. Wesley Clark is announcing today; he's a possibility. The others? Either I'm not a fan, or they have no chance, in my opinion. I'd rather see the pipsqueaks withdraw so we can get more serious about the fight ahead. Yes, Gephardt is a pipsqueak. Edwards is a pipsqueak. Lieberman is probably a pipsqueak. Do I even need to mention Carol Moseley Braun or Al Sharpton? So anyway... I sat among the Dean converts... generally enjoying the conversation. When the faithful began announcing Dean's principled stands in favor of puppies, true love and mothers... I decided it might be a good time to take off. For my part, I'll hold off on an endorsement a while longer. I'm waiting to see how Clark and Kerry come down on the puppy issue.
A long-time colleague of mine took his life Friday night. I'll return to writing the weblog in a couple days.
We've seen the video countless times. The video camera is focused on a firefighter in the middle of the street. Then the camera moves up and away toward the north tower of the World Trade Center, catching American Airlines flight 11 as it slams into the tower. What I remember more than the image is the sound of the impact, as captured by the camera's tiny microphone. Sometimes, I try to put myself in one of those offices. The explosion coming as it seemed from nowhere... a flash of realization. Then vaporization. Or maybe I'm one of a number of people who likely caught a glimpse of the plane coming toward the narrow windows at 500 miles per hour. They say in moments before an accident that we see coming, our body goes hyper with the production of adrenaline and everything seems in slow motion. Or I imagine myself on Flight 11. Frightened, uncertain of what was really going on, hoping that the hijackers would land at some airport and demand money... anything... rather than my life or anyone else's. I suppose you could look at this as an exercise in morbid speculation... unnecessary and perhaps even distasteful. But I don't think it is. I want to know what people experience in moments like that. It's so hard for us to know because so few survive it... unless they were just far enough out of danger. And if that's the case, isn't the experience just a little bit different? It seems all the more sad to consider the attacks from this perspective. Thousands of ordinary people, going about their ordinary business, expecting nothing out of the ordinary... directly feeling the impact of an extraordinary and terrible event. Those who didn't die instantly spent a harrowing 60-90 minutes... either getting out of the buildings or realizing there was no escape. And what was that like? No amount of thought can produce the intensity of emotions that one can experience. Other thoughts ripple through my mind today: the American networks have resisted showing video of people jumping from the buildings before their collapse. Ric Burns' new documentary about the towers includes more extensive footage. There's no gore... no bodies hitting the ground. But seeing extended footage of people jumping and falling a thousand feet to their deaths is shocking and deeply disturbing. The footage is interwoven with the faces of witnesses on the ground screaming and crying. Watching a disaster unfold in front of you is horrible; you are aware that people are dead and dying inside. But seeing individuals leap to their deaths... fills you with the utter hopelessness of the situation. I think if we spare ourselves too many of the awful details, we won't understand just how horrible it was. So two years later, I still read accounts of eyewitnesses, I look for new video and photos. I'm trying to understand pain, anguish, suffering... so much of which I've been fortunate not to have experienced. Other impressions: the close call. NPR this morning featured an interview with 3 people who had breakfast every morning at Windows on the World, at the top of the north tower. They knew the waitstaff by name... smiled and said hi every morning. On September 11th, two of them finished their breakfast and walked toward the elevator. Just as the doors were closing, a female friend called out to them to hold the elevator for her. She got in, the doors closed... and they took the speedy ride to the ground, making small talk along the way. The doors opened, they walked out... and at that moment, Flight 11 struck the building. It's said they took the last elevator ride down before the attack. None of the other 170 people in the restaurant survived. In the interview this morning, the woman said, "Sometimes I think, 'What if I had decided to have just one more cup of coffee? What if I'd stopped in the restroom?'" Life is so fragile.
I watched filmmaker Ric Burns' urlLink new documentary about the World Trade Center last night. It's a massive 3-hour piece on the WTC, from dream to design to public battles to completion to icon on New York to destruction in the terrorist attacks two years ago. I'll have more to say about this tomorrow but it was an impressive piece of work. The documentary explored the battles over constructing the WTC in great detail. That's a good service because I think many of us either have forgotten how acrimonious that debate was. And some of us are young enough not to have known much at all about that. There are excellent segments about the effort to create a workable design for the center; the construction of the two towers; New Yorker's initial indifference to and ambivalence toward the towers; and Philip Pettit's amazing high-wire walk between the towers that helped the World Trade Center gain its place as a focal point of the city. The 9/11 attacks and the destruction of the towers occupies about one-third of the documentary. It's nearly the best piece of documentary work I've seen on the Twin Towers. The scale of the disaster is overwhelming... as is the sadness. The tone of sadness is correct. There's little reference to the fact that this was a terrorist attack. For the purposes of this documentary, that's not a major point. What does matter is the human toll-- more than 2,900 lives. The documentary notes the question asked of former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at a press conference the afternoon of the attacks: How many have died? To which Giuliani responded, "More than anyone can bear." That's the central point of the tragedy, after all. If you missed the Ric Burns documentary, chances are it will come around again soon on PBS. The documentary is the new ending to urlLink Ric Burns massive series on the history of New York , so it's likely to be added to the current DVD boxed set featuring the other installments. By the way... that series is a must see. If you missed it the first time around, check out HBO's 9/11 documentary urlLink "In Memoriam: New York City 9/11/01." It airs tomorrow night at 7pm ET on urlLink HBO, HBO Latino and HBO HD . By the way, the HBO documentary is available on urlLink DVD .
In all my life, I've never thought about candles as much as I have in the past couple weeks. But then, I'm a gay man and I suppose it's expected that I have some special collection of candles in my apartment. Over the past two weeks, the regular viewing of close to 61,250 candles has led to the selection of about 10 of them for the loft. They look nice; very nice. They smell nice. When you trim the wicks like you should and all that sort of thing, they burn well and last a long time. I now buy bags of 100 tea candles without blushing. I have polished river rocks on my Asian-style candle stand. There's bamboo growing on the windowsill. Now, all I need is an ambient music CD and a water fountain and I'll have to start wearing a kimono when I'm at home. But hey, it's nice and homey and cocooning... just what I've wanted. And my boyfriend has a good eye for that kind of stuff. He's calling it "Queer Eye for the Queer Guy." A couple people wrote to ask about the curriculum for the "How to Be Gay" course at the University of Michigan. I'll post it below so you can get a sense of the reading and viewing for the coming semester. There's some pretty interesting stuff. Our attempt to check out Mars at the local observatory had to be abandoned Friday night. There were too many people trying to do the same thing and the long was long enough that it was soon apparent that even if the observatory open house lasted twice as long, it would be impossible to accommodate everyone who wanted in. It was also a positively chilly night out there on the roof of the urlLink Angell Hall Observatory . Particularly for the first Friday in September. The bf and I shivered on the roof with a crowd of others until he had had enough. Then we took off down the street for something warm at Starbucks. Alright... the reading list for "How to Be Gay." Books Neil Bartlett "Who Was That Man? A Present for Mr. Oscar Wilde" DA Miller "A Place for Us: Essay on the Broadway Musical" Esther Newton "Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America" Herman Melville "Billy Budd, Sailor and Other Stories" Films Wilde The Importance of Being Earnest Gypsy Mildred Pierce All About Eve All About My Mother Querelle Pedagogue
The old urlLink Michigan Central Depot is an emblem of Detroit: the measure of grandeur that the city once enjoyed... and the depths to which it has fallen. It stands out starkly along I-96 as you approach the Ambassador Bridge crossing to Canada; a towering hulk. These days, it's a wonder that such a urlLink mass of rubble is still standing. But it is... and it's structurally sound. Fifteen years are the last train pulled out of the station, the City of Detroit is urlLink seriously considering the massive effort to restore and renovate the building. The latest word is that it might become the new police headquarters. Here's a urlLink photo album of the building... which retains a certain grandeur despite its decrepit state. After witnessing so much of the grand architecture of Detroit torn down, burned, looted and vandalized... I think we're all ready to see a famous landmark saved.
I absolutely, positively hate it. But not for the reason that many others hate it. I don't hate the impersonal nature of voicemail. I like voicemail for a its benefits-- the ability to leave someone a message when they're not around; the ability to manage one's time and the interruptions of the phone; the opportunity to leave a message for someone without having to interrupt them. That's all great. What bugs me is accessing voicemail. And again, here's a distinction: accessing voicemail on my mobile phone is easy. I press a button and the phone connects and begins playing messages. Accessing voicemail at work is another story. "Please enter your password, followed by the pound sign" begins what always turns out to be an array of options that's long and annoying, all of them involving hitting keys on the phone. It drives me crazy because it's slow and frankly, old-fashioned. For the last 6 years, I haven't had a phone at work for that reason. But now that I actually have an office, I have a phone and voicemail. The horrors were about to begin. But my employer has come to the rescue. The university has just inaugurated a new unified messaging system. There's a lot of blah-blah about bringing email and voicemail together. But the part that has me most excited is that I can now access my voicemail on the web. Messages are stored as audio files and I can click the mouse to listen, advance, go back... whatever. Thank god for this advance!! And someday... after the folks get my phone line actually working properly, I'll be able to use it. I have a few trips coming up this month... including a trip to Iowa to be on TV for a few days. Then there's the Michigan-Iowa game in Iowa City on October 4th. I and another couple of friends are planning a weekend in Iowa City... for the game and general hanging out. Believe it or not, there are things to do there. It should be fun. Then there's Chicago. That's probably around mid-October. And then there's my own selfish wish to spend a couple days in Toronto. I went with a date as a couple to TO in August but I think I might want to take this trip by myself. I like TO primarily because, for me, it's a solitary place where I can hangout, be a nobody, and catch up on reading. I think everyone needs a balance of both kinds of relaxation. Another week of heavy weightlifting before I go lighter. For the past 2 weeks, I've doing basically one muscle group a day-- at least as much as that is possible. It's allowed me to push each body part to new levels of strength and I've liked the tight focus I can get each workout by just focusing on one thing. But 3 weeks of that in a row is enough, I think. I'm not exactly sure what I'll do next week. I'm nearing my target weight of 162 lbs and my plan has been to go to a more intense higher rep/lower weight workout for 3 or 4 weeks once I got there. I might switch to that regimen even if I'm not exactly at the weight goal. A change up is a good thing and after 3 weeks of heavy weights and major gains, it might be a good idea to give myself a slight rest.
I'm auditing the now infamous "How to be Gay" course at the University of Michigan. The coverage urlLink in the urlLink press had urlLink been close to saturation levels recently-- at least for a non-Iraq, non-Bush, etc. type story. Naturally, Professor David Halperin chose the title to draw interest, cause questions and generate some publicity (read controversy). He has succeeded and while after 3 years the class still creates controversy in the fall, maybe we shouldn't be surprised since this has been a year of considerable discussion, celebration, angst and dire predictions about the state of LGBT rights. The course isn't about how to become gay per se , of course. It's an exploration of the ways in which gays and lesbians create their own culture and identity-- particularly how they appropriate elements of heterosexual culture for their own-- from Judy Garland to Gloria Gaynor to opera and physical fitness. The course will be rigorous, with a heavy dose of dense reading. David Halperin has played a key role in the effort to legitimize and enhance gay/lesbian studies at the university level. He's read and written extensively on the subject and he assumes a level of engagement and study that one might not expect from a course with such a catchy name. But there will be plenty of opportunity for independent thought and writing... and every Tuesday evening, we'll watch films, ranging from The Importance of Being Earnest to Gypsy to All About Eve and Querelle . I'm excited about the course and the opportunity to think more deeply about issues of LGBT identity.
It's never officially over after Labor Day, but I get the funny feeling it might turn out to be that way this year. Here, the temperature dropped abruptly with the arrival of 9/1... upper 60's to low 70's during the day and low 50's at night. On top of that, it's been raining all day... which makes it seem even more fall-like. Well, bring it on. My favorite season is autumn... the perfect time for nights out and walks around town with someone you love. I've taken my late-August vacation from the weblog... so now, an update. Nothing's changed. Moving on. Actually, it's been an eventful month. There was a weekend in Toronto. There was a week in Washington, DC that was enjoyable as usual... even if I did get a bad case of allergies there that only just now is receding. Damn that ragweed. I've had huge successes in the workout. Major gains on all fronts... pounds lifted... muscle gained. I hit 160 pounds last week... and once that stabilizes at around 162, that will be a gain of 15 pounds since May. I've managed it with very little fat gain, too... which keeps the look closer to the level of definition that I like along with the kind of muscle that I think my body can support. Overall, it's a decent look. I'm very pleased. The company I work for just finished a major move... everything boxed up and carried down the street to a new headquarters... brand spanking new. Frankly, I'm glad to be working in a facility where the AC works like it's supposed to. No more sweating bullets on hot days. And I've just finished up a relatively quiet weekend... doing a little painting around the loft, sprucing it up here and there... buying plants and stuff... making preliminary plans for HDTV. Summer ends quietly... but then that's the way I like it. Bring on Autumn!
There comes a point where you could eat oatmeal all day and you'd never get full. I'm not sure what that point is, but after consuming 6 packets of oatmeal, I feel like I've nearly reached it. Yes, 6 packets... 750 calories of cholesterol reducing, high fiber, plain oatmeal. I'm starving. I may not last the remaining 53 minutes of my work day.
I bought one of the new 802.11G wireless units this weekend, since the price is good and Netgear has good rebates. My old wireless box is first generation and can't be accessed expect with a serial port. None of my computers has a serial port so the box was something of an anachronism and now its history... having served 3 years and 2 months as my electronic tether to the house. The new box is prettier, more functional, and supposedly much faster although I'm not really taxing it that much. Especially since I got tired of people at the coffeeshop downloading like crazy from it and decided to close it off to all but a handful of friends with a password. Comcast is offering up to 3 MBps service here now, as in much of the country, so I'm going to test that for a month to see if it meets my "needs." If so, the 1.5 MBps DSL circuit at $59.95 a month will disappear, to be replaced by $19.95 a month for 6 months of cable modem service. It's not about brand loyalty... it's about maximum pipe for minimum cost. hmmm... kind of like sex. On the movie "Must See" list... Kill Bill.
I've reached my goal of putting on 15 pounds. It's been a long project lasting several months but in the past few days, my weight has held steady enough that I feel safe in making the pronouncement. It's been a long time coming. I was loathe to gain it in the first place. But it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and I've managed to keep bodyfat at a decent level, which is usually where guys trying to put on weight will cheat. I don't feel the need to gain any more weight at this point. I'm eating enough and I'm working out like a dog. Do dogs work out? I'm about to spend a little time talking about the workout. Some readers don't like this and consider any writing I do about working out as either narcissism or a personal display of a new kind of body fascism. To them I say, go jump in a lake. Actually, I'd like to be more specific but this is a family weblog so I'll hint that it includes the words "fuck" and "yourself." I've been on a much tougher (for me) routine for the past couple of months and the results are really beginning to show in terms of muscle thickness and popping veins and all that sort of stuff. I've been operating on the following principles: 1) devoting one day to each body part is an excellent way to fully exercise and exhaust your major muscle groups; 2) exercise plans that revolve around 4-5 exercises of 3 sets can accomplish the goal of fully exhausting the muscle group, but often they don't; and 3) a more intense and longer workout featuring more exercises and sets can exhaust the muscle group and promote better growth. In practical terms: I work out 6 days a week, devoting a day to each major muscle group: chest, back, biceps, triceps, shoulders and legs. Workouts average 70-90 minutes in length, not counting cardio. Each workout features 7-10 exercises, ranging from 3-5 sets apiece. The goal is around 30-33 sets per workout. I aim for 6-8 reps in each set. Exercises are grouped within the workout so that the ones which work the muscle group most broadly or classically (flat bench press or preacher curls) are at the beginning... with smaller range exercises (cable crossovers, front lat raises) relegated to the latter half of the workout. Free weights get top billing, with machine or cable exercises coming in the last half of the workout as "finishers." Sleep and nutrition are going to be key factors in a workout like this because the goal will be exhaustion of the muscle group. This isn't an all-purpose workout. But in the past few weeks that I've used it, I've had good results. No workout plan should go on forever and I'm likely to switch away from this one by Thanksgiving or Christmas.
One sure sign that it's getting colder is that my plants have started to show some yellow and brown. This is a new experience for me. This is the first autumn in which I'm "with plant." Well, not exactly. I killed a bonsai tree in late 2001/early 2002. Now, I'm slowly choking the life out of three plants-- all of which are quite beautiful; none of which I can identify. I've had two of the plants by the big windows that face the street. They're drafty and the chilly nights haven't been good for the plants. I've moved them away... although in my house, that's no guarantee of their survival. Why am I so warmblooded? I'm not sure. But I think my favorite room temperature is about 65 degrees F or even slightly cooler. This doesn't please my plants; nor does it please my boyfriend. He jumps into bed and pulls the covers up to his nose when he stays at my place. He also puts his cold feet up against me to make the point. Unfortunately, his cold feet actually feel nice so I often don't get the point. Oh well... give and take, right? I guess I'll just have to close the windows on nights when the temperature drops to 35F.
A second Presidential term provides an opportunity to shuffle the deck. While I hope American voters don't give George W. Bush that chance... if he does get it, he ought to say goodbye to National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice. urlLink The New Republic Online has a urlLink good piece that lays a sizeable chunk of the blame for post-war Iraq at Rice's feet. When it comes to postwar Iraq, there is enough blame, as Robert Kennedy used to say about Vietnam, to go around. Much of that blame rightly accrues to the Defense Department, which at times seems to approach the postwar as a theological exercise--over-investing in unreliable Iraqi proxies, committing insufficient numbers of U.S. troops, and, in a reprise of Saigon's five-o'clock follies, regularly assuring us that all has gone according to plan. It has not. But the fault hardly rests with the Pentagon alone. The White House--and, specifically, the NSC--bears ultimate responsibility for the conduct of the war in Iraq and its aftermath. It does so because it is the responsibility of the president and his national security adviser to have the final say on matters of foreign and defense policy and, as such, to mediate the frequent disputes between State and Defense. They have done neither. Rice is a good political scientist, but her success at NSA has been overrated and I think she's received the light end of the stick from media looking to find scapegoats for the general mess in Iraq. The TNR story, and many other reports, have pointed out the near open ideological warfare between the State Department and the Pentagon. The National Security Advisor is supposed to be the referee between the two factions. Frankly, I think few would have the strength to keep Rumsfeld and Powell apart. The level of disagreement and the lack of cooperation between State and the Pentagon are as high as they've ever been. But Condoleeza Rice doesn't seem to be holding her own in that battle. TNR reports she's been overpowered by it. The result is two policies on Iraq, North Korea, Iran, etc. Ultimately, the President bears responsibility, of course. And while many leaders encourage a certain level of internecine squabbling and competitiveness in the upper ranks, usually those leaders are strong enough to set the course once their captains have defined it for them. Bush doesn't seem to be capable of exerting enough force to keep the competing ideologies in line.
I thought I would make it through relatively unscathed. Yesterday was Opera Day in the so-called "How to be Gay" class I'm attending at the University of Michigan. It's the class that explores gay culture and how gay men have drawn on elements of straight culture to create a culture of their own. You can't very well do a class like that and skip opera... although from the attendance yesterday, a lot of my classmates tried to. Our professor is devoting two class periods to talking about opera and watching clips. Yesterday was the first of the classes and we'll finish up tomorrow. So, as I was saying, I thought I would do pretty well. I'm no fan but I have a working familiarity with opera-- and sometimes just understanding it a little bit makes it much easier to tolerate it. And tolerate it, I did. Almost until the end. But there's only so much over-the-top drama and hystrionics that one can take-- which is another reason why the California recall race was mercifully short. I sat through clips of Maria Callas from the 1950's. She was a true diva... and in a film of a recital in Paris, you can feel her persona. Her eyes barely glance at the singers and the audience assembled. This performance is about her and she delivers a magnificent rendition of Bellini, her hands clasped at her chest. It was kind of fun and an absorbing character study. The clip that finished me off was a 30 minute segment... the end of Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier. No one takes longer to say or do anything than in an opera. Concepts like "let's go" get transformed into highly orchestrated, florid arias... "I must be going... and yes, it's time to be gone." etc... with the chorus chanting "She's going, going, going" in the background. Someone gets stabbed and what follows is a five minute song in which the hero, in the throes of death, coughing up blood, too weak to stand, belts out the most powerful performance of the opera. That's the only way to go. Opera isn't meant to have a strong connection to real life. Opera is highly stylized camp and sometimes it's great fun. But yesterday, I'd had enough. I've only seen one opera in person, and I didn't think it was all that bad. But it's just not my thing, I guess. The last 30 minutes were excruciating-- primarily because basically the only thing that happened in that 30 minutes was a Queen discovering her lover loves someone else; and then she felt bad about it; but life goes on. See? 10 seconds to say it... 30 minutes to sing it.
This is what I'll call my play after tomorrow's interview. I'm kind of excited to talk to him, since he's been someone on my "to interview" list for several years. Why? Well, I can't deny that he has relic status in the gay movement. He's a founding father-- not in the Stonewall sense... but from the era of AIDS when gay politics and culture grew up and men had to start thinking about more than where they were going to get dick next. I think part of what attracts me to him is how much he's alternately revered/reviled by the community. I suppose your politics determines your view... or whether or not he called you a "murderer." As he did whole groups of people. urlLink Anthony Fauci was a target and considers himself a friend of Larry. Ed Koch was another target and has never forgotten it. Kramer has probably lost more friends than most of us will ever make. The thing about Larry is that he has had an impact far beyond what anyone might have expected 20 years ago in the early days of AIDS. He's revolutionized medicine, the way doctors and patients interact... and the way the FDA goes about approving new drugs for patient use. At times, he's been shrill and his constant recriminations have caused even sympathetic ears to go deaf. But how many people have actually accomplished that much when they got angry? He is a relic. Interviewing him is like getting a chance to interview John Adams. But Larry Kramer still has something to say to the gay community-- about living with AIDS, and responsible behavior to avoid getting it in the first place.
In recognition for outstanding achievement in airfield snow and ice control, Willow Run Airport received the Colonel Bernt Balchen/Wilfred M. Post Award during the annual International Aviation Snow Symposium in Buffalo, NY. The award, which is sponsored by the Northeast Chapter of the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE), is presented annually to outstanding snow removal teams in four commercial airport categories. hmmm... ah, but read on: The Balchen/Post Award was named for Arctic aviation pioneer and Norwegian explorer Col. Bernt Balchen who piloted the relief plane for the first arctic rescue. The award also honors co-founder and former chairman of the International Aviation Snow Symposium, Wilfred "Wiley" M. Post, commonly known his efforts to recognize airport personnel as part of a team while demonstrating expertise and outstanding efforts in the removal of snow and ice from runways and taxiways. We move on... So, it was a nice weekend in Iowa City, Iowa. This despite the Wolverines' march downhill... to 20th place in the AP rankings. Michigan's 30-27 loss to Iowa looks closer than it actually was. Michigan played a mostly brilliant 10 minutes in the first quarter. Then, apparently, many on the team went home. Something happened. Iowa woke up and what followed-- particularly in the third and fourth quarters-- was mainly Iowa's domination of Michigan. The Wolverines made a valiant effort near the end and did, in fact, nearly close the gap. But a series of mistakes and a fake punt fiasco made the loss inevitable. Barring a highly improbable series of losses by other leading teams in the Big Ten, and the collision of Venus with the Sun... Michigan won't be going to a major bowl this year. It's almost certain we'll get some kind of bowl invitation: the Outback Bowl... the Capitol One Bowl... The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Bowl... The International Aviation Snow Symposium Bowl. No more about the game. We'll set that unpleasantness aside and talk about the good time we had in Iowa City. It's a great college town... a lot of natural beauty... a beautiful campus and downtown... very little to do on a Saturday night besides the bars... a few good-looking boys to distract one from the relative lack of anything to do. We walked around the campus, ate dinner, stopped by a coffee shop and hung out for a while before heading back to the hotel. Yesterday, I drove back... stopping for a few hours in Chicago since it was such a beautiful day. There's nothing quite like Chicago on a beautiful, sunny October afternoon. An update: Detroit's Mayor has urlLink announced he wants to make the old urlLink Michigan Central Depot building the new home of the city's Police Department. This is always a good time to trot out the link to urlLink The Ruins of Detroit ... one of my favorite webshots showing the faded glory of Detroit, a good portion of which has been razed, sadly.
In the midst of a busy week... a minute or two to note the controversy over the leak about the CIA operative. First of all, here's a link to urlLink Robert Novak's July 14th column in which he named Joe Wilson's wife as a CIA operative on weapons of mass destruction. I've been keeping a small number of facts in mind: first, the calls to several journalists about the CIA employee came from two highly-placed sources within the administration; second, the next set of leaks, providing information on the source of the first leak... came from senior administration officials. If I remember correctly, the Post and the Times use those words to refer to anyone at cabinet level or higher. Correct me if I'm wrong, politicos. The Washington Post talked Saturday to a "senior administration official" who said that two top officials in the White House called at least six journalists to reveal the name of the CIA employee. The official told the Post it was "meant purely and simply for revenge." To summarize, the leaks most likely came from the White House... and the allegations that they did have also came from people in the White House. There was a lot of backpedaling at the White House yesterday... toning down the harsh denials that any official might have played a role in naming the individual. Why? It's obvious, of course. Everything seems to point quite clearly to a leak of the name from the White House and the two names that come up repeatedly are Vice President Dick Cheney and political advisor Karl Rove. Today's Washington Post reports the results of a urlLink poll it conducted with ABC News. It shows a large majority of Americans would prefer an independent counsel to investigate the matter. The newspaper "The Hill" has a urlLink story today indicating that Republicans in Congress are doing everything they can to stay away from this... even though some of them say "despicable" crimes may have been committed. The bigger question is whether those who leaked the information knew they were violating the law. Bob Novak says he didn't know when he wrote the column. Did Dick Cheney and Karl Rove know-- assuming they were the sources of the leaks? One finds it hard to believe that old political hands like those two would be oblivious to the legalities.
I wrote this piece about 3 or 4 years ago for my website. I still like parts of it, so I thought I'd trot it out for your holiday weekend reading. If anyone is qualified to talk about this subject, it's me. I spend an average of 3 hours a day, every day of the year, in coffee shops. So… all this time spent sipping coffee and poring over books, writing email, composing essays like this, or talking with friends, has given me an insider's perspective. Allow me to use this unique knowledge to answer a few of your deepest questions. Why do coffee shops stock so many different kinds of coffee? They don't. Coffee shops sell two kinds of coffee: regular, which is slightly acidic and frothy; and burnt, which they call "French Roast." So if there are 6 pots behind the counter, what should I do? Ask for "coffee." If they get short with you, it's because they realize you've figured out their secret. Smile broadly. Why are drinks given names that include words like "breeze" and "sparkle?" It increases the price by a dollar. The staff also wants to see if you'll actually make a fool of yourself by requesting the product using the full name. What about drinks named with adjectives like "sassy?" The above comment holds for these drinks, too, but I wouldn't get too worked up about it. However, under no condition should you order a beverage named "pungent" or "moldering." What about drinks named "coolers?" What about them? Why is the condiment counter always so messy? People are stupid. We've evolved to invent the Internet, the heart transplant and the pets.com sock puppet, but we haven't figured out how to get the cream in the cup. Kind of scary, huh. It's easy to prove how universal this problem is. Show up at a coffee shop 4 1/2 minutes after it's opened and you'll find half a packet of sugar, two teaspoons of cream, a few drops of skim milk, several bite sized pieces of cherry scone and a half-eaten bagel on the condiment counter. Oh, and the clean forks are swimming in 2 inches of spilled milk and cinnamon. (I'm impressed. Not only did they spill the milk. They had the good taste to garnish it with some cinnamon afterward.) No, it's not little Faeries of Messiness scurrying about in the night. It's not the Master of Darkness, although I'm sure he'd be terribly messy with a packet of sugar. The enemy is we. Us. Whatever. I've watched harried businessmen open sugar packets with such gusto you'd think it was a jar of Viagra. I've also seen angst-ridden students staring into the distance, their eyes brimming with tears, the stream of pouring milk traveling slowly to the edge of the cup and then gently down into the clean fork container. Well, I'm getting long-winded so to summarize, people are stupid. What's biscotti? who knows? At my house, when stuff gets old and hard, I throw it out. I'm just saying… Does the coffee shop staff want to kill many of its customers? Actually, this question really interests me. So, in my typically straightforward manner, I sent my friend Nersi up to the counter to ask Emily. He didn't return for several minutes. When he did get back finally, his hands gripped the table edges as he relayed Emily's response. Bottom line: yes, the employees do fantasize about killing you-at least if you're an annoying ass. In fact, not only does Emily know for a certainty that she'd like to kill annoying customers. Apparently, she's spent many a sleepless night thinking of several horrifying and highly original ways in which to do it. One of them would work only in a coffee shop with an open cesspool nearby… but the others are possible just about anywhere you can find common household appliances. Um, which coffee shop does Emily work at? I'm not telling. How do I go about choosing the best coffee shop for my needs? I recommend a mix of the following criteria: 1) What's the name of the place? If it involves a pun on some synonym for coffee, you're fine. If it's named for feelings, dead exiled writers, or a four-legged animal that roams the far north, you have the right to ask a few questions first. 2) What's the atmosphere like? Is it so dark you're not sure if it's open? Does the music mix lean heavily toward out-of-tune French folk singers? Is Wednesday "Angry Lesbian Night?" This might not be the right place for you, my friend. 3) Is it a gay friendly coffee house? First, to clarify. By that, I mean, is the shop friendly to gay clientele? I don't mean to say, is the gay clientele friendly to each other? Of course, if you're straight, this isn't likely to be a priority for you. But if you are gay, and want to test the waters, just walk in the door and say, "Dick" rather loudly and happily, as though greeting an old friend. If three or more guys look up quickly, you've found your new home. If you like to drink strong coffee from tiny cups and speak in whispered tones about Sartre and "The Other," choose the shop with the little round tables high off the ground. If you're the type of person who orders drinks that are seven words or longer… or include the word "frappe"… ask for Emily. Once I find a good coffee shop, how long should I stay there on my visit? Either until you get all your work done, have memorized all the songs on the CD's, or have had so much coffee that you can't hold the cup without spilling most of it on the condiment counter. Should I get the blueberry muffin or a bagel with cream cheese? Yes. Why do perfectly behaved children suddenly begin crying and screaming the moment they're in the coffee shop? One day we'll have the key to this mystery, and that's the first step toward stopping it. Why are there so many angst-ridden people in coffeehouses? I'm not sure, but I think they've mistakenly ordered the "French Roast."
No, I'm not talking about President Bush's surprise trip to Baghdad yesterday. I'm talking about the existence of urlLink the International Council of Shopping Centers . The rather sparsely designed website features a publication of the month ( urlLink "Winning Shopping Center Designs" -- order several now for the gift-giving season) and it also reminds us of the vital role shopping centers play in our national security. The site notes the elevated threat of terrorist attacks and features a special button that says "Shopping Centers on ALERT." Unfortunately, this portion of the site is off-limits to those without a password-- the security details about such foundations of our democracy as "The Coffee Beanery" are for members only. So lets salute our shopping centers... promoting consumption of unnecessary goo-gas while protecting the institutions we hold dear-- Congress, The Presidency, The Limited, Linens and Things. Related, albeit tangentially, to the goofiness above, is a urlLink nice piece by the Globe and Mail's correspondent covering the Lee Malvo trial-- the link via urlLink Soblo , who is refreshingly handsome and Canadian-- not to imply that these are mutually exclusive traits. from urlLink Waremouse : apparently we're looking for the same guy. Kyan: Grooming Guru urlLink Which Member from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy is your type? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla You can tell a vibrant neighborhood by its discarded gum. So says urlLink today's Washington Post ... quoting a number of city leaders in DC and elsewhere. They note the subtle, subliminal effect of those dark splotches of old gum left on sidewalks... accumulating with each passing year. "They contend that cleanliness equals safety in the minds of visitors, and that old gum -- along with graffiti and window bars -- subtly dissuades shoppers, tourists and even potential residents and commercial investors. The gum, in other words, hinders the improvement of neighborhoods, slowing the revival even of ones that are seeing major new investment." There are already parts of DC where workers use steam-driven "gum removal" machines and businesses in other areas, like Adams Morgan, are considering it. There's a good urlLink op-ed on gays in the military in today's Times. Nathaniel Frank of UCSB attacks the argument of miliary cohesion that opponents of lifting the gay ban often use. And he argues that the zealous enforcement of "don't ask don't tell" has put the nation's security at risk. He cites the dismissal of the gay translators last year and the generally lower quality of those hired in their place. A couple choice excerpts: The growing understanding that the gay ban is bad for national security may explain why even those who once supported the ban now support letting gays serve. The former judge advocate general for the Navy, Rear Adm. John D. Hutson, who was involved in the development and enforcement of the policy, recently said that the ban is a failed policy whose elimination would strengthen the military. A Fox News poll conducted in August shows that 64 percent of Americans now favor allowing gays to serve openly in the military, up from 56 percent in a similar poll taken in 2001. The debate over gays in the military was never really about balancing civil rights with national security. Britain, Israel, Canada and Australia are among 24 militaries that lifted bans on gay soldiers without undermining unit cohesion or combat readiness. These experiences show that the choice is not between gay rights and military readiness. It is between prejudice that compromises national security and equality that enhances it. And that's no choice at all.
This is urlLink me . The New Yorker profiles Irving Tobin, a man who reads the entire New York Times every day. It usually takes about two and a half hours. Ah, but the vicissitudes of life; Tobin is behind in his reading of the Times. He is "One year, five months, and four days behind, which places him in late June, 2002." The 79 year-old Tobin of Elizabeth, NJ, began reading the Times in 1975, in addition to several other papers he was already reading. Over time, he had to cut out the other papers. "I realize I'm not going to catch up, but I like to believe I will,' he said the other day. When the Times went on strike in 1978, he lagged by only nine days. By 1998, he was almost two years behind, even though he had quit reading the Sports section years before. "I just had to give up something," he said. He also skips Escapes and Circuits. Saturday is Tobin's biggest reading day; he gets in about four hours, two before synagogue and two after lunch. 'I make slight advances, but they're very, very slight,' he said. He keeps up with current events by listening to the radio while he drives to work. If he thinks he might be about to learn the ending to a particular story he's following, he will turn it off. He doesn't want to spoil the suspense." I knew I wasn't the only one obsessed with reading the newspapers every day. My requirement is completing the NY Times and the Washington Post every day, and the Toronto Globe and Mail on Saturdays. I keep my Washington Posts, but they're not clogging up my closets. I read the papers electronically and I save the Post as a pdf file and burn them to CD. If I followed Mr. Tobin's practice of not moving to the next paper before I was finished with the last one, I'd be years behind. But I still try to finish every copy, as though I'm on some quest. Which I am... the ultimate quest to know everything. I don't expect to be successful, but that's not the point of the quest, in my opinion. hmmm... maybe I am certifiable.
The answer is obvious. Isn't it? I mean, one can appreciate cranberries. One can like cranberries. But one doesn't love cranberries. One doesn't love creamed corn casserole. Stuffing, though. What other time of the year would you willingly eat bread that's been soaked in the juice of one animal and baked inside another? I don't have many memories of the Thanksgiving meal beyond the hours of preparation beginning early in the morning and continuing until 3 or even 4 in the afternoon, culminating in a frenzied feast lasting less than 30 minutes... finished as we leave the table and crawl to the couch. When I was a kid, the preparation seemed impossibly long. I couldn't understand why it took so many hours to cook a turkey-- basically strips of meat stretched over a small skeleton. Everything else took forever, too. The turkey would finally emerge from the oven to begin the long "resting" period. Resting for what? It hadn't been doing anything. It had been resting since death a few weeks before. It had rested enough. How long was the resting to last? It didn't matter because the turkey would finish resting, and join the other dishes on the table, long before the mashed potatoes were ready. I came to suspect that my parents regularly forgot about the mashed potatoes until the last minute. The boiled spuds would hide out in a pot at the back of the stove. Not out of sight, necessarily, but probably out of mind. Then, just as I was getting ready to gather the brothers at the table, my mother would reach to the back of the stove and bring forward the giant pot of potatoes. It's at that point that I greatly regretted my parents' commitment to mashing potatoes by hand. Eventually, they decided that hand-mashing wasn't slow enough, so they began putting the potatoes through a ricer. The result is pure heaven to eat, but the extra few minutes of delay is maddening... especially as starvation begins to cloud one's awareness of the passage of time. Somewhere back in the mists of time, my dad took upon himself the responsibility for the sweet potatoes. My dad isn't the type of person you'd call a cook. But he is a tinkerer, so making something in the kitchen is, for him, a process of tinkering. Thus, over a period of years, he transformed the sweet potatoes from a dish of said item with a little butter and brown sugar... to an increasingly fantastical production that little resembled the vegetable that lent the dish its name. Somewhere underneath all the cranberries, nuts, raisins, sauce and the helmet of melted marshmallow... there lay a sweet potato. Every year, he would add something else. Sometimes, we were victims; the year he tried adding capers comes to mind. I, for one, refused to eat them. I liked sweet potatoes, but with butter and brown sugar. I'd eat my cranberries separately, thank you. For a long time, I demanded a separate dish of sweet potatoes that wasn't infested with all that other stuff. In 1996, I finally relented and began eating Dad's Sweet Potatoes Tout le Monde . The family torn asunder has been united once again. Whenever I talk about Thanksgiving dinner with friends, usually a couple of them will mention green bean casserole. You know, the casserole made with green beans, cream of mushroom soup and covered with french-fried onions. They usually bring it up this way. "And who can forget green... bean... casserole!" And they say it with a certain tone of voice; something like "Let's put on a show !!" You can almost hear the orchestra tuning. And there's this wild look in their eyes that makes one think of the word hootenany . The assumption, of course, is that you have eaten green bean casserole; you are eating it; you will eat it in the future; and most important, gol' darn it, I love that dish!! As if once you taste of this dish, you can die. Usually, after this disturbing display, I say two things: I've never had it, and I don't like it. What follows are expressions of great surprise. I look human. Am I a communist? You can see the confused emotions playing across their face. "You've never had it?!?! How do you know you don't like it if you haven't tried it?" Well, let me see. A can of mushy, slightly gray, beans; a can of processed cream of mushroom (?) soup; and a can of onion pieces that have been fried. Brought together. Not by chance because such a thing would never occur naturally. The hand of man must be involved. The three substances are confined to a glass baking dish and subjected to heat. Why heat? I'm not sure. It's not as if anything is being cooked. And if it's just being warmed, what does that say about the state of these "foods" before you opened the can? At this point, the pro-green bean person is staring at you blankly. He comes back with, "It's really good the second day." What dark conspiracy brought about the widespread acceptance of green bean casserole? Was it a special campaign by the Institute for Gelatinous Food Research? The Alliance for the Promotion of Partially Decomposed Food? Maybe I'm making the wrong assumption. Maybe it was a grassroots movement-- a fascination with smelly fried onions, canned to preserve their... smell. Like the Velvet Revolution, a kind of Creamy Coup. For years, I've felt like I needed to make a more public statement about this. And now... I guess I have.
I saw the urlLink new film about Stephen Glass last night. I loved the film... which is about the articles that Stephen Glass fabricated for the urlLink New Republic magazine in the mid to late 1990's. He was found out in 1998 and fired by the magazine. Since then, he's written a book that I won't bother linking so as not to taint this website. The urlLink Washington Post columnist Marc Fisher caught up with an appearance by Glass at GWU not too long... and so did Andrew Sullivan, one of Glass's former editors at TNR.
Ah... there's nothing like the satisfaction of watching Michigan kick Ohio State's ass. OSU put up a great fight and even grabbed the momentum a couple times. But the Buckeyes were outmatched and after a season of pulling out wins at the last minute against opponents, the Bucks ran into a defense they couldn't overcome. The final score: 35 to 21. I was on pins and needles for the whole game. But it was a classic matchup... the 100th meeting of two great teams, riveting action, and the best team won. We set another NCAA record for attendance at hallowed Michigan Stadium yesterday... 112,118. It's the first crowd larger than 112,000 in the history of the NCAA. The Bucks fans I ran into around town were courteous; I saw none of the shit you see in games involving other rivals. Not to say it didn't happen, but I didn't see it. The Michigan/Ohio State rivalry runs deep, but, for the most part, it's not a rivalry of trash talk. These are two top notch teams and we all know it. And most of us respect each other. It was a geat football Saturday. Michigan is now #5 in the BCS rankings and goes to the Rose Bowl. There's always the very slight chance that the right combination of upsets could lead us to the Sugar Bowl. But I wouldn't bet on it. I wish more gay guys cared about football. I don't devour Sportscenter or The Sporting News, but I love college football and what I'd love would be a gay sports bar to go watch football. The bar here in Ann Arbor tried opening early on Saturdays for the games a few years ago, but no one ever came, so I guess that's the answer to my question about the popularity of the concept. No mean comments about gay men... I guess most of us just aren't going to come running to watch football.
Reading the stories about Michael Jackson in the papers this morning, I'm amazed at the level of public support that still exists for him... after all that we've learned. In fact, piecing together the information reveals these weird contradictions. His last album, "Invincible," sold two million copies in the US. That's nothing compared to 23 million copies for "Thriller." But consider that Madonna's last album sold only 3 million copies... and anymore, sales in the low millions is rare and notable. Then, of course, there's Jackson's huge following in central and eastern Europe. It, like Mentos, is an unexplained phenomenon. Jackson sells 2 million albums in America with virtually no support from video music channels. So there's a sizable audience that buys without seeing his videos everywhere... as was the case when "Thriller" was released. Sony Music apparently spent 25 million dollars promoting "Invincible." That's a lot of money for 2 million copies sold... although the reports I've seen don't indicate if that was spent in America only or if it's a worldwide expenditure. His music special on CBS in 2001 brought a ratings bonanza for the network. That's not a lurid documentary or an interview... it was a music special associated with an album... much like the current special Jackson is taping for CBS, which the network has cancelled because of the impending charges against Jackson. And then, of course, there are the millions who watched the BBC documentary on Michael Jackson which aired on ABC... and the "response" that Jackson produced, which aired on Fox. So what do we make of all this? Michael Jackson is shunned by the mainstream entertainment industry. The same is the case with the news media, except when there's something scandalous to report. Millions of people are fascinated by Jackson's eccentricities-- the surgeries, his reclusiveness, the scandals involving young boys. But, there are also a few million people who not only buy his albums when they come out... but a smaller number defend Jackson vociferously. Or maybe there are just two of them who always get quoted in the papers. Now that I think of it, they're always 19 year old girls. I guess what surprises me isn't the fascination with the lurid... but his continuing popularity, such as it is... and those 19 year old girls who defend him. There are growing reports of financial troubles. I think it was the New York Times that reported this morning that Jackson had taken out loans totalling $240 million over the past three years. He's not making a lot of money off of album sales. But his catalog of songs and the 250 Beatles songs he owns are valued at $750 million to $1 billion. God, I can't believe I spent this much time writing about Michael Jackson. I need to go clear my head!!
It's about 30 or 35 minutes of black and white footage with no sound, but there's no doubt Andy Warhol's "Blowjob" is a classic. Some critics have called it one of the most important films of the 1960's. No doubt, it's one of the more unusual films from that era. The film is shot on eight reels with a stationary black and white camera. An unidentified man is on screen for the entire length of the film. You see nothing more than his face and his shoulders. He's wearing an open leather jacket. Everything happens off screen. The man seems to unzip his pants and receive a blowjob. But all you see is his face and the range of emotions that he displays over the course of the lengthy blowjob.. until he cums, zips up and has a smoke. The film quickly becomes riveting as you watch his face. His expressions are, well... amazingly expressive. There are moments during the action where he's obviously enjoying the experience; sometimes, he seems bored. Sometimes, he leans back against the white brick wall behind him; his eyes close, then open... staring up into space. He looks at camera, down at what apparently is taking place below, off to the side. What's fascinating is how one is so drawn to the film. I don't know that it's intensely erotic, but it is erotic. Watching it intently, you begin to feel the waves of pleasure that pulse through him, as well as those moments where he's indifferent to the action. The lighting is such that, often, his face falls into shadow when he's looking down or at the camera. You find yourself searching for his eyes that moment. Are they open? Are they closed? Where is he looking? That same sense of yearning swells when the reel of film begins to run out and the screen goes white for several seconds before the next reel picks up the action. You want to hold on to the moment lest you miss what's happening between reels. It's quite extraordinary. And we got to see it in the "How to be Gay" class last night... the class at the University of Michigan that causes an urlLink international controversy every year. Of course, actually, we read long scholarly articles and talk and write about them. And we watch films ranging from "All About Eve" to excerpts from musicals. The controversy is hugely overblown and the assumption that either the university is literally teaching people to be gay-- or that it's showing sexually explicit material-- is completely wrong. But last night's showing of Andy Warhol's "Blowjob" wasn't on the syllabus... to protect the class from protest. And I'm glad because I had read about the film a few years ago and thought I'd never see it. The film is owned by the Museum of Modern Art and last night we got the rare treat of seeing it on the big screen.
9:56am BOSTON (Reuters) - The highest court in Massachusetts ruled on Tuesday that the state cannot deny gays and lesbians the right to marry, a ruling that could make the state the first to recognize gay marriage. In a ruling posted on its Web site, the Supreme Judicial Court said the state of Massachusetts may not "deny the protections, benefits and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry." Gay marriages are forbidden in the United States, although one state, Vermont, allows same-sex civil unions -- contracts that essentially provide most of the legal rights and protections of marriage but under a different name. The Boston Globe reports the ruling stopped short of allowing marriage licenses to be issued to the seven couples who challenged the law. The court ordered the Legislature to come up with a solution within 180 days. Here is the urlLink ruling . Here are portions of the ruling: The question before us is whether, consistent with the Massachusetts Constitution, the Commonwealth may deny the protections, benefits, and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry. We conclude that it may not. The Massachusetts Constitution affirms the dignity and equality of all individuals. It forbids the creation of second-class citizens. In reaching our conclusion we have given full deference to the arguments made by the Commonwealth. But it has failed to identify any constitutionally adequate reason for denying civil marriage to same-sex couples. We are mindful that our decision marks a change in the history of our marriage law. Many people hold deep-seated religious, moral, and ethical convictions that marriage should be limited to the union of one man and one woman, and that homosexual conduct is immoral. Many hold equally strong religious, moral, and ethical convictions that same-sex couples are entitled to be married, and that homosexual persons should be treated no differently than their heterosexual neighbors. Neither view answers the question before us. Our concern is with the Massachusetts Constitution as a charter of governance for every person properly within its reach. "Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code." Lawrence v. Texas, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 2480 (2003) (Lawrence ), quoting Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 850 (1992). (my emphasis) Barred access to the protections, benefits, and obligations of civil marriage, a person who enters into an intimate, exclusive union with another of the same sex is arbitrarily deprived of membership in one of our community's most rewarding and cherished institutions. That exclusion is incompatible with the constitutional principles of respect for individual autonomy and equality under law.

Oh and here's this... an interoffice email that provides a urlLink "Sex in the City" moment: Did anyone wear the wrong pair of brown Merrell Mocs home from our Halloween party? The shoes should be size 9.5. If you look in your closet and find them, or if your feet have felt either a bit uncomfortable or too comfortable, please let me know.
My friend Doug walked into the bar yesterday... dragging a couple of friends behind him. He was all smiles... 20 minutes late for brunch... just like Doug. I was all smiles, too. Doug moved to Denver this summer and I've missed him ever since he left. But he was back in town for a few days and yesterday, we met for brunch and spent some time catching up. I had plenty of news to pass on. He passed on his. And we ate too much food... the universal sign of a good Sunday brunch. Another busy week ahead with a variety of events and class-type stuff. But this promises to be the last week of all of this: the last event is Friday evening and then after that, the calendar is clear. Totally clear. Yes, there will be holiday parties, but the charity events and gatherings and speaking engagements and appearances finish. I'm holding onto a good book to read, for the moment all of this stops. Speaking of the weekend (was I?)... I drove a couple hours on Saturday night to one of those events that you just know is going to be fun. It was a charity event for a small town organization in the western part of Michigan. I go each year to play the role of relatively well-known person and have a good time. The thing about this event that I love... and the reason why I'm even bothering to write about it, is that there are few events where I see a small town's leading citizens kick back and have such a good time. Here at home, I go to events where people have a good time. But the event this past weekend is on another level. The event is at an art gallery. People wander from station to station in the gallery-- each station featuring food, cheese and wines from a particular country. You wear a "passport" around your neck and the goal is to get it stamped at each "country." Which means, the goal is to eat and drink your way through the gallery. And let me emphasize drink . The "countries" open at 6pm and by 7:30pm there are about 150 very happy people wandering around, a little tipsy, a little giggly. What follows is dancing and entertainment... a kind of pandemonium of fun. What I love about it is how laid back the event is, and how much fun people have. They let their hair down and enjoy themselves. It's emblematic of this particular community, which is well-known as an artist's retreat. Nothing like this would ever happen in Ann Arbor. People just won't relax enough. Their loss. I don't know if you saw it last week, but urlLink Charlie Rose had an exceptional interview with former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and documentary filmmaker Errol Morris. Morris conducted about 25 hours of interviews with McNamara and the result is a new film called "The Fog of War." It's to be released next month. I'm a big fan of Charlie Rose most of the time and this interview is one of the best I've seen. McNamara was accused of not speaking up against the Vietnam War, despite his misgivings... even after LBJ fired him. In the last 7 years, he's written a lot about Vietnam, including " urlLink In Retrospect ," and " urlLink Argument Without End ." But he refuses to speak critically about the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq War, despite his apparent misgivings about it. Rose was in rare form, brilliantly questioning McNamara and occasionally bullying him to get him to talk... something interviewers have struggled with for years in interviewing McNamara. What made the show kind of fun was Morris; occasionally, he and Rose talked about McNamara as though he wasn't in the room. McNamara would refuse to answer some question and Morris would interject, "You see why I had to work so hard to get anything out of him?" I have to admit I watched the program once and then watched it again, it was so good. Unfortunately, the show's audio isn't available online... and that sucks. In any case... watch for "The Fog of War"... coming to a big screen near you. And here's an urlLink excellent write-up on the film from "The American Prospect."
My friend Dan and I manage to have different opinions on nearly every movie or TV show we watch. Our tastes are quite different, so every time we see something new, half the fun is talking about it afterward. A few examples: I laughed till I almost cried at "Best in Show." Dan went out for coffee half way through it. He kind of liked "Matrix Revolutions" and I didn't. After we finished "Master and Commander" last night, I liked it a lot overall. He didn't. You really should see "Master and Commander." Russell Crowe is brilliant, perfectly cast. The special effects are stunning, a real knockout. There was only one moment where I thought, this is a not a ship moving on a real ocean, and that thought was a fleeting moment-- probably a 3-second shot of the ship in motion. When the effects are good enough that you can suspend belief and buy into the film that much, it's a sign of a great production. A downside: the writers spent a lot of time trying to build and then resolve a personality conflict between the captain and the ship's doctor. It added about 20 minutes to the fiilm and was entirely unnecessary, in my opinion. Forget the pseudo lover's quarrel and get back to the sailing and fighting. I should mention that Dan and I both liked "Sordid Lives." We also went to see a performance of the Rachmaninov Vespers a couple weeks and we both liked that. So we do agree on a few things. But this isn't a friendship built on broad agreement on the pop culture and high culture we participate in. Personally, I'm still pissed about "Matrix Revolutions." I won't say much more because I'm actually pissed enough that I haven't put into words yet exactly why I feel this way. Call it betrayal, which is too ridiculous a word to use to describe one's feelings about a movie. But remember back to 1998 and "The Matrix." I still feel a thrill and get goosebumps when I think about watching that movie for the first time. Few sequels live up to the promise but rarely have I felt this let down. Those of you who refused to see "Reloaded" and "Revolutions" had the right idea. I needed to know how they were going to resolve things so I had to go. But I regret every minute of it. So now, I'm counting days till "The Return of the King." I've written about it before here, but Tolkien was a favorite of mine in childhood and even as an adult I read it occasionally and enjoy the nostalgic feeling of stepping back into the world of Middle Earth. I've read the books close to a dozen times and like a lover, I look past the imperfections to embrace something special that I can't put into words easily. The first two films have been brilliant beyond expectations. Unlike the Matrix, I don't think Peter Jackson will disappoint with "King."
I have a charity event to attend on Saturday night but otherwise, there's not much on the plan for the weekend. Michigan plays Northwestern, which-- barring a catastrophic attack on San Diego launched by North Korea, or some other unlikely event-- ought to result in an easy victory for Michigan. We're probably favored by 60. But strangely things have happened and Northwestern has launched a surprise or two this season. The bigger issue is that Michigan some offers up a few nasty surprises of its own. "Master and Commander" opens this weekend and I'm likely to go see it tonight. I saw "Matrix Revolutions" last Saturday and I'm still trying to get the bad taste out of my mouth. N for... nookie The urlLink definitive word on the elusive connection between quietly-delivered, politically correct pronouncements... and getting some. (Thanks to urlLink sean t !!)
Sometimes workout injuries bite you in the ass at the moment they occur. Other times, they occur slowly and so they make themselves known only slowly. The later is the case with a painful injury to my forearms. I've apparently torn or damaged the brachioradialis-- the tissue on the forearm near the "crease of the arm" below the bicep. The pain has grown slowly. A couple months ago, it was barely noticeable. But over the past few weeks, as the weight I've lifted has continued to increase, the pain has grown with it. It used to be that I felt the stress only with hammer curls. Today, every bicep exercise was painful... sharp jabs I could feel around the joint at various points. Both arms are affected, but the left is worse. So it's time to end the indifference and ignorance. Beginning tomorrow, a new lighter workout for at least the next two weeks. Using urlLink "Strength Training Anatomy" I'll design daily workouts with exercises that stress that area least. I'll cut the lifting part of the workout from 90 minutes down to 30 min. Weights will get lighter, reps will increase. Cardio will increase. All in all, it could be a good thing for my body to go lighter for a while. And the injury requires it. We'll see how things look in a couple weeks. Oh and more sleep. More sleep. More sleep.
The snaking of the sewer line in the main office area has resulted in an uncoordinated and somewhat involuntary evacuation. I'm staying here at my desk to write for a second... but with this kind of odor, it's likely to be only a second. This must be what it's like at a Kucinich campaign staff meeting-- What's that smell?
The day long strategic planning sessions at work went quite well yesterday. Good fun at times, and productive. The only slip into jargon was my own use of the words "core competency." I was let off lightly. The urlLink red boxes are going down in the Washington DC area. It's too bad. They were kind of cute and looking at them, it was possible to see a future where millions of us would use them to buy everything from milk to tampons. Unfortunately, few Washingtonians bought their tampons there (I know I never once did) and as a result, McDonalds has boarded them up and will take them down. My friend Chris and I always walked by the Adams Morgan kiosk when I visited. Nearly every time, we saw at least one person standing and staring at it. Never once did we actually see someone purchase something from one. Many's the time I'd be up late... hankering for a glass of milk or a tampon... and I'd do nothing about it. What I want is to order groceries online and have someone bring them to my house. Especially since the new Whole Foods Market has opened and all hell has broken loose. Now, Whole Foods has always been overcrowded and too busy to really enjoy here in Ann Arbor. But I thought the new store would change that. It's 50,000 square feet... the fifth largest Whole Foods store in the country. Unfortunately us organically inclined individuals care nothing for the environment; we all drive there and try to find spaces in a lot that's too small for the giant Barnes and Noble and now Whole Foods there. On the weekends, Whole Foods has valet parking. Yes, you read that right. If you don't use that... you're on your own and good luck! Personally, I think it would make more sense to build a crunchy, organo-, enviro-friendly type store in the city so more people can walk or bike to it. But then again, I'm trying to imagine a spot downtown big enough for a 50,000 square foot store. Plus, everyone else will just drive downtown rather than to the suburbs. Six of one, half dozen of the other. I go there to gawk at stuff. I'm like a rube from the hinterlands... staring wide-eyed at shampoos made from real things that actually grew somewhere... apples grown by a real person. There are bottles of pills for every possible malady to afflict the human condition. It's all more expensive, too... so we all feel like we're getting something special. I think I just talked myself into driving over there.
So long, Friendster... it was nice to have known you but you won't be much missed. What else? It's 6:30am; I'm awake after a solid 10 hours of sleep and I'm next door in my favorite coffee place with the lapper to read the news, with no work to do until 9:30am. I usually have to get up very early for work, so a morning like this is a luxury. I attended a men's conference over the weekend. I dreaded it for days because I didn't want to go. I was invited to moderate a panel discussion on "Men's Issues in the 21st Century." I accepted months ago because it seemed far away and I'm still of the (mistaken) impression that you have to accept every offer. So I was miserable Saturday. All I could think about was big men with lots of facial hair sitting around a fire banging on a drum. So primordial. So ridiculous. Plus, there's a small gay activist core inside me that thinks "if heterosexual, white men think they're oppressed... they've got another thing coming." But it wasn't so bad. Yes, there was drumming, something I've never fully understood or appreciated. Yes, there were many big men with facial hair; they had this odd habit of saying "Ho!" to everything they agreed with. Not "Ho, Ho, Ho!" That's the trademark of another big man with facial hair. But they talked about the absence of men of color; and because I brought it up, they briefly addressed the absence of gay men at such events. I left feeling good. Yes, there was a sense of relief but I also kind of had a good time. Those big men with their drums and facial hair aren't so bad. urlLink He and I got dissed recently by an old bitter queen. urlLink He wins though, because the diatribe resulted in two hits to his weblog and none to mine. Bitter queens apparently draw as large an audience as PBS these days. I gave some money to Howard Dean a while back so I got one of those ballots on Thursday, asking for my thoughts on Dean rejecting campaign finance and going it alone. I felt like I was taking the expedient route, casting my vote for doing just that. Not that I personally would have made any difference-- the final tally was 85% for going it alone. I'm uneasy about dumping all this money into it... but I feel that now isn't the time to quibble. Now is the time to run George Bush out of the White House. My reasons for doing this vary from day to day. One of them-- that I'm a Democrat-- doesn't, of course. But quite often, I think less of some kind of long-term damage he might be doing and concentrate on this: "you cocky bastard... you and your know-it-all cronies are going down." How's that for articulate and principled? No, it's not the "hate Bush" stuff that everyone was talking about in August and September. It's more the "you're too big for your britches" variant.
The funny part is... this unveiling in the Senate gallery is not of urlLink a bust of Dan Quayle, it's Dan Quayle himself . Careful observers will note other important works in the background: the bust of Jefferson Davis wearing a woman's bonnet; and the new bust of a piece of uncarved stone... The Unknown Senator.
I've been in a foul mood the past couple of days. It's the presidential election. It's a year from now, folks, and the incumbent faces a "challenge" from 9 dwarfs. Or maybe it's 5 dwarfs and 4 somewhat larger, but still ugly, trolls. It's all so inelegant and well maybe that's the way it always is. No one would look back nostalgically on Bush I/Dukakis, for instance, and call that an edifying exchange of ideas. Neither is this. But maybe it's all the more frustrating because of the potential victory that George W. Bush is handing to Democrats on a platter. I think this race is still the Democrats' to lose... and lose it they will if they don't get their act together. Dean's so-called gaffe about guys in pickup trucks with confederate flags is a good example of the predicament we're in. Last night's debate was a big pile-on... each pathetic creature trying to outdo the other in expressing outrage and demanding apologies. I have two thoughts on this. First of all, I agree with the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which almost never happens. But the Monday edition said this, paraphrased: Credit Howard Dean for running a shrewd campaign, but one reason he's leading the Democratic Presidential sweepstakes is because his opponents don't seem to understand his appeal. Look no further than this weekend's flap over Dr. Dean's alleged embrace of the Confederate flag. Democrats usually smear Republicans with this kind of race-baiting politics, but it isn't any more justified when Democrats use it against one of their own. Dr. Dean is hardly sympathetic to the Confederacy, or Jim Crow, or apartheid or any other kind of racial discrimination. He was merely saying he'd like to win the support of Southerners who over the years have fled the Democratic Party represented by the Kerrys and the Dick Gephardts. One reason those and so many other voters have left is precisely because of the kind of litmus-test, interest-group gotcha! politics that this racial pandering represents. Yet Dr. Dean's opponents continue to attack him for violating liberal taboos on guns, Medicare, trade and now civil rights. No wonder Democratic voters find him refreshing. Now, the Journal is using this stance to further its own anti-Democratic slant. But that doesn't take away from the validity of the basic argument. Screaming racism is low politics and a sign that Democrats still don't know who the real enemy is. Or maybe they do know it's Bush, but there are so many of them that they can do little more than try to bring each other down. Once again, maybe its time to say goodbye to some vanity candidates. Goodbye Carol Moseley Braun. Goodbye, Dennis Kucinich. Goodbye, John Edwards. Goodbye, All Sharpton. That's enough for now, but we'll all want a couple more goodbyes in the next few months. The sooner the better. Oh and my second thought. Yes, credit Howard Dean for having his heart in the right place... trying to reach out to former Democratic voters in the South. But take some points away from him once again for putting his foot in his mouth. This kind of "oops, did I say it that way?" was cute and endearing last year when campaign rallies consisted of take-out in a VW Bug. But now, it's long past time for Dean to stick to message... in speeches and interviews. Give message a big bear hug and don't be so smug as to think that you can make it up as you go.
The end of anything brings about a certain amount of reflection. Rarely does it bring unalloyed satisfaction. I suppose the best we can hope for is a sense of improvement, development-- perhaps even the pleasure of having actually achieved a few of the resolutions made one year ago. The year I'm concluding has been one of big changes-- some of which I initiated, some of which were visited upon me by outside forces. Three changes float to the surface in the sea. This year, I walked away from the most significant part of my career so far, the one thing that people thought made me "famous." Fame is so relative and my "fame" was more relative than most. But while I enjoyed what I did, I also decided that 2003 was the time to move on. I think many people are still trying to figure this out. I could put it this way, I suppose: I came, I saw, I conquered. But if I'm going to be that brazen, I'd have to add, I got tired, I reconsidered, I ended. Speaking of endings, I ended a long, rambling, fractured and extremely destructive relationship two days before 2003 began. At first, that seemed enough. But five months into the year, I decided that I was still dragging the chains, kind of like Marley's ghost. So I ended the friendship, too, only the second time I've ever ended a dating relationship and broke off all ties. Even now, a few months out, it remains one of the 10 Great Liberating Moments of My Life, if there is such a list. On a June afternoon, as I shifted dumbbells and began concentrating on the next set, a guy walked up to me to say hi. He was a familiar face. I'd seen him at the gym for 2 years, had spoken 2 words with him. The introduction turned to conversation, then to a date and then another. And here we are, the two of us, at the six month mark. Those are big changes... two endings and one beginning. The responses from friends and readers to these and other changes have been fascinating, ranging from understanding and encouraging to an inexplicable bitterness. I remember one reader of this weblog writing what I'm sure he thought was a grand indictment of my career and my life-- at the time I broke up and announced the end of my work. Mind you, someone with virtually no clue about my life beyond this weblog. The gist of his argument was this: I had achieved a lot, a great relationship, a great job, fame, etc. But when I "arrived" I threw it away because it wasn't good enough for me. I could never be satisfied but would always discard each success in the pursuit of something better. This was probably the harshest expression of a sentiment that I've come to believe many people shared about my life and those endings, including some of my friends. They tried to understand and they weren't bitchy about it, but they were asking essentially the same question implicit in that reader's email: why are you turning away from success? And the other, darker question: do you think so much of yourself that you can do better than what you've already achieved? The answer to that question is simple: Yes. But if you think of any human achievement, it's the result of someone deciding, in his or her hubris, that something greater was possible. For every million failures, there have been a billion successes. So what of it? We call it civilization. That's not the issue. Here's the issue: the implicit idea that at some point one should stop and "be happy" with whatever success he has achieved to that point. There may be others to come but the pursuit is mainly over. In gay culture, our obsession with youth adds extra weight to this view. The message to me should be you're 36 years old. You're getting older. It's time to get into a relationship. Time to settle into a good job. Time to concentrate on a house, a dog, a boyfriend, dinner parties. Time to understand that you are part of the past. Time to bring those great quests to a successful end. Bullshit. First of all, what many people experience in that state isn't really happiness or even the compromise of happiness and unfulfillment that is the reality of the human condition. And the people who say "why can't you just be happy with what you have" are often precisely the people who are the most unhappy and bitter with their lot. I will not be naive enough to believe that I don't have to make the compromise between happiness and unfulfillment that all must make. But I will not give up and "be happy" simply because others have already done so, or the more bitter members of my gay culture think I should do so. At 36, I've explored a lot of life. But I'm nowhere near done. There's too much opportunity ahead and I believe and hope that I have years and decades ahead in which to do it. Some things may settle in a little more. Heck, I've lived in the same city for more than 6 years-- unprecedented! I may stay for a long time, but if I do it will be opportunity that causes me to stay, not inertia. I may go. I may find another job. I may find another boyfriend. I may make dozens more changes in my life before I reach the time and age where I decide that it's possible to make the deeper compromise with happiness and achievement. At this point in my life, I'm not ready to focus on endings. Endings are a tiny portion of the experience of life, which, in its essence, is becoming . I will become; I will improve; I will aspire. And while I'll make more pedestrian resolutions tomorrow, this is my core resolve. And this is the source of my immense satisfaction, happiness and joy at the privilege of waking up every morning.
A reader writes: it warms the cockles of my heart that you want to adopt a female dog! here i thought you were a totally obnoxious mysogonist, what with your talk of '...other than the woman behind me who struggled for several minutes to open a simple bag of candy (Die, Bitch. Die.)' i thought about writing to suggest that you could make your point very graciously by asking the dumb bitch if you could help her. That would be the mature thing to do, I think, rather than fuming w/your rather adolescent vitriol. For every 10 people who get it... there will always be one who doesn't.
I'm moving closer and closer to getting a puppy. The thought has occupied a distant corner of my mind for the past 2-3 years. Like an advancing glacier, it's inched forward relentlessly. Objects that move closer grow more imposing. This puppy isn't a towering desire yet, but give it a little more time. The local shelter had a six-month old female Rottweiler mix last week. She was smaller than usual, quite docile and reserved for a puppy. Absolutely adorable. But she's been adopted and her picture no longer graces the humane society's website. She was the first puppy I'd seen in a long time that struck me as one of those dogs I might be able to adopt immediately, no questions asked, love at first sight, wedding bells ringing, love is in the air. But had I given it enough thought? Am I around enough to be a part of the pup's life? Will I train it well? What will the landlords think? What about the boyfriend? What if she doesn't get along with my friends' dogs? Perhaps unnecessary overconcern, but from a guy who used to regularly kill every plant he received; and whose childhood experience with a goldfish was fatal (for the fish), this is a valid concern. On the other hand, I've developed a green thumb. I've learned not to accept goldfish as pets. Maybe I'm ready. But first there will be more thought, from the king of hyperanalysis. The puppy (it will be a puppy) will be a yellow lab or a rottweiler. It will probably be female. And there, certainty ends. Enough time for a dog? Rubber squeezetoys are cheap gifts. hmmm... I need to think about this.
I've been getting some ribbing from urlLink unidentified readers who think I'm talking too much about other stuff and not enough about personal things. This is true. I resolve to mend my ways in 04. BUT... I can't resist drawing your attention to this story in urlLink today's Washington Post . The FBI warns that terrorists might have gained a valuable new tool in their efforts to wreak havoc our homeland: almanacs . Yes, friends, and also Canadians who are concerned about security, the World Almanac and Book of Facts has been shown to contain actual facts, about bridges, roads, buildings. The FBI Intelligence (?) Bulletin says "terrorist operatives may rely on almanacs to assist with target selection and pre-operational planning." And indeed, the almanacs have made terrorism available to the masses. " The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2000 will tell you what you need to know in a minute or less, thanks to the comprehensive contents list and thumb index" crows the World Almanac website. "Business, astronomy, science, politics, geography, and sports are all thoroughly covered, as well as highlights from 1999 and a special millennium section including top 10 lists from the past 1,000 years." Readers of the almanacs who are considering terrorism will have at their disposal "pages of data on everything from classic films to silver production... good for term papers and bar bets. Browse through the book and you're sure to find yourself stopping, reading, and learning. For instance, what is the order of succession to the presidency?" Agents of terror may be able to discover the hidden purpose of Dick Cheney. As if that's not enough, the 2000 World Almanac also contains "a thought-provoking lead essay from Robert Reich on the struggle between technology and tribalism." Readers, I give you terror. This warning is somewhat problematic. Most Americans own an almanac, but 90% of them date from 1981. Chances are, your almanac-toting terrorist is, right now, on a mission to destroy the World Trade Center, or assassinate former President Nixon. And no terrorist is dumb enough to consult the Farmer's Almanac to predict the weather. The FBI is not deterred. Based on this premise, expect the government to ban phone books, newspapers, and the Discovery Channel's urlLink Exteme Engineering series.
I went to see "Return of the King" tonight. I saw it at the first midnight showing, but I wanted to see it again. Other than the woman behind me who struggled for several minutes to open a simple bag of candy (Die, Bitch. Die.) it was a good experience. I had a chance to reconsider the film away from the frenzy of opening night and a few thousand die-hard LOTR fans in the theater with me. I still think "Return of the King" is a great movie. Already knowing what was going to be included and what was left out made it easier to watch the second time around. There are few things that I miss from the book, it's more how Peter Jackson decided to bring certain moments to the screen. For instance, I've heard others carp about it and I agree: giving away that it was Eowyn suited up as a man the moment she scoops up Merry was a mistake. Following the book slavishly here would have made it necessary to extend the story. But Jackson could have just allowed viewers to discover that fact the moment she pulled off her helmet to face the Witch King of Angmar. I think it would have been a great reveal. When the dialogue has to deviate from the general contours of the book, lines become trite. "You can't leave me." "You don't mean that." It's like a Hollywood movie scene has been dropped in the middle of a Shakespeare play. I'm not saying that Tolkien is Shakespeare; you know what I mean. The scene where Frodo awakens in the Houses of Healing near the end is strangely humorous. He sees Gandalf for the first time since Moria; the two share looks of joy and surprise and Gandalf starts to laugh. Then Frodo starts to laugh. They laugh and laugh. And then the door opens, and in bound Merry and Pippin. They jump on the bed and wrestle around with Frodo and everybody laughs. Then in walks Gimli, who throws his arms open wide... and at that moment you think is Gimli going to cavort on the bed, too? The audience of diehards at the midnight screening started tittering at the sight of Gimli. When Legolas appeared in the doorway, the Rings diehards burst into laughter. For a movie in which there's been more weightiness than one can possibly imagine, this is a supremely absurd moment. And it doesn't really get any better. This reunion of the company, which was so special and joyful and emotional in the book becomes this goofy scene with Gandalf, Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas laughing and looking on as three Hobbits engage in hearty horseplay. The only thing that saves it is the long look shared by Sam and Frodo. The relationship between Sam and Frodo is just about as good as Hollywood could get it, I think. Over the course of three films, the concept of their love for each other and their inseparability grows and grows. The final scene where Frodo says goodbye to Sam is slow as it should be. Frodo kisses Sam's brow and the look the two share is long and meaningful. I think the lighting of the Beacons of Gondor is a great piece of cinematography. The rendition of Gondor is far more brilliant than I ever imagined it in the dozen times I read the books growing up. And I must say I don't really miss the complete jettisoning from the film of Saruman and all his mischief back in the Shire. The Scouring of the Shire contained the lesson that victory can't come without loss. But that lesson is abundant in Tolkien, including in the character of Frodo, whose hurts are such that he joins the elves leaving Middle Earth at the end of the Third Age. I liked the subtle presentation of Elrond, Galadriel and Gandalf as the bearers of the Three Rings. I miss one line from Gandalf. In the book, the moment the Ring is about to go into the fire, the Nazgul wheel around and fly like the wind toward Mount Doom. And in the midst of the fighting, Gandalf says, "Stand, Men of the West! Stand and Wait! For this is the hour of doom." It's a moment of great drama and I wish Jackson had included it. But I'm willing to forgive since his staging of the battle at the Black Gate was brilliant; Aragorn turning toward the gate and running with his sword drawn... the pause and then the two hobbits setting off before everyone else. That's nicely done.
I'm still trying to crystallize my thinking about Howard Dean. Thank goodness I don't live in Iowa because I don't think I'd arrive at a final decision by the caucuses. I live in Michigan, which gives me a few extra weeks, but the clock is ticking and I still don't know what to do about Dean. In summary, I'm nominally supporting Dean because I like some of his policies, I like some of his record and I like some of his feistiness. I like Clark, too, but even better, I like someone who can beat Bush. I'm not sure Clark can; but Dean... uh oh, better hold off on that for now. So anyway, basically, I'm for Dean. But I'm concerned because I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place in supporting Dean. Specifically, his ass-stupid remarks are annoying the hell out of me. And my main reason for supporting him-- his ability to beat Bush-- is questionable. I've written here before that much of the criticism of Dean can be dismissed; it's mean-spirited, orchestrated by the other candidates, flimsy, etc. It's a campaign, remember? Much of the hand-wringing over whether he's too extreme or whether he's electable is coming from the Democratic Leadership Council and the party leadership... broadcast with the hope that it will bring down Dean. I've also written that Dean has a way of saying the most inappropriate thing at the most inappropriate time. That he regularly commits gaffes. That he regularly expresses views that might be barely acceptable if they were more eloquently presented, but are unacceptable as they escape his mouth. That he thinks he's a very smart man (and he is almost as smart as he thinks he is). So, as the primary/caucus season approaches, here I am thinking about Dean yet again and wondering if I can support him. There is a fight for the soul of the Democratic Party. In the last 10 years, the DLC has nudged the party closer to the ideological center; the result was 2 successful Presidential elections. I see the 2000 loss as less an indictment of the DLC than Al Gore's campaign strategies. But what am I to think of the Democratic congressional leadership the past two years? Democratic leadership has been an oxymoron in Congress. I do blame ideology for that. So, Dean's regular attacks on the "Republican wing" of the Democratic party resonate. He's probably right. But if he is, which way is Dean pulling the party? Well, it's something of a more progressive, combative, activist future. But some of it, like the anti-trade rhetoric, reeks of the rotting Democratic party of the past... the party of Mondale and Dukakis. Is that the direction I want my party to take? Can I support a candidate who leads it in that direction? Can I live with it if it means we win? And now, what if we don't win? I believe Dean is probably the most capable of the Democratic candidates when it comes to beating President Bush. But I do not think he will beat Bush unless Dean gets much better or Bush gets much worse. The polls, and I know it's early, show this. The Dean campaign seems to be growing more aware of the Doctor's weaknesses-- foreign policy naivete, for instance. Lately, they've been stressing that he'll have good advisors. And Dean himself has talked about finding a Vice President with strong foreign policy experience. Do I give my vote to Dean because he's the front-runner now? Do I vote for him because he seems most likely to beat President Bush? Is that the most important goal? Do I vote for him despite policies I can't agree with? I realize much of this is a jumble, but in writing this out, I'm trying to puzzle my way to a conclusion. I have principled friends who support Dean, some despite personal misgivings about various policies or Dean's demeanor. I have some principled friends who drank the kool-aid a long time ago and cannot hold an intelligent conversation considering all sides of the Dean issue anymore. The disciples are doing most of the talking right now. I'm waiting to hear more from the others.
I've been asleep for at least 15 hours, the culmination of too many late nights this week, a lingering cold, my own poor sleep habits. I get out of bed and my back is killing me. Fucking mattress. I hobble around to the end of the bed and there, in a pile on the floor, are the clothes I wore yesterday. There are clean folded shirts on the shelves, pairs of jeans, cleaned and pressed in the closet. But the shelves and the closet are several steps away and at my feet are yesterday's castoffs. The choice is clear. My new AF long underwear shirt slips over my head, followed by my sweatshirt. Yesterday's jeans, and until I take a shower after reading the paper, yesterday's socks. I like clean things. I wear them all the time for work. Pants. Shirt. Tie. Belt. Shoes. Clean clothes smell like laundry soap. They're cold and stiff, laying on the shelf with their creases so perfect. Yesterday's clothes are slightly rumpled. But they're worn in. They don't smell like laundry detergent or fabric softener. To me, they don't have any smell at all, which means, of course, they smell like me. As the shirt goes over my head, I smell yesterday's cologne as it descends. In a few hours, I'll have a shower. And then, I'll reach for the clean shirt, new jeans, socks, followed by a spray of some cologne. But for now, I hug myself in my old shirt and sweatshirt, my muscles enveloped in warmth and familiarity. It's... Saturday.
Wednesday night was an orgy of caloric consumption. We were at Chris's parents' place in Toledo for Christmas Eve and what is, for me, the highlight of the season. There was more than enough of everything, including the most important food groups-- fat, sweet and salt. There was Italian wedding soup, gnocchi with sauce, veal cutlets, salad, snap peas and an apple cake that is sure to have caused a short-term drop in worldwide cream cheese supplies. That doesn't count the cookies, bars, candy, wine and mixed drinks. All of us there are careful about what we eat, but we all made a special allowance for the day. I made another special allowance by not eating yesterday, except for the bf's family gathering, where I consumed a small and prudent sampling of the turkey and fixin's. I think I could probably not eat today and I'd be fine, too. Or I could eat and make up for it by doing cardio for um... 7 hours. Today, I'll go back to Toledo to hang out for a while. I'll read, I'll nap, I'll shop. Geez, life is good. Can you tell I'm on vacation?
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!! Have a great day!
A reminder of the urlLink dangers journalists face every day-- particularly during the obligatory reindeer story season.
Matt and I blocked out 4 hours last night for last minute shopping. Or, in my case, shopping... since I started and finished yesterday. This is the first year in a long time that I haven't bought everything on-line ahead of time. I was too busy (lazy) . We began the 4 hour shopping experience the way that Matt and I like to do it... immediately apportioning a quarter of the time for eating and gossip. I consumed a 20 inch grinder (Michigan for sub sandwich, basically). The secret is a highly-controlled gag reflex. Then we went to the mall. Not many people there, at least not what you'd expect for 12/23. No lines, no waiting! Matt and I have developed a particular way of shopping. We multi-task, browsing for gifts while we browse the hotter gay boys. We also carry on a long conversation, generally about sex, just beneath the hearing threshhold of passersby. We played Spot The Homo on the way to Abercrombie and Fitch, where we dutifully bought presents for others and then indulged ourselves. I bought a couple of long underwear type shirts that make my muscles bulge in important spots, and A's new "Fierce" cologne. I'm in a giving spirit... I give to myself. Harry and David's... and fruit baskets. How fitting. We looked over the fruitcake, my favorite! But since one serving has half the fat that one normal human should consume in a day , we moved on. I'm such a prude. I even talked Matt out of chocolate truffles. Saw a guy from the gym. He had his girlfriend with him, but we knew better. To the bath and body store and Williams and Sonoma. Did I mention we're gay? And on to Marshall Field's, where Matt bought an expensive toaster for his mom. The toaster cost $50, but it's brushed aluminum and has more dials and buttons than one can imagine. I swear there was an ethernet port on the side. Have you noticed that friends and loved ones of gay men have the nicest skin and Calphalon cookware? Out the door at 9pm. How's that? The only disappointment was that A wasn't featuring the live models wearing underwear in the store that they had earlier in the season. A friend of mine from the bar works at the store next door and I don't think he's done any work for the last 3 weekends. Unless sexual assault counts as work. Back home to put on my new shirts and flex in the mirror (I'm such a dork). And into the bed and under the covers... my eyes closing slowly just as Christmas Eve begins.
From the urlLink Triangle Foundation : Michigan has become the tenth state to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation in state employment. Governor Granholm issued the executive directive today. It covers 55,000 state employees in the Executive Branch of State Government, representing 95% of all state employees. "Governor Granholm has proudly signed this executive directive and noted that the employment practices of state government should promote public confidence in the fairness and integrity of government and should reflect a commitment to equal employment opportunities," said Liz Boyd, press secretary for Governor Granholm. "Governor Granholm is grateful to all the community organizations that provide input on this executive directive." Happy Holidays, Governor!
where terrorism is an ever present threat, there's nothing like a cup of hot cocoa to make one feel as though at least their little corner of the world is ordered and tranquil. Unless the coffee you use to prepare said cocoa is pure shit. The coffee we're supplied with at work is named for the company I work for. That's Red Flag #1. It's a "special blend" that comes to us in large bags that we put in the freezer. In the morning, I ladle out 8 scoops for our "Ultra-Maker" and after exactly 7 minutes, it produces a beverage that looks exactly like coffee but tastes like the trough at Blow Buddies on Wet Wednesday. I try to focus on the positive and put two packets of Swiss Miss in the cup. That cuts the noxious acidic taste and if you don't think that this might be what piss tastes like with 2 packets of Swiss Miss, you're fine. As a liberal, open-minded kind of person, I feel the need to state if you do make your cocoa with urine, it's alright. By now, it's become apparent that-- once again-- I have nothing to do at work and here I sit working up a post about making a tasty beverage with pee. I'm finally excited about Christmas. My good friend Chris is coming home from DC for a few days. I'll do Christmas Eve with Chris's family, eating a stunning quantity of Italian food, and drinking good wine and enjoying each other's company. Chris's parents are very important to me. They're kind of the parents I never had. And since my parents are still aghast at the thought of their son, The Sodomite, spending Christmas with them, I go to Chris's parents' place and there I'm treated like family. Christmas Day we'll be at friends. I'm even going to get some presents!
Friday afternoon, I spent about half an hour on the phone with Chris Paul, the author and creator of urlLink Chrisonomicon . After about three and a half years of posting on the site, Chris decided to move on. He has a few reasons for doing so, but they seem to boil down to this: the weblog was a vital part of his life at one stage. But as his life has changed, he seems to feel he's outgrown it. For a while, he tried to continue with it. But as he wrote in his final post, he felt what he was writing had lost some of its lustre. In the interview, he also talks about the sheer effort of separating oneself from the events of one's life, in order to establish a perspective for writing about them. A couple readers wrote me last week to say that they sensed Chrisonomicon was near the end. Chris's posts were shorter and less frequent. They had become less personal. As Chris explained in his last post, he was trying different approaches to the weblog. But I think real life was also intruding. Chrisonomicon readers know he's in a serious relationship now. He and Mike own a house. They have a new, larger web of friends-- in real life. In that scenario, the virtual world of blogs fades. This isn't always the case, but having written my own weblog as a single guy and as someone dating, I know that being in a relationship tends to result in a natural downgrading of the weblog. Besides, when we're single, there seems to be more to write about-- dates, hookups, angst over the last relationship, whatever. A stable, happy relationship probably doesn't produce as much material for writing. And so, Chrisonomicon passes. I think Chris's writing was some of the best you could find in the blogosphere. His words were always right. His feelings so often translated fluidly to the page. He will be missed.

I'm happy to report that Christmas shopping will begin tomorrow. Yes, definitely. Yes, tomorrow, I will go shopping for Christmas.
I made a series of decisions today that-- taken together-- made me feel better about the world than I have for some time. I usually don't watch TV news on Sunday, or any other day for that matter. But this afternoon while doing laundry and generally messing around at home, having run out of things to watch on TiVo, I clicked over to CNN International to watch the news. I have DirecTV, where you can easily find CNNI on channel 300-something, near that one channel that always seems to be selling faux-diamond rings. Nevertheless, I found it and discovered-- as I always do when I watch it-- that there's a world outside the United States. That there are stories that occur elsewhere besides the US and its 51st state, Iraq. (Actually, probably a quarter of CNN viewers think the 51st state is Canada.) If you've ever watched CNN International and compared it to domestic CNN, the differences are stark. After I watched a half hour of what seemed to be real, quality news, I found an hour of last week's CBC coverage of the capture of Saddam Hussein on the TiVo. What followed was another hour of careful reporting and thoughtful commentary. It's amazing how the way news is reported can make one feel things aren't so bad. No screaming pundits, multi-layered news crawls, specially-composed "Saddam Captured" music and graphics, 72 point headlines. Even after hearing about elevated threat levels and Philippine mudslides, I wasn't addled beyond words. hmmm... is that a good thing? Which brings me to The Whip ... the spin around the blogosphere-- the title courtesy of urlLink Aaron Brown , the world's most annoying news anchor. Sam, whom I enjoy reading more and more, urlLink confesses the holiday season is pushing him to the brink of murder. In the post immediately preceding that, you can find his urlLink Review of Popular Music . That alone should show you why I like this guy. Evanescence gets "The My Wellbutrin Don't Werk, Where's a God Damned Razor Blade When I Need One... Award." Yes, he's funny; he's smart. Read him; Link him; Love him. Sleep with me, Sam... NOW. I meant to bring this up the other day, but urlLink Tin Man has been marking the final ten days before he turns 30 with a series of short pieces looking at the ten most memorable events of his twenties. Good writing draws you into the experience of the writer and these stories will do just that. The urlLink 3 Squirrels , whoever and wherever they are, engage in some good boyfriend gossip and advice sharing. They don't post a lot, but often one of them will say something that makes me go hmmmm. Handsome and cool Jimbo, more handsome in real life, visits Cobalt with equally handsome and erudite blog pal urlLink Chrisafer . While there, Jimbo applies his considerable urlLink avian knowledge to those milling about. Last time I was there in July, I was felt up by Bottle-Bleached Tragedy. I recognized him by his claw as it violated my person while he whisked by to the restroom. By the way... being concerned with quality news reporting as I am, I'm on the lookout for funny Photoshopped pictures of the Great (Unwashed and Captured) Iraqi Leader. If you see any... let me know!
The recording industry's careful plan to recoup its filesharing losses by suing 12 year olds has been dealt a severe blow by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The court has urlLink ruled that the RIAA can't require ISP's to identify subscribers who are sharing music files. It said the RIAA's claim that ISP's were liable for the shared files that traverse their networks "borders upon the silly." The court says the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes no mention of file-sharing anywhere in the law. In 1998, few were thinking about that. As long as it's not in the law, you can't use it as the basis for your suits. The Court ruled that Congress could expand the DMCA to include file-sharing if it sees fit. But even with considerable pressure from the RIAA, this is unlikely... given how unpopular the RIAA's actions have been. File-sharing is copyright infringement, too be sure. But in its haste the squash the movement, while making no attempts to come up with a feasible alternative, we should add, the RIAA lost a good number of the few friends it had. Unfortunately, this promises only to further heat up the rhetoric. The RIAA is more bellicose than ever, promising more lawsuits. But the fact is, this ruling strikes at the heart of the current plan.
from an article in a public broadcasting trade publication: [individual] is returning to PBS after working for several years at the Discovery Channel. There, she learned that a network succeeds by focusing on what its audience wants and preparing programs that fit. She was unable to learn this at PBS, obviously.
I can't resist cookies with impossibly bright frosting and I'm not sure why. Given this weakness, I think you can understand how dangerous the holiday season is for me. So far, I've been successful in holding back from a feeding frenzy. But I had a sugar cookie this morning at work, featuring a kind of pinkish, red frosting that tasted like cherries. Cherries and a range of clear chemicals stored in vials at a plant in New Jersey. Terry Gross talked to Matt Groening yesterday on urlLink Fresh Air . She hasn't interviewed him since the Simpson's first hit the air with their own series, way back in the mists of time. Not that you'd know this because that early interview has run approximately 1,259 times. But yesterday was a new interview and most of the work in the office ground to a halt for the hour as we listened and laughed at Groening's musings on his characters. urlLink Click here to listen for yourself. I missed the USA Today urlLink piece on gay tourism . It's about how cities are working hard to market themselves to gays and lesbians. Apparently, the Supreme Court's sodomy ruling has encouraged many cities to reach out more openly to LGBT tourists. Religious conservative groups step up to the plate with the usual bag of stupid comments. NPR's piece on the end of life begins today with Bob Edwards saying: "Thousands of Americans are in a persistent vegetative state." No additional comment needed.
This information is circulating around the internet... but if you haven't seen it yet... the urlLink click now and vote in the American Family Association's urlLink poll on gay marriage . They're no friends of ours but they plan to present the results of their poll to members of Congress... presumably to show the overwhelming opposition to gay marriage in America. Feel free to vote and help present a more clear picture of American sentiment. And feel free to pass this website on!
There's growing criticism of Howard Dean and I think there should be. The candidate, whom I nominally support, has a penchant for shooting off his mouth. The more he does it, the more it leaves him open to charges of inaccuracy and outright lying. And that's no help to his campaign. Some of the criticism is crap. A couple days ago, Dean said America probably wasn't safer after the capture of Saddam Hussein. He's probably right. Saddam was never the central figure in the global financing or conduct of terrorism, despite the Bush administration's attempt to turn him into the pivotal figure in the war on terror. Comments from Kerry and others calling Dean's credibility as a leader into question for this view are pure politics and should be treated as such. But it's harder to dismiss the growing number of gaffes and unnecessarily inflammatory statements. urlLink A story in the Washington Post this morning catalogs a few of them. He mispeaks: "I never said Saddam was a danger to the United States. Ever." But there's the transcript from CBS in September 2002: "There is no question that Saddam Hussein is a threat to the United States. The question is: Is he an immediate threat?" All candidates do this. "I said X"; "I never said Y"; I always say Z." Any public figure with a long career will have a long list of contradictions trailing behind him. Heck, I've had 8 opinions about the Iraq War. If I ran for public office, I'd spend a lot of time just trying to dig myself out. But here's a different kind of statement, from The Diane Rehm Show on 12/1: "The most interesting theory that I've heard so far -- which is nothing more than a theory, it can't be proved -- is that he was warned ahead of time by the Saudis," Dean replied. "Now who knows what the real situation is? But the trouble is by suppressing that kind of information, you lead to those kinds of theories, whether they have any truth to them or not, and they get repeated as fact." Since he made this statement, Dean has given up to three different responses for why he said it-- often within the space of a couple minutes. First, I said it because people believe it . Second, I don't believe it . And third, it would be nice to know . Those three statements don't mesh. You can see the same problematic reasoning in his statement on the Rehm show. This is flimsy thinking. Politically, it's a stupid thing to say. Stupid. Highly disingenuous. What bothers me about Dean is how often this happens. And how little his supporters seem to care. I understand that a lot of voters all hot 'n heavy for Dean will overlook this trait. They say it's the darker flipside of a trait that they love: he's a straight talker who doesn't mince words. That would be barely excusable if Dean was a straight-talker. But when you look inside his rhetoric and consider it over time, his views have been all over the map. And Dean hasn't been above pandering. His anger over President Bush's decision to end steel tariffs is close to an all-time low for the Dean campaign. It was almost as bad as the Bush administration's decision to levy the tariffs in the first place. Dean accused the President of not caring about steelworkers when he lifted the tariffs. That's crap, pure and simple. The tariffs were a political maneuver on the part of the Bush administration to get votes in swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. They were set to expire in March 2005, conveniently after the election. The tariffs were clearly illegal and even a protectionist like Dean who talks about working with the international community ought to be able to understand a WTO ruling against unfair trade practices. In another time and place, this kind of base pandering and demagogery would cause me to find another candidate. But what do you do when the front-runner is the culprit? Wesley Clark is smart, a little brash, courageous, the Clinton choice for President... and highly invisible-- especially for a candidate who is also considered a viable contender. I would likely support Clark in a minute, if he could break through. But he seems unable to, even though he's been given a big advantage at the start. I used to tell people that Dean was kind of a loudmouth but as the campaign heated up, his staff would reign him in and he would make fewer mistakes. After his poorly expressed views about southern voters, I thought he would learn a lesson. It's clear he hasn't. He continues to act as though he's smarter than everyone else... even though his actions continually prove him wrong. Being careful about what you say doesn't make you a pansy or less of a fighter. The potential leader of the free world must understand that every word he (in this case, he) utters carries a tremendous weight and power. The political motivation for the charges aside, Dean's opponents are right. He's not acting like a president.
Slept away much of the day... the result of the overnight viewing of "Return of the King." Having seen the 3 films separately, I've been thinking about the prospect of seeing them together in one sitting. A few theaters did this but I don't think there are many that will be offering that kind of a showing beyond today. A marathon viewing would bring the experience together for me. Watching the DVD's at home is nice but it's not quite the same. Still, I might screen both of them at home before making my second trip to the theater for "King." Yes, there will be a second viewing. Not anymore than that, but I figure a good film is worth seeing a second time. I'm also excited about the new Errol Morris documentary urlLink "Fog of War" which opens on Friday. It's probably not on the same level as "King" (do ya think?) but I can't get enough of Robert McNamara trying to justify himself.
from urlLink today's New York Times review ... [Peter Jackson's] "King" is a meticulous and prodigious vision made by a director who was not hamstrung by heavy use of computer special-effects imagery. Over at the urlLink Post , Stephen Hunter writes that the one thing Jackson does brilliantly is capture the exhilaration, fatigue, heroism and despair of war. He looks at it as something not ennobling but exhausting, more ordeal than crusade but -- completely necessary. There are better excerpts pointing to the brilliance of the film but they reveal details about the movie that I won't reveal here. (I'm not talking about the plot of the story itself, of course. I mean how the movie unfolds the well-known story.) If you want those extra details, read the full reviews.
... from the midnight screening, I have to say that the final film in the Lord of the Rings is amazing. I haven't seen the likes of this movie for a long time. Beautiful work...
Today is the 7th anniversary of my website. And just because I can't resist torturing you... my first ever recorded weblog post, 11/19/1997: Well... what is going on today? Not too much... just hanging out. :) If you've ever talked to me on IRC, ISCA, or AOL you've heard me use those phrases often. Was in the mood to shop last night... so Sean and I went to the mall and I picked up a couple of shirts at Abercrombie Fitch. Since I've moved, I've essentially dropped my old wardrobe and adopted a new look. It sort of fits with my updated physique-- don't get me wrong, that's definitely a developing thing. There's still a long way for me to go. And friends like Sean and Keith are vital when it comes to picking out good stuff! Anyway... I can definitely use more shirts as a part of the changeover, so I'm picking up 2 or 3 a month from A, Eddie Bauer and J Crew until I get some variety. The hit counter showed the first six readers died of boredom.
urlLink I'm Ready!!!! A group of five of us will be going to see "Return of the King" tonight at 12:01am. I read the books at least a dozen times when I was young. With any book that we love as a child, there's a glow that surrounds it and our memories of it are filled with nostalgia... memories of late nights curled up in bed with a good book, turning page after page, not wanting to sleep for fear the story might go on without you. So as an adult, I overlook the weaknesses of LOTR. I use a different critical faculty to appraise the films because I'm not a paid reviewer. I don't have to focus on what doesn't work. In fact, the child in me comes alive watching those films and I experience this tremendous thrill at seeing these stories brought to the screen as faithfully as they have been; at the special effects, which are now capable of recreating a "realistic" Middle Earth. It's good fun. I understand those who hated the books and the movies; or those who liked the books but hated the movie or vice versa. That's all fine and good and I won't argue with them. I'll just enjoy the film and hope the thrilling moments in text will be transformed into thrilling cinema. Psionic has released his urlLink 20 Significant Tunes of '03 .

I'm always about reclaiming something. I've written before about the continuing effort -- ultimately a lost cause-- to regain time I lost in the last relationship. I'm not even going to point you back to any posts because it would just annoy you. But if you want a taste, sample some of the writing in April - June '03 and you'll find more than enough second-guessing and wailing and gnashing of teeth to satisfy you. This weekend, though, I was able to reclaim space . My ex, who moved out in late June, came by to pick up the last of his stuff from his old room. The bf and I were away Saturday afternoon and when we got back in the evening, the room was emptied of his bed, etc. I know... six months is kind of a long time for a former roommate to come by and pick up the bed. But such was the case with the ex. I didn't push the matter because I figured it's his bed, I'm certain he'll be around to pick it up. When it became clear that wasn't the case, I sent an email. He wrote back saying he'd though of coming over to move his belongings, but he didn't want me there when he was there. He said a mixture of "anger and ego" prevented him from having a more in-depth conversation with me than the hellos we exchanged in public. Whatever. I gave him the tools he needed to look good to his friends as our relationship ended. I gave him the opportunity to play the hurt-person, the sadly betrayed, the forlorn former-friend-- whatever pathetic role he wanted to play to get sympathy. And I said nothing publicly about what happened to counter his stories. I figure any "anger and ego" he's still experiencing are the result of his own guilt. Whatever. The best thing in the world-- next to reclaiming time-- is reclaiming space. And yesterday, I moved my desk from the master bedroom upstairs to the bedroom below. I moved in some bookshelves, my boyfriend painted and after a couple hours, I had a new... hmm... study. Library. Den. Room. Whatever you call it, it's mine now. The point isn't to try to get something back that's long gone. The point is to make the best use of what you have now. Where should I put my lava lamp?
If you're a deposed despot on the run, who is about to be captured, you can avoid a great deal of embarassment by taking a bath before the troops rush in.
To my mind, there's still no better way to start the day-- or the weekend-- then with a visit to the coffee shop at 8am. The gym will come later, friends will come later. On this Saturday, holiday parties and friend's dinners will come later. Now it's my time. The notebook is running, the link back to the house established, the newspapers downloading, the urlLink Blue Room streaming. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. Among all the faces of those dropping through for a quick spot o' coffee on the way to Home Depot are those I see here every Saturday morning at 8am. The guy with the portable DVD player studying for some class, the professor with his papers on environmental impact, the gray haired gentleman in flannel who always has a book. There's a kind of ritual of self-enjoyment to Saturday morning. And looking around me, I can pick out those who enjoy it as much as I do. When I was younger, the point was not to be up at this hour. The point was to be out late the night before and then to either bring someone home or be the someone taken home. But a couple years ago, I fell out of that phase of late night carousing on Fridays and waking up at noon at Saturday. I discovered a new kind of self-indulgence, almost a decadence, in getting up at dawn on Saturday, excited by the knowledge of a full day and full weekend ahead. That's why Sunday morning can never feel the same. Saturday morning is about promise.
urlLink Chrisonomicon was the first weblogger I came across in my search for a new kind of community online. I was looking for a new audience to speak to, new individuals with other experiences living other lives in other places who could reflect a part of myself back to me. I was trying to understand myself as a gay man and what that gay identity meant for all aspects of my life... sex, politics, love, music, books, friends. I found it among other webloggers. Individuals who shared with me the love of men but whose outlook on life, love of books, music, sex, politics was different. Individuals who shared some of their lives online. Weblogging is an expression of ego, to some extent. Detractors assume this is primarily why we present ourselves in this way. But they're wrong. We want something else... a connection not merely to a larger world but a connection to other individuals. It's a connection I feel with readers, but most strongly with the webloggers whom I've monitored almost daily... as one monitors a friend. Not necessarily with a visit or a phone call... but regularly with an instant message or an email or a comment. More than most other webloggers, I've felt a special connection to Chrisonomicon. It was his thoughtful posts, his emails, the occasional IM, the occasional conspiratorial wink or nod, a secret venture. His decision to end his weblog ends one aspect of this connection. But I think there's something bigger that remains. Thanks, Chris, for the many times that you wrote out my thoughts more clearly than I could think them. Good luck to you in life... and with Mike.
Can it be possible that I've missed "Angels in America"?!?!??? And what about "Battlestar Galactica"??!?!?! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME!!!!!! breathe.... thank gawd for TiVo
I'm so glad to get to Friday. It's not been an unmanageable week but it seems to have been long. And my sleep schedule was a little messed up, which didn't help things. Yesterday, I decided to take a nap, and that became 5 hours of peaceful sleep. When I got up at 7pm, I had a phone message asking if I could do Audible's version of the urlLink Wall Street Journal on short notice, since the daily reader was sick. That reading takes place overnight so I was happy I had followed that whim earlier and taken the nap. But the result is probably going to be another nap this afternoon. Not so short that I'm too tired tonight and not so long that I'm awake for half the night. Saw De last night at the bar. I had stopped in to grab a bite to eat and read a magazine. I tapped him on the shoulder as I walked through the bar saying hi to friends... and when he had a free minute, he came over to talk. De and I dated for a few weeks earlier this year. He's a great guy... cute, built, fuckin' smart, intellectually stimulating. It was nice to chat and for the umpteenth time, I wondered... why didn't things work out with him? Sometimes I think that for every guy I've dated that was a bad choice, soon discovered... there has been another one who might have been a perfect fit. The reason it didn't work? Timing. Simply timing. I don't know what you do about that. It hardly seems fair. For something as important as a relationship, it shouldn't survive or fail based merely on a series of unfortunate circumstances. If fate can bring two people together, it should remove the impediments that drown a perfectly good relationship. Of the 6 guys I've dated, of which 5 were breakups (of course), I can think of three guys I dated with whom I could have had a great life. One thing or another prevented them from working... distance or timing. God... timing? It just doesn't seem fair. If you end up with the right guy, does it matter? Probably not. But still...timing. The weekend will be low key... sleep, books, a holiday party and dinner with my friend Chris's parents on Saturday night.
If you've not done so yet... visit the website of the Toledo Blade, the little newspaper that serves the readers in northwest Ohio... and read the series of reports of the urlLink massacres in Vietnam conducted by members of the US Tiger Force. The Blade has spent 8 months researching the records of what happened... has spoken to families of Vietnamese victims... members of Tiger Force still living... and Army officials. In 1967, Tiger Force troops fought in the central highlands of South Vietnam. Order broke down within the unit and what follows appears to have been indiscriminate killing of unarmed civilians... atrocities taking place over a period of 7 months. One documented atrocity reported in the series: Women and children were intentionally blown up in underground bunkers. Elderly farmers were shot as they toiled in the fields. Prisoners were tortured and executed - their ears and scalps severed for souvenirs. One soldier kicked out the teeth of executed civilians for their gold fillings. Two soldiers tried to stop the killings, but their pleas were ignored by commanders. When Tiger Force appeared on a path leading to a village 20 miles west of Tam Ky, the people scurried for [a bunker]. Tiger Force soldiers told investigators they remembered seeing women and children crawl through the openings. No one knows how many were inside, but it didn't matter. When the soldiers reached the bunker entrances, they "knew what to do," Pvt. Ken Kerney told investigators. Without trying to talk to the people below, the soldiers pulled the clips on their grenades, and dropped the explosives through the holes. Setting up camp nearby, soldiers heard human cries coming from the underground shelters throughout the night. No one knows exactly how many died in this, or the many other, atrocities that were commited between May and November, 1967. The Army launched a 4-1/2 year investigation into what happened... collecting 2,000 pages of testimony. Despite a flawed investigation, the Blade reports the Army substantiated 20 war crimes committed by 18 soldiers. No one was charged, nothing happened. And the case remained largely a secret until the Blade series. The response from the national press was muted when the series first appeared in October. But the New Yorker did a piece on it in November. NBC News and other organizations are said to be preparing stories. There's been reporting of the piece in urlLink The Guardian and a number of independent media organizations. The piece is shocking. The reports of atrocities against unarmed men, women and children turn one's stomach. And the defiant attitude expressed today by some of those involved in the massacres is disgusting. Americans should read the series, to understand what happens to young men in war without proper leadership. What's more difficult to understand is the persistent coverup of what happened. But those reasons also become clear in the Blade series.
urlLink DannyBunny , deep within the heart of .sg , links urlLink this video of what has to be the world's longest line outside the Ginza Apple Store in Tokyo on November 30th. The true impact comes from watching the video in its entirety. Remember the classic "1984" Mac ad? Apparently, Mac fans have become line-clinging proles just like the rest of us. Speaking of which... I'm in that line, drooling over the new urlLink iBook G4 . And now The Whip ... without the annoyance of urlLink Aaron Brown : These urlLink three boys seem to be teetering on the edge of a big chat about cheating. I'm waiting for the fireworks. urlLink He and his bf are buying a condo. urlLink Adda' is counting the days to Christmas and working up a dinner date that will get him some dessert. You go, babe! urlLink Devon prepares to get his balls waxed. Todd admits he's not particularly horrified at the thought of urlLink Reagan on a dime . After all, it's the smallest piece of legal tender we have. Homer tells the urlLink truly wrenching story of his grandmother , a woman abused as a child, who mistreated others as an adult. Jockohomo is back... urlLink weaving words like gossamer threads. Waremouse opens a well-written and deserved urlLink attack on David Brooks. The Bobo is allowed to spew regularly from the pages of the New York Times these days. Zeitzeuge's urlLink story about the sunday school teacher telling her children that "santa" also spells "satan" is a familiar one. I was presented with that same strange fact, growing up in church back in Iowa. But the story also reminds me of the prank I witnessed in my hometown on one wintery December Saturday morning back in 1994. The sign in front of the Dairy Queen: "Kids Meet Satan Today 1-3."
Classical radio host urlLink Mark Sheldon died Monday. urlLink He was 43 . Mark had a rare form of ocular cancer, which recently spread to his liver. I first met Mark about 14 years ago. He was in Utah at the time, hosting classical music. His talent at the microphone took him to urlLink Minnesota Public Radio , where his duties included hosting the national broadcasts of the Minnesota Orchestra. He later hosted music on Classical Public Radio... the national broadcasting venture of urlLink Colorado Public Radio and urlLink KUSC in Los Angeles. Mark sang with the Dale Warland Singers, one of the premier performing ensembles in the country, he conducted, but probably his greatest impact will be on the urlLink millions of urlLink classical urlLink radio urlLink listeners urlLink across the urlLink country who urlLink heard and enjoyed Mark every day. Our thoughts go out to his partner Dan Macey and his family and friends.
It always happens the morning after I have four glasses of wine at a party. I wake up thinking, "Why did I have four glasses of wine?" For a lightweight like me, two glasses is just fine. I feel a very slight buzz, I get to drink some wine, which I enjoy, but I don't get slobbery, I don't strip to my underwear and dance, I don't wake up feeling... puffy . That's the best word I can think of to describe the feeling. I'm thirsty as hell, my voice is raspy, and I move slowly. It's not hangover... or maybe it is, without the headache. I don't know... it's not like I got drunk. After all, it was a holiday party for work... and as you can imagine, this is the last place where you want to have a little too much to drink and make a fool of yourself. Not that others always follow this rule. But that's not my problem. I like these parties because everyone seems to have a good time and it's a chance to bring everyone together and meet people you've seen around the building but have never said more than Hi . A number of us are gay; it used to be that most of us were single. But after a few years, many of the older ones have partnered up. It changes the dynamic when you're partnered. You begin by checking in with all the couples.. how's life, what are holiday plans, are you going on a cruise, how's the new house, how's the dog... stuff like that. Then, after we finish catching up with each other, we focus our attention on the young gay boys... who are those boys they brought the party... are they dating... i saw that guy's date at the gym... that one over there dances on a cruise ship. After we've finished the gossip, then us older gay guys make separate trips to the younger gay boys to introduce boyfriends, and to try to remember what life was like before we were planning holiday parties, buying new houses, etc.
Hot damn... those Dean folks are pretty happy today, I'll bet. The endorsement from Al Gore is huge and you can read more about it in today's urlLink Post and the urlLink Times . The urlLink Dean website is still being coy. OK... so where does this leave us? In my estimation, Lieberman, Braun, Sharpton, Edwards, Kucinich are out the door. Oh, wait a minute: that's not exactly news to anyone except to them. A few of my weblog friends are openly for Dean and I feel kind of funny because I'm still sitting on the fence. I'm still looking over at Clark to see how he talks about the issues. I like Clark a lot so he gets some extra time to prove himself. But for me, and most Democrats, the bottom line is, who can win against Bush? Dean and Clark could do it, in my opinion. But Dean has the clear edge over Clark. Up till yesterday, I think it was still arguable that Dean was vulnerable in some key areas like Iowa. It's not exactly certain how the endorsement will affect the polls... but we're also not stupid. No matter what... it's time to get beyond this ridiculous idea among some Democrats that Dean is unelectable. Democrats still talking about this need to read the newspaper and see what Dean is saying these days, how he is saying it, and how voters are responding. But this news about Dean pales next to the emergency I face this morning: no oatmeal. Breakfast is postponed until further notice.
Digging through weblogs this morning to see who has posted and who hasn't. Among the findings... urlLink waremouse visits a diner that reminds him of a TGI Friday's imagined by Tyree Guyton, whose Heidelberg Project was much praised and criticized in Detroit a few years ago. Nothing much to add to that... just was tickled by the reference and the mind picture it created. Ultrasparky provides a urlLink much more placid view of this weekend's snowfall. urlLink Tin Man writes a thoughtful piece about "hitting the wall"... struggling to complete multi-stage projects that can't be finished in a flash and handed in. He looks at the piles on his desk and feels that sinking feeling. Oh how true. Probably the most difficult time I have with my own motivation is my lack of interest in accomplishing major tasks. I have this mindset that demands a quick finish to any project I undertake... even ones that require many steps and a lot of time to complete. When I get a big project, I find I often delay getting to work on it because I consider it as a whole and resist breaking it down into its constituent parts. The sheer size of the project makes me want to wait until I have "more time" to devote to it. Eventually, I get the work done because I have to and I'm never as satisfied with the results because I know I could have worked much harder. I suppose this might be something I could ignore since much of my day-to-day work is short-term projects. But if I ever decide to go for a Master's degree or more I might be in trouble. How do you change habits like that?
OK... so I'm back here at the Des Moines International Airport (motto: "Featuring Flights to Other States") for another early flight out. This time around the wireless Internet is up and running. And I swear urlLink that same girl I saw two months ago is here. On a flight to Minneapolis St. Paul, same as before. No sign of the boyfriend who clung to her like the flu bug the last time around. No sign of that nice woman with the British accent who mucked up everyone's check-in experience this morning. She walked up just as me and Minneapolis Girl were finishing automated check-in... and then proceeded to keep the Northwest agent busy for about 5 minutes with a bunch of ridiculous questions about when her flight was, what gate it took off from, if she could change her seat, how far down the list was she for first class, etc. We stood waiting patiently, (well, Minneapolis Girl was patient) watching the British woman go on and on. Finally, she seemed satisfied and stepped away from the counter and Minneapolis Girl and I both dove for it. If either one of us had stood there for 5 minutes asking that many dumb questions and chuckling about how we'd tried to check-in over the Internet but couldn't... we'd have been led away by security. The woman got away with it because she smiled the whole time she was asking questions. She had a British accent, which seems to make even the most annoying people charming. She was also really short. Who wouldn't find a dwarfish woman with a British accent interesting? I, for one. I should add, in the interests of full disclosure, that Minneapolis Girl and I were both there close to 2 hours ahead of our flight. So we weren't exactly pressed for time. I gotta hand it to Des Moines TSA employees, though. I experienced a flawless security check-in... after some recent annoying experiences there. First of all, there are more employees on the scene than last time. More of them actually appear to be working. That can never be a bad thing. And they've learned to be less brusque. And this is a good thing because if I'm practically undressing in front of someone at 4am and I'm not about to get dick, I'm going to be a little surly myself and I don't need some service employee trying to act like he's a cop. I still have no confidence in their ability to thwart a terrorist. Tactic #1 in their manual still seems to be lure terrorist away from plane with cheese .
Did I mention that after meeting urlLink Dennis DeYoung last night, I thought he was pretty cool? I found him to be rather down-to-earth and not at all the kind of guy you would expect to be calling a has-been. This morning, he was the talk of the coffee shop where I was doing my reading. And the funny part was that of the almost dozen comments I overhead from talking about the TV show last night, I would estimate that about three-quarters had to do with how he seemed so down-to-earth. So, I guess you could call it the effective projection of personality. I'm ready to be back home, to be out of the suburban-hell I've been living in for the past few days. I spend close to a month here every year doing TV work, and as much as I like it, I can't stand all the driving around. Driving to get to a decent (read non-suburban ) coffee shop, driving to the gym, driving wherever I want to go. I do enough driving at home, but I have this theory that driving in the suburbs is worse than in cities. The traffic is higher as people try to get to the malls, etc. I don't know... it seems worse. Or maybe it's my bias against the suburbs that's expressing itself. Oh, and let's hear it for my alma mater, Iowa State... which made hash out of Iowa today in urlLink wrestling . The 'clones are now 7-0 for the season but the win against rival Iowa was particularly sweet! Our first win over Iowa since 1987.
Is it just me... or is there a major blogger turnover taking place? Over the past few months, I've had a few conversations with some of the better known bloggers on the list to my right... and I've heard something similar from several of them: the weblog thing has been fun and they might keep going for a while longer but the time might soon be drawing to a close. I didn't think much about those various conversations at the time... particularly because the writers of the weblogs I read most frequently might have made statements like that, but they've continued to write. It's only in the past few weeks, that I've started to pay attention to the numbers of individuals on my list and elsewhere in blog world-- some of them quite prominent-- who have closed their weblogs, or have gone on some kind of extended hiatus with little or no indication of when they might return. I've been holding on to a number of quiet or plainly defunct weblogs in my own linklist. But I've found myself dropping names off the new list. And frankly, it's kind of sad to say goodbye, if only virtually, to these people who decided to share their lives and their interests with us. I'm not going to try to wax eloquent about it, but its funny how-- after you've been given access to someone's life for awhile-- that you feel like your life has somehow been entwined with theirs. And after a few weeks go by, when it becomes apparent that your favorite weblogger is on more than a short vacation, there's this strange sense of loss that you feel about this person whom you've likely never met in person and probably never will meet. You don't know what they're doing anymore; what's happened to them. This internet is an odd thing. I've been online for 10 years as of next month and some of you have been on for much longer. For a long time, people found various reasons to hate or fear the Internet. In that way, they treated it like any other invention that has had a profound impact on people's lives. The automobile was going to be the downfall of civilization; then the radio; then TV. The list is long. It never turns out to be true. And one of the charges about how impersonal and superficial the Internet is... has turned out to be a much more complicated picture than people once thought. If any of you former writers are still reading, and I know some of you are, thanks for sharing and don't be a stranger!
After spending last night with Yanni... it's almost too much to think that tomorrow night I'll be fundraising with Dennis DeYoung of Styx. Kill me. Actually, Yanni was a pretty nice guy although something of a primadonna, I suppose. I never know what to think about that, though. I mean, if you're a star and people are always running after you for an autograph or to ask you for something or, just by their very presence, are making some kind of demand on you... then I suppose you will behave in a certain way to protect yourself-- to build some kind of a wall around yourself to restrict access. He might just be quite vain, I'm not sure. But it seems like most people I meet who are well-known use their "attitude" as a shield. I'm kind of amused about meeting Dennis DeYoung. Styx was really big when I was a kid. I guess he's started a solo act recently... hmmm. He's doing a tour and one presumes, he's singing some of those old classics (?) like Mr. Roboto. I'm in Ames, Iowa, this afternoon-- home of Iowa State University. It's my old stomping grounds... in one of my favorite coffee places up here... borrowing wireless internet, reading the newspapers and just generally taking it easy. My forearms are closed to being healed. The pain is almost gone and while the soreness in the brachioradialis still prevents me from doing chinups, I can do many more of my biceps/triceps exercises than I could even a week ago. I think we got about 3 inches of snow in Ames... more like an inch in Des Moines overnight. Winter is here. I've been asked to publicly endorse Howard Dean... so I'm thinking about that. I like the guy a lot... a number of his policies are on track with what seems right to me. But I just haven't taken that extra step yet of deciding that I'm "for" him-- or anyone else, for that matter. I don't feel a strong attachment to any of the candidates. The closest matches are Dean and Clark. But so far, neither one has really broken through that barrier for me. In that way, I think I speak for a lot of us Democrats... there are a big bunch of us who aren't sure what to do yet. My state holds its primary/caucus thingy in February, so I have plenty of time to decide. And we can always hope something definitive will occur in the next few weeks. Being back here in Iowa is a reminder of just how heated this contest in -- at least here. The candidates' commercials are on TV all the time. I mean it. You can't escape them. Yesterday's New York Times reported the top four Democratic candidates have bought 4,400 ads in the Des Moines TV market alone. It's a kind of saturation that must annoy the hell out of Iowans. For me, it's fun because I've only read about the commercials-- not seen them. I have to say I like this new language they use at the end of the ads-- the language where the candidate says he's approved the ad. The campaigns are required to include along with the image of the candidate saying the words and they're becoming pretty creative in weaving the statement into the general message. They need to: it takes about 4 seconds to say it.
My friend Mark is in town from Phoenix. He and I have been friends for about 15 years and no matter how busy we are we always manage to catch up, eventually. He's in town doing some consulting for the company I work for. I went to the airport last night to get him and then we hung out for a couple hours before I called it a (very late) night. He's going to be here for a couple of days... but I'm out of state for the weekend to do some TV work. And just in time for snow. Great!! One to three inches... well, not the end of the world. But it's that moment where one is forced to face the fact that winter is almost here and that snow is likely to follow. I'm almost always one of the last people to accept the reality of winter. It's not that I want to live in the tropics. You know me... if I could, I'd live in New York or DC or Toronto. Those cities aren't exactly oases of warmth in the sea of cold, although most years, Washington DC doesn't get a lot of snow. Last winter was an exception. I know there was at least one 14 inch snowstorm. And why do I think there was another one, too? Hmmm... why am I lazy enough not to bother about looking it up? Because I know one of my pals-- like urlLink Jimbo , or urlLink Cool Relax (come back, CR!!)-- will step in and provide the pertinent details. I feel like one of those tenured professors who asks his minions to go do research and write his articles for him.
There's nothing more annoying than listening to people sitting around complaining about how other people have bad manners. Today's urlLink Diane Rehm Show devoted an hour to "men's etiquette." Fine with me but inevitably, the conversation deteriorates to men and women whining about people who don't let them in line first or who don't open the door for them. I know it's important to be polite. Sure... but endless whining about people who don't open the car door for you isn't polite. It's fucking annoying. Now the conversation has shifted to rude people who aren't sufficiently appreciative of the kindnesses you do for them. Save me!
"Ever Seen a Cow Have an Orgasm?"
I haven't figured out what I want for Christmas yet. Not only what I want to ask for. But also what I want to get for myself. I'm newcomer to this idea of giving yourself a present, too. I had no idea how common this was until a couple years ago. And to think, for all these years I've deprived myself of the joys of giving-- to me. For myself, I'm likely to choose an outboard hard drive, which would be good for archiving/backup purposes. But as far as electronics go, it's not terribly sexy. Not as sexy as the urlLink 43 inch DLP HDTV from Samsung at Best Buy. Every time I stop in at Best Buy, I try not to drool too much over the display, which is one of the hottest I've seen, short of a $9,000 plasma screen. I'm like a lot of people, I think. I've made the plans to transition to HDTV soon, but the moment when I'll make the transition is up in the air. Heck, there's still time. The official date for changeover was supposed to be 2006, but TV stations are far enough behind on the transition that it will be years before the analog signals disappear. So, since my current TV is still working well, I don't feel a lot of pressure to buy something new. Now is the time for investigating the options and that means lots of staring at screens looking for slight differences in color and clarity. Those new LCD screens are hot, too. Oh yeah, and then there's the cost of the screen. And then, once you buy it, it's time to get all the other pieces in place. I'd have to buy a new DVD player with a DVI output... an HDTV receiver for satellite and over-the-air TV, maybe a new 6.1 system. Damn, this is getting expensive. Especially when you consider that most of my TV viewing is limited to Charlie Rose. Ah, but won't Charlie look great on a big screen?
A long night awake... at work on a freelance project. I got some sleep Sunday evening, but most of it would have to wait for today when I got home from work. I had a nap, hit the gym, had dinner while watching a cached episode of Charlie Rose and now it's time to write for a while and then read and then to bed. And so ends Monday. Damn, I was basically able to encapsulate the day's "highlights" in two short sentences. Like a lot of Mondays I know. But I'm happy to report the first of the "Spirit of the Holidays" is beginning to hit me. Most of us don't get all excited and wild about Christmas anymore. We're tired, jaded, with no time for Christmas trees and many of the other trappings of the holidays. Not everyone, but I definitely count myself among the jaded. But there is one thing that gets me excited about the holiday. And that's music. I like carols performed well, by some great ensemble like the King's College Choir (the first CD I ever bought, now out of print). I also get in the mood for chant, and medieval and renaissance music. It's a constant favorite of mine but the interest goes on steriods over the holidays. Groups like urlLink The Tallis Scholars (visiting America, including my city, next year), and urlLink Pomerium . The music is austere and even though it's speaking to us from a distant time, there is a transformational quality to it. So for me the sign that I've finally gotten into the holiday spirit is the day I take a new stack of CD's to the truck and eject all the house mixes. Temporarily. Seeing "Elf" Saturday night was a great way to spend $8.75. It ain't gonna save the world and it does nothing for Iraq or Medicare or Howard Dean, but it was so relaxing to step into something else for close to 2 hours and have a few good laughs at guileless comedy.
urlLink Today's Washington Post has a priceless piece on the young rising star in the fast-paced sport of Competitive Eating . She's Sonya Thomas; yes, she's a young woman competing in a man's world, and yes, she has to be the best. Hello, urlLink Christopher Guest ... here's your next movie idea.
I've been meaning to toss out this recommendation for some time. For a great mix of hip-hop and house and lots o' stuff in between, check out urlLink Across the Line on Thursdays from BBC Radio Ulster. Good music every week and you can listen on-demand. The other 3 must-listen shows are on Radio 1: urlLink The Essential Selection , urlLink Dance Anthems and urlLink The Blue Room . I'm typing to ATL now... that's the Friday tradition... and I listen to the other shows on Saturday and Sunday. Thinking about the fact that, even as we speak, it's 35 degrees warmer in Vancouver, and yet, I'm here. My urlLink golfer's elbow is healing well, at last. I've been wearing an odd little strap on my arm for a few weeks and doing extra wrist curls and stuff and finally, the pain is less sharp and I can life heavier weights. Thank God, my biceps felt like they were disappearing. But the problem with golfer's elbow is that you can feel the discomfort working just about any body part-- at least the parts you might work publicly in the gym. That's what makes it most difficult to deal with. The best thing to do is stop working out and rest. Needless to say, this hasn't been my approach. Only someone in their right mind would have the sense to lay aside the workout for anywhere from 6-12 weeks for a full course of healing. I mean, fuck, I brush my teeth twice a day, wear clean underwear and socks... what more do you want??!?! Last week at BodySmith, I was talking with the trainer about ways to deal with it. He said, you can rest it for several weeks and that's the best way to get quick healing. I asked him if that's what he would do and he laughed. Good enough for me. What won't be happening anytime soon are the preacher curl-style movements. The stretch and tension is too much for right now. No respectable gay man would utter the previous sentence, though, without resolving to keep working at it. Right, boys? :)
I should have gone somewhere warm this weekend. But I didn't. I'll be here where its 15 degrees during the day and 0 at night. And what will I be doing? Not sure. Last night, I even looked up weekend rates at my favorite hotel in Toronto before I realized I was thinking of going where it was colder . There's likely to be a movie or maybe I'll go to the bar tonight and commisserate with my Howard Dean-supporting friends. Dean supporters come in clumps-- have you noticed this? There's a group in your workplace. The past two weeks have brought these large-group emotional swings... and this week, the Dean people have ranged from glum to angry. Kinda brings everybody down. Buy a Dean supporter a drink this weekend. Just don't buy them too many.
Here's something kind of funny. I was looking at my budget and discovered I was somewhat off in my spending calculations. I'm actually going to spend about urlLink $500 billion more than I earn. Makes you want to sit the President down, look him in the eye and then give him a hard slap on the face. Or move to Canada. I drowned my sorrows by eating a Fuji apple, my favorite, and a bowl of French Vanilla yogurt... neither of which I purchased with borrowed money. I would drink... but I'm a sensible guy and know I need to get up early tomorrow.
I thought the class discussion went well yesterday. (I led it.) I wasn't nervous or anything, but I wasn't over-confident. But rarely am I over-confident. Whenever I do something, my state of mind ranges from extreme trepidation to, at best, confident. I don't come with enough brains to think I'm the best at things. And even if I think I'm good, I don't think I'm that good. Keeps me on my toes, I suppose. I also don't like preparation. Never have. I don't believe in being unprepared. I will prepare lightly, and then go with it. Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't. How many times have I gotten burned? Well... we won't go into that. But in my profession, I used to over-prepare and when I cut back a little, it helped tremendously. I don't know that this idea applies that well to academics, but up to a point, the less you prepare, the more open and aware you are of things around you. I don't know how else to describe that. Think of it in the profession of interviewer. Charlie Rose is well-prepared. He knows his stuff, for the most part. But most of the time, he doesn't know too much. And that makes him very aware of what the guest is saying. Maybe what I'm saying is that the more you prepare, the more closed to outside stimuli you become. This doesn't apply to every profession, or even to some sports, but there is some value to "being loose." Hmmm... yes, there is value to being loose. Yes. So anyway... is it Friday yet? I think this week has moved very slowly. I'm ahead a day, even though I'm probably behind 2 days in terms of the work I need to get done. And if anyone saw my loft, I'd instantly lose my status as a gay man. I need a houseboy.
God, I'm sick of snow... but in winter and in the northeast... saying one is sick of snow begs the question, doesn't it? We've had a few days of it and there's probably going to be more of it next week. And then there's the ice and salt and shit all over cars. Well, again... I think if you tallied the number of weblog entries being composed at this very minute about snow, you'd think all of this was a complete waste of time. And we know that this isn't... right? Um... right? M and I have just finished the political discussion du jour , namely, should Dean pull out after next week's primaries or wait till Super Tuesday on March 2. Kind of a goofy, meaningless exercise, I suppose, but one of the things that has always interested me about campaigns is how long one should press on after the writing appears on the wall. It appeared in Iowa, as I wrote here last week. We shall see. The same could be said of other candidates, who shall remain nameless. I've put the finishing touches on "Angels in America" and this afternoon, I'll lead the class discussion on the second play "Perestroika." I've never led a class discussion before, unless you count Sunday School. And let's just say that those discussions weren't memorable. This one may not be either, which is a problem because our professor is great at asking hard, searching questions. I've tried to come up with some that probe the text and Kushner's ideas. If I don't bring up the class in the next post, it either means it went well or it didn't. I don't report... you decide.
A very cagey Howard Dean on NPR's Morning Edition this morning... refusing to answer a number of questions on which other candidates often muse. A strange interview and I think it indicates a change in assessment of the situation inside the campaign. I'll explain more of this later and the NPR audio will be online in a couple hours.
This is the latest interpretation from the urlLink Washington Post : The exit polls showed Kerry with a commanding lead in the urban centers of Manchester, Nashua and Portsmouth, and Dean running evenly with him elsewhere in the state, the AP reported. Kerry's support was broad-based with equally strong support among women and men and all age groups. His support was slightly higher among those whose financial situations have deteriorated in the last four years, according to the poll, which was conducted for the AP and television networks by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International. Kerry dominated among those who chose their candidate only in the last week, winning the support of half of those voters. By a 2-to-1 margin, voters said they backed Kerry because they think he can defeat President Bush, the poll showed. Dean ran strongly among liberals, war opponents, people angry at Bush and those who thought the most important quality in a candidate was standing up for his beliefs. He lagged behind Kerry among voters who most wanted a candidate who could beat Bush and who had the most experience, the poll showed. The exit poll results, based on interviews conducted with voters as they left the polls, showed that about half of voters considered themselves Democrats, and nearly that many called themselves independent or "something else." Forty-eight percent said they or someone else in their household had served in the U.S. military. About a third said they had finally decided on a candidate within the past three days. Asked to name the one issue that mattered most in deciding which candidate to support, the largest number of those polled -- about 30 percent -- cited "health care/Medicare," an issue that Kerry repeatedly emphasized. About a fifth said their biggest concern was the economy and jobs, while a similar share said it was the war in Iraq. About eight in 10 said they were very or somewhat worried about the direction of the nation's economy in the next few years.
Note the differences from Iowa here in NH as the urlLink New York Times interprets the exit poll data: Exit polls indicated that health care, the war in Iraq and the economy were on the voters' minds. Two-thirds said they opposed the war, a making it a possibly potent issue for November in New Hampshire, which President Bush narrowly carried in 2000. The antiwar sentiment may also have helped Dr. Dean, who has opposed the Iraq campaign. Pre-primary polls had showed him behind Mr. Kerry by double-digit figures. Several pre-primary polls had shown that as many as three voters in 10 might go to their voting places undecided, or change their mind once they got there. "Standing up for what he believes" was the quality that mattered most to about 3 in 10 voters, with the ability to defeat President Bush most important to about 2 in 10. When the question was put slightly differently — asking voters whether defeating President Bush or agreeing with a candidate on the major issues was more important — more than half the voters said that agreeing with the candidate was more important. Just over a third said the ability to defeat Mr. Bush was more important, while the rest had no answer.
Did I say snow? I meant weather-related-program-activity.
Monday dawns, or will dawn at some point. I don't expect we'll see a lot of sun today. There will be some more snow today and then more snow (a lot) tomorrow and thus, winter continues. Off and on all weekend, I've been talking to people who want to escape winter in one way or another. I have friends going to Hawaii next month... friends of theirs going south at the first opportunity and at least a few friends I met up with spoke of living and working in warmer climates. DC was chilly all weekend, but it didn't snow until after I flew out yesterday, a rare moment of perfect timing, which I'm not known for when it comes to weather and travel. How did I not accomplish all that I wanted to on this DC trip? Let me count the ways. Hopes and semi-plans for meeting up with friends and bloggers fell by the wayside as other things intervened. With time running out on the trip Saturday afternoon, I zipped down the block to Health Bar and spent about an hour and a half with urlLink Waremouse . Regular readers of his website know that he went to Iowa to volunteer for the Dean campaign. He's been less than happy since he came back but he was in good form Saturday. I probably forced too much of the conversation to politics but it's been on my mind a lot lately. John has been thinking about it a lot, too... before and after his Iowa experience. In any case, that was a highlight... always nice to meet a fellow blogger. A big highlight of the trip was a training session at urlLink BodySmith that I got for Christmas from Chris and David. No matter how much you train or have trained in the past, a session with an expert from time to time is great for getting advice on training, form, etc. I'm coming off a forearm injury, which is improving quickly. So, the trainer worked with me on developing a new workout plan for the next couple months and on improving a few aspects of my form. Just the help I needed to keep the workout fresh and to gain some more confidence with the sorry state of my leg workout. I had hoped to see "Fog of War" and "The Battle of Algiers" while in DC. But there wasn't enough time so those will have to come later.
I've not said this for a week, but what is a personal weblog about if not for personal thoughts? I smell death in the Dean campaign. It's not just poll numbers. It's a personal political instinct that is sometimes wrong, but that signals an implosion occurring. For more than a week, I watched the numbers slide in Iowa and said nothing. I watched a couple caucuses, picked through the entrance poll data, watched the now infamous Dean gaffe Monday night, and how the campaign has reacted since. I'm obviously not the only one paying attention and I'm not the only one seeing this, I would bet. Deaniacs are blaming media, negative campaigning, etc. And all have played a role. But what they can't see because of their deep devotion to the candidate is the deep uncertainty others have about him, or the cumulative damage Dean has inflicted on himself. The entrance poll numbers in Iowa are stark. And while Iowa is a big bunch of old white people, what they are saying is appearing elsewhere in focus groups and polls. I won't say it's over, for a couple of reasons. I think it's too soon, I might be wrong, and I feel bad because I like Dean a lot. But politics is as much about gut and intuition as it is about numbers and research. Now, if I was really courageous and willing to stand up to my Dean friends, I would pull the cursor over this post and hit the delete key, leaving two sentences: Politics is as much about gut and intuition as it is about numbers and research. I smell death in the Dean campaign.
The Todd DC Vacation Model: get up early; have coffee; read papers; talk; have lunch; read; gym; hang out; read; dinner; espresso; friends; alcohol; read; bed. This city isn't about tourist things to me, although I've done 'em. It's about relaxing, which is a strange thing to say in a city that one would think rarely relaxes. But it does relax and it's one of the more social (networking) cities I've been to.
I just did something I hadn't done in several years: I had Taco Bell for breakfast. I won't go into the exciting array of options available to fliers here at Detroit Metro who are interested in fine dining. To be precise, there are none. So I skipped all the carbs and went right for the fat. So, now that I feel like shit... I'm on my way to DC. For new readers, Washington DC is known to many as Our Nation's Capital.
My friends and me are so smart. We can spout political analysis just like the rest of them. Give us an hour of NPR or a New York Times article and we become experts. Isn't that what the pundits do? Basically. But by last night, there was no more to say. We were working through political analysis version 3 and we stopped and looked at each other. Done. No more. Well, there's always real life, right? Real life ain't so fun. The cold isn't bone-chilling here in my part of the world-- 20 degrees during the day, 5 degrees at night. But it's quickly becoming intolerable. You can just tell when people have had enough. People are getting cranky and what starts it is the snow that doesn't melt on the pavement. A week later, you're thinking, what the fuck with the old snow?!?!? The warmup is promised again and again, but I'm not waiting. I'm going to DC tomorrow. I know, not exactly Miami but it's 15 degrees warmer. I'm not a warm weather guy. I was born in the upper midwest and I don't mind some cold and some snow. The thing about living where I live is that we don't get very cold and we don't get a lot of snow. That works well in the broad sense, but the details get annoying. I've probably overbooked the time in DC. I need personal reading time, I need time at The Diner for drinking and boy-watching, I need the daily workout at Results (not for boy-watching... well, OK, if you insist), I need time with my best friend, Chris, to plot my DC strategy and discuss boy-related issues. My friend Rick, those cool, friendly DC blogo-boys, the puppy. And even though it's cold, I just have to stand outside, look down Connecticut Ave and breathe deeply. cough cough I'm home!
Until the New Hampshire primary, I'll confine my political ramblings to my urlLink news weblog . There comes a point where, even in the most nuanced discussion of what happened last night, you discover the pundits are repeating themselves. You listen to them on NPR, read them in the papers, watch them on TV and you realize that any given platitude uttered at any given moment could be coming out of the mouth of any given pundit. Well, that's no surprise. Two more highlights before I move on to real life . The Washington Post notes the "peculiar nature" of the Iowa Caucuses: The Iowa caucuses remain baffling to many Americans and quaint or strange to many foreign observers. "There are many oddities about the Iowa race," BBC News reported on its Web site. It "feels a little bit like a highly politicized dinner party, where guests are invited to disagree politely with each other. Many bring pies, cookies and drinks and it is probably one of the most homely election processes in the world." The other highlight: CSPAN last night broadcast 2 caucuses from start to finish. The larger event was a caucus in Dubuque County where more than 200 people attended. I watched it passively but became riveted at the relentless efforts of one young man, apparently in his early 20's, to shore up support for his chosen candidate, Dennis Kucinich. The camera followed him as he went from room to room, cajoling, begging, strong-arming former Kucinich supporters to rejoin as he tried to stitch together a viable group with Kucinich, Gephardt and Undecided voters. It was a futile quest but it was hard not to root for him and it was true reality TV. Check it out, in the urlLink CSPAN Video Library . Click on "Democratic Caucus from Eastern Iowa." Start watching about 1:27:30 into the video and watch this young man wearing the coat and the stocking cap over the next 20 minutes or so. He's quite a guy.
The Iowa Caucuses didn't produce much in the way of surprises, if you consider the polls leading up to last night. For the past week, Howard Dean's support had been falling, and Kerry and Edwards have been rising. The situation was clear in the oft-maligned Zogby Poll (which is a small sample), it was perfectly clear in the final Iowa Poll released by the Des Moines Register on Sunday, and it was clear in the internal campaign polling conducted by the candidate's organizations-- polls the candidates regularly share with the media on background. There are 4 important stories today. First, Howard Dean's distant third place finish. Joe Trippi is spinning it-- it was the Gephardt negative campaign against Dean, he says, and that brought down Gephardt and nearly brought down Dean. Nice try, but that doesn't tell the whole story by a long shot. The negative campaign was a factor-- both candidates participated actively in it and they continued it even as their support leached away to Kerry and Edwards, which speaks volumes about internal strategy and decisionmaking. But let's look at the data gathered as voters were arriving at the caucuses. Dean captured a third of those voters who described themselves as very liberal. Among more mainstream voters who self-describe as "somewhat liberal," he came in behind Kerry and Edwards. And, most telling, voters who described themselves as moderate deserted Dean, who was a distant third to Kerry and Edwards. In the age breakout, Dean came in second with the youngest voters, in the 17-29 category. But that was his best showing. When asked what one quality was most important in deciding whom to support, a majority of those who chose taking a strong stand on the issues picked Dean over the others. But voters looking for someone to beat George Bush deserted Dean, who was a distant third. The other question asked: which one issue mattered most in deciding whom to support? For those who thought the war in Iraq was the most important, Dean was the easy winner. But for all of the anti-war sentiment in Iowa, the majority of voters said the economy and healthcare were more important than the war, and those voters chose Kerry. New Hampshire will be a new ballgame, but for Dean, there are signs of serious trouble that go much deeper than a negative campaign with Gephardt. The other candidates have discovered, or have had confirmed, Dean's weaknesses. This will be an interesting week. The second story is Kerry's sweep. It's been attributed to political operative extraordinaire urlLink Michael Whouley , but the poll provides some other clues. Most of the Kerry voters made their decision in the past month and more than a third made the decision in the last three days. Why did they do it? When asked which candidate quality was the most important factor in deciding whom to support, those who thought experience was important overwhelmingly chose Kerry. A quarter of the voters thought a candidate who could beat Bush was most important and they readily chose Kerry. Two other stories are worth passing attention. Polling data shows Gephardt's base remained blue-collar voters, but he lost most of those to Kerry. He was the first choice of voters who thought trade policy was the most important issue, but that was a miniscule number of voters. Gephardt leaves the race today, and it's about time. Not because I dislike him, but it's time to narrow the field and reduce clutter. Edwards enjoyed a big bump in Iowa and he'll be the media darling for the coming week. I'm of the opinion that Edwards' success is a blip on the radar screen but I need to do more research before I stand by that opinion. In summary, Dean lost and lost big. But that loss was clear long before last night. The Iowa Caucuses are supposed to reward organization. But last night, Iowa voters made it clear that experience and electability make the difference, and those are Dean's weakest points. On to New Hampshire.
More polling data, from the urlLink New York Times : Iowans who voted in the caucuses were far more likely to cite health care and the economy than the war in Iraq as their most pressing concerns in this election, even after a year in which the war in Iraq significantly shaped the Democratic presidential contest, according to a survey of voters entering caucus sites. The survey found that the caucuses, the most competitive Democratic contest this state has had in at least 16 years, produced a spike of new interest, with about half of caucusgoers saying they were attending their first caucus. At the same time, the survey confirmed what voters here and in New Hampshire have repeatedly said from the start of the year: That defeating President Bush was a top priority for Democratic voters this year. More than a quarter described it as the key consideration in casting their votes. Three in 10 said the decisions were based on the candidates' taking strong stands on issues. In a sign of how the climate here has changed over the last six months, barely 15 percent said the war in Iraq had shaped their final decision, even though 75 percent said they opposed the war. Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, emerged as a major contender here in large part by opposing the war in Iraq, drawing a sharp contrast with three opponents who voted for the war while in Congress: Mr. Gephardt, Mr. Kerry Mr. Edwards. Dr. Dean won barely half the support of voters who called the war in Iraq their top priority. And opponents of the war split almost evenly between Dr. Dean and Mr. Kerry, who voted for the Iraqi resolution in Congress, a position for which he was repeatedly lambasted here during this campaign. The survey also suggested that the central theme of Mr. Gephardt's appeal -- pledging to fight against overly liberal trade agreements -- did not fare well. Barely five percent of voters named that as their top issue; and he won the support of just one-third of union households. Among elderly voters, a key contingent in Iowa, and another target of Mr. Gephardt, Mr. Kerry won the support of about one-third, compared to about one-quarter for Mr. Gephardt. The elderly made up one-third of the electorate.
The Kerry win makes urlLink this article worth looking at again: DAILY EXPRESS The Revivalist by Michael Crowley Only at TNR Online Post date: 01.16.04 It's been a long time since John Kerry got anything resembling good news. In fact, for most of the winter Kerry has been fending off reporters determined to nail his coffin shut. But lo and behold, after several days of steadily climbing in Iowa polls, Kerry may now have a claim to first place there. That's a startling development. Sure, a Kerry win in Iowa hardly makes him the race's front-runner. But it might be his last, best hope for staying alive. There are some obvious reasons for this Kerry comeback. One is the way he essentially gave up on winning New Hampshire and began campaigning constantly in Iowa, in the hope that a surprise finish would slingshot him into New Hampshire with fresh momentum. Another may be a sharpened stump style, and the well-advised dumping of contrived slogans like "The Real Deal." But there might be another, more hidden story--a secret weapon Kerry unleashed in Iowa several weeks ago. His name is Michael Whouley. Michael who? Unless you're a hard-core political junkie, you've probably never even heard the name. But within the Democratic political world, Whouley is an almost-mythical figure. Revered as one of the party's fiercest and most talented ground-level organizers, Whouley is widely credited with saving Al Gore's foundering campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire in the 2000 primaries against Bill Bradley. Now this old Kerry ally may be working his magic one more time. Whouley often seems like a kind of Keyser Soze figure--his fearsome powers are the stuff of legend, but the man himself is rarely seen. Unlike other top campaign operatives, Whouley shuns attention. He avoids shows like "Hardball" and "Crossfire," and you can't find a picture of him on the Web. Whouley is so secretive that in 2000 he wouldn't even walk in front of a C-SPAN camera so his mother-in-law could see him on television. On the phone, Whouley sounds like a 300-pound truck driver--he has a grumbly, profane voice, heavily inflected with the accent he acquired growing up in Boston's working-class Dorchester neighborhood. (In fact, he is short, "balding," and "whip thin," according to The New York Times.) Whouley also hates to be written about. Gore's former campaign manager, Donna Brazile, confided to me yesterday that she'd just gotten off the phone with Whouley. He'd told her "to stop bragging about him" to reporters. But Whouley's track record makes him hard to ignore. Numerous veterans of the 2000 Gore campaign, including Gore himself, give Whouley vast credit for saving Gore's hide from Bill Bradley's primary challenge that year. At the time, Whouley was a fortyish ground operative who had been field director for Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign and, briefly, patronage chief in the White House. He was first dispatched to New Hampshire after a poll showing Bradley with a lead in New Hampshire rocked the complacent Gore campaign. Whouley quickly identified the problem: Gore had been too regal and distant from the voters. He ended Gore's endless endorsement events and forced him to bang on more doors and make himself accessible through long town-hall meetings with undecided voters. They proved highly popular and crucially humanized the stiff vice president.
Having received email asking me why I would be so negative about the wonderful Iowa Caucuses, let me pass along urlLink this article from Slate which offers more detail on what a really undemocratic mess the caucuses are. But even messes have consequences. urlLink Daniel Drezner thinks Edwards is becoming the new media darling and is likely to benefit greatly with press coverage coming out of Iowa, particularly if he can get third or second. If Dean comes in second or worse, expect his campaign to say Iowa really doesn't matter, which is a good point. I mean, what happens after the first round vote, when candidates are forced out and the jockeying begins to gain orphaned supporters for the second or third vote? The lineup can switch significantly because of the odd rules governing how the caucuses work. Right now, polls matter less because what counts is a candidate's organization and his ability to get people to the caucuses. But let me also add this: some believe that being behind a little can help Dean because it will remind supporters that they need to get to the caucuses to vote for their candidate. Normally, this would be the case, but in Iowa, I don't think it is. The problem is, there are few solid supporters of the candidates. Right now, polling and interviews show close to half of Democrats could change their minds and vote for another candidate at the caucuses tonight. That level of uncertainty is rather amazing and it could mean an exciting interesting evening.
I remember my first Iowa caucus. In 1988, I had just become eligible to vote and I was ready to put my finely honed conservative principles into action at this vital instrument of grassroots democracy. What I saw there that night has made me a liberal Democrat. Remember 1988? It was an open field across the board, with Dukakis, et al running on the Democratic side, and the Republicans fielding George HW Bush, Jack Kemp, and the internationally recognized statesman-who-speaks-directly-to-God-- Pat Robertson. I was a true-blood Republican conservative. As far as I was concerned, God had blessed one party and that party stood for all that was good about America. Only the GOP could stand up to the dark forces that threatened our cherished way of life: the Soviet Union (the hollow shell, which collapsed in big heap one decade later) and the liberal special interests promoting their partisan agendas (concern for the poor, gays, lesbians etc.). My family, devout Pentecostals that they were, saw only one candidate capable of helping America weather the tribulations ahead: Pat Robertson. The man who turns away hurricanes with but a word. The President who knows his way around pre-millennial dispensationalism. I was for Kemp. He was tough on communism and special interests and I felt his perfectly combed hair could serve as an effective nuclear shield, should we need it. Robertson seemed to be a little... well... cooky. Caucus night, everyone knew that the Robertson faction had organized better than anyone and his people were ready to jam the meetings and push through a Robertson victory. But the actual vote on the candidates that makes the Iowa caucuses such a "bellwether" of the Presidential campaign comes at the end of about 90 minutes to two hours of discussions about politics. People argue about the candidates, declare their support, defend their choice, try to convince others to switch their vote, pass "resolutions" to send to the candidates, pass the party platform, and eat. "Democracy" is Iowan for "Bring Dish to Pass." "This is the quintessence of democracy," the media tells us, as it paints a picture of small-town democracy. The truth is, the caucuses are a trifle less lofty. My caucus was at the county fairgrounds, where a bunch of caucus groups were meeting. Looking around me, I realized it had happened-- Pat Robertson had unleashed the Great Unwashed. They poured from the church doors into the fairgrounds building wearing a Robertson button on their lapels and their religion on their sleeves. Flannel shirts and polyester stretch pants as far as the eye could see. There might have been a BushI supporter there. If there was, I'm sure they left as soon as one of the Robertson faction got a rope. I hung out, trembling in the corner, wearing a small Kemp sticker on my shirt and trying to look confident. The party had sent along a platform for us to vote on. And indiividuals came with their own resolutions. Democracy is messy, but I wasn't prepared for resolutions reestablishing the pledge of allegiance in the classroom, abolishing public schools, outlawing Godless communism. With each resolution, I voted no. Everyone else voted yes. Suspicious looks, my family edging away from me in case there was a stoning. Then after lots of haggling and "speeches," the vote came and Robertson won by a landslide. As we were milling around afterward, one of Jack Kemp's daughters came up to me. She was there and was apparently looking for any signs of life in the Kemp campaign. My best friend said "She thinks you're cute." But my mind was wandering; I was thinking of launching a sex-based initiative with the hot young man over there. I left the caucuses with a bad taste in my mouth. Discussion is democratic; but voting in public isn't. But then, it's not about democracy. It's political theater; it seems delightfully quaint but is really a tool that gets you a lot of attention and brings a windfall of hundreds of millions of dollars to the state. And we're told the caucuses play a vital role in picking the next President. They've acquired that oversized importance because no one in either party has had the balls to stand up and put a stop to it. And by that, I mean not just the Iowa Caucuses but the entire mess of primaries and caucuses that we call the Presidential Campaign. We can certainly find a better system for whittling down the number of choices, can't we?
It was a glorious night. We joined another couple for our evening out, the gala re-opening of Hill Auditorium in Ann Arbor, after $38 million and close to 2 years of renovations. We enjoyed a long, leisurely dinner and arrived just a few minutes before the festivities were to begin. The auditorium is a marvel. A few days back, the urlLink New York Times called it a midwestern Carnegie Hall. In it's 90 year history, it's played host to nearly every great performer of the century. The hall's new color scheme is true to the original. For years, it was an egg-shell color. But the newly restored colors recreate what University of Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman called the inside of a Faberge egg. The acoustics are still perfect. And last night's concert was grand. Countertenor David Daniels, Chanticleer, Midori, the home-grown symphony and chorus, and the urlLink Canadian soprano Measha Brueggergosman , who was dazzling. Audra McDonald was ill and unable to be at the performance, and so Measha came back to the stage to perform a selection of cabaret songs by William Bolcolm-- her favorites, she said-- accompanied by the composer himself, who lives here. She was amazing, a musicality, range, depth and maturity and an outsize personality and sense of humor that won everyone over. M and I plan to go see her in Toronto this year. Having grown up in a family that was lower middle class, we didn't go to those kinds of concerts and even if we had wanted to, we couldn't have afforded the tickets. I listened to symphonic and choral music on the radio and bought CD's. For a variety of reasons, including a busy lifestyle, it remains the primary way I enjoy that music. But last night, at that concert more than any other, I realized what I miss about a live performance. During the Vaughan Williams Serenade to Music that closed the concert, I was lost to the beauty of the piece and I thought back to all the other times I'd heard it... on the radio or on what I think is the urlLink classic recording by the LSO and Sir Adrian Boult . Last night was the first time I'd seen it performed, and I was so moved to see such beautiful sounds coming from real human voices and hands holding instruments. What an odd moment! And yet, it's easy to forget that when you rarely go to a live concert, or when most of the other music that you hear every days was created on software designed to sound like this. Wrapped in the music, this will be a night long remembered. -----
I plan to keep today's post short. I'm catching up on reading today... portions of books, a week's worth of handwringing over former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, updates from Iowa where the polls show a significant Dean slippage, Foreign Affairs, etc. I'll throw in an episode of Charlie Rose and urlLink Juan Cole was on Newshour with Jim Lehrer last night. Cole is brilliant. I'll pull it up on Replay. I'm also writing a little piece on the Iowa Caucuses. We'll call it an appreciation. Watch for it here on Monday. I might break my rule on lower carb eating and have a big breakfast this morning, one of those frittatas that's as big as your head. I'll go easy on the hash browns. On the other hand, I might stick to my 2 eggs/cottage cheese breakfast at home because tonight is going to be big. urlLink Hill Auditorium is re-opening after a giant renovation. Caruso called it acoustically perfect in his day and it's truly a marvel. So tonight is historic and the social event of the season for Ann Arborites-- the equivalent of Carnegie Hall, I suppose. My best friend is going with, and we've already had at least one Queer Eye conversation. Others to follow. And let's begin with dinner at one of the city's urlLink newest restaurants , where we'll spill an absurd amount of money dining with another couple joining us for the concert. I love this, can't you tell? But I love another kind of existence, too... hanging out last night at the cafe for 4 hours shooting the shit with the regulars, unshaven, dressed in a grungy A muscle shirt and jeans, drinking coffee, sharing stories, laughing. Talk about cheap, great fun. I walked across the street from the loft with a pile of magazines and books and after 4 hours didn't touch one of them. What a cool way to start the weekend.
I am from Iowa. I participated in the caucuses when I lived there. Howard Dean was right. The caucuses are hyper-overblown, undemocratic, an example of what is wrong with American politics - not a delightful gathering in homes where partisans try to lure the undecided to their candidate with cookies. Oh wait a minute, that has happened.
I just watched the Sundance airing of the documentary "Paul Monette: The Brink of Summer's End." It ran earlier this month and if you haven't seen it , I highly recommend looking for it the next time it comes around on Sundance. (Who's our favorite urlLink Sundance kid ?) I believe I saw some of this documentary a couple years ago and I'm not even sure I watched the whole thing at the time. This time, it was riveting. It's funny that something you barely took the time to acknowledge just a short while back takes on great importance with the passage of time. I think to some extent, I wasn't ready to face the images of someone dying from AIDS, even someone who held on as long as Monette did. This time, engaged in the multitasking which plagues me, I set everything aside and watched, not turning away from Monette's deterioration. To my knowledge, there are no photographs of my uncle in the days and weeks before he succumbed to AIDS in 1992. So as I watched Monette wither and those bright eyes go blind, I thought of my uncle and the end of his life that my family so carefully shielded us from. Also with time, I've felt a growing desire to understand gay experience. Yes, I'm experiencing it myself, but how did Monette experience it? How did men live in the urlLink Gay New York of the early 20th century? What about the lives of the great gay and lesbian writers of modern times? What about the lives of Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson, Henry Cowell, David Diamond, John Cage and Ned Rorem and other great American composers whose works fill my CD library? How did those gay men live in their times? What compromises did they make and what victories did they enjoy? Gay history is a hidden history but it's not been entirely lost. Authors like urlLink John Boswell , urlLink James McCourt , urlLink George Chauncey and others had unearthed all kinds of gay histories, largely the stories of ordinary people. Their work shows up the simplistic view of Oppression-Stonewall-Liberation that is our popular narrative. I guess I bring this up because, after seeing the Monette documentary, I can't help but think of the histories that were wiped out when AIDS obliterated one or two generations of gay men. urlLink Neil Bartlett writes that homosexuals are flowers. "They blossom in the form of works of art." Before I was even aware of who I am, AIDS killed thousands of men who could have shown me through their art and lives. Of course, the works they did create before disease took them are still with us. Paul Monette's urlLink greatest work came after the virus had already started dismantling his body's defenses. He received the gift of time before AIDS took him... and he presented that gift to us and readers yet to come.
I could almost get used to all this extra sleep I'm getting. I'm averaging 7 hours a night this week. How about that, kids? I won't tell you what's not getting done because I'm going to bed early -- and no, I'm not talking about masturbation or sex. But thanks for the concern. I haven't read one newspaper since Monday, so obviously, I'll need to shift other activities around to accomodate this "intrusion" of sleep into my schedule. M and I met up after class last night for dinner and drinks and dish. Not necessarily in that order. I presented him with the "couple comprised of three" concept that I wrote about here this week. We agreed that in principle it's a cool idea. But as I wrote here the other day, it's hard enough to find one guy who's a good match for a boyfriend-- much less two. It didn't stop us from having fun with the thought experiment, constructing the ideal "family" with people and webloggers we know. urlLink You were on the list, so you better pack up and move out here now. By the way, every time I write about anything like this, I get email from people accusing me of a complete lack of moral standards, of engaging in "horrifying" threesomes, of being the "stereotypical gay man." I got two more of those emails this week. Here's the deal, readers: I will talk about whatever the fuck I want to talk about. I've been nice, I've tried to be reasonable in replies to those emails, but I've had enough. This weblog is about things I want to talk about. If I want to talk about the leather community, abortion, fisting, threesomes, or anything else some individuals may find distasteful... I can. You are free to read it or not and you are free to agree or disagree. But don't berate me for writing about a topic and don't assume that my writing about a topic is my endorsement of it. In short, let's be intelligent adults. The shift in my schedule this week-- extra sleep and the extra reading time required for class-- has left me feeling dangerously uninformed. Like most of us, I hear NPR in the morning, so it's not like I'm unaware there's a Mars Rover, or that I mistakenly believe it's actually Karl Rove on Mars (although I wouldn't mind that.) But the newspapers are what I've missed reading this week. I know that newspapers aren't complete, that important stories fall through the cracks either because of other bigger stories, or ignorance, negligence, conspiracy. But I love the general feeling of "knowing" that I get when I finish a newspaper and lay it down. I don't get that from the radio, TV, or even online. And maybe that's the old fashioned part of me. Oddly enough, I'm not holding the paper. I'm reading a electronic copy of it. But there's still an old fashioned feeling about seeing the page and the fonts and type sizes and the little stories stuffed in the corners. Reading on the web isn't the same. Everyone should go see "The Fog of War." I think I wrote about it here before. It's not made it to Detroit/Ann Arbor yet, which is unusual. It won't be here till next weekend, and only for 3 days so it looks like I'll see that one in DC. That, and "The Battle of Algiers," which is showing at the new urlLink Landmark E St Cinema . Any DC readers been there yet?
We're expecting snow today, the second snow event of the winter season. Since I've already written about the urlLink first one , I won't ramble on. It will be 5-7 inches of snow where I live, which is a moderate amount. It was expected to start sometime overnight, but that hasn't happened. And now, this morning's forecast says "snow today." Apparently, forecasting is becoming less like prediction and more like a Homeland Security terror alert, which boils down to "something might happen or maybe it won't." The risk of snow is "Elevated" and later today it might be "High." The risk of me not finishing the reading for my class today is "High" unless I get busy. There's a trip to Washington booked for next week. I'm looking forward to it, since the last time I was there was way back in July. I miss DC. A lot. Perhaps it's more correct to say I miss a city. Not any big city. Let's put it this way: I miss living in a northeastern city that is a center of power. That whittles it down to New York City and Washington. I wrote a couple years ago here that I felt my time in this reasonably-sized, relatively cultured midwestern college town was about up and as time goes on, I feel it more than ever. I'm not sure why I feel this way, except that I've always wanted to be near the center of things. So like a Leo, right? Whatever. I want to be near decisionmakers, policymakers, opinion leaders... people who are doing things that have a wide-ranging impact on other people's lives. Now, you can find people like that everywhere, but in a bigger city like DC, the sheer number is overwhelming compared to Muncie, Indiana, for instance. hmmm... this isn't going the way I want it to. I'm finding it hard to explain why it is that I feel drawn to a city like DC. Let me try it this way: painting a picture of the kind of life I'd like to live, something we all do quite often. Here's my "American dream:" A high profile media job in Washington, DC; a condo in a cool townhouse on the northern edge of the Dupont Circle neighborhood, with the subway close by, the grocery store a few blocks down the street, no car... oh, and of course, a puppy. The thing about that dream is that it's not impossible. I'm not trying to become an astronaut or a world-famous surgeon. What I want is generally attainable. But what I think I've done for a long time is think about the dream without taking much action to see how that might be possible. I've also been slow to act because I'm generally happy with life as it is. To the extent that I can, I've created my own little urban oasis in my own city with a loft downtown, across the street from a cafe, bakeshop, jazz club, general store around the corner, bus stop in front of my window. But all the pieces aren't in place. For instance, more people. Kind of hard to make that up. And power, the intangible. I want to be closer to people who are writing and thinking important things and while there are some out here, there are more there . I think the gay part of me (and that's a large part) reaches out to the city, too. I want to be around more people like me and more who aren't like me at all. The Gay Ghetto beckons, not because I plan to take part in some poor sap's stereotypical nightmare of Gay Life-- too many circuit parties, too many drugs, too much sex, too much shallowness-- but because I am an urban being. I will never live in a quiet suburb away from downtown where there are no sidewalks. I'll never own a ranch-style home. I'd rather not own a car anymore. I don't even really want a summer home in the Hamptons or a time share in Rehoboth. I want a condo in a cool Washington neighborhood. Some people dream like this and then use it as fodder for depression about why they're not there. I don't. In fact, dreaming my desired future in this way not only helps me decide what I want to strive for; it also helps me discover the kind of person I am. Which is probably why writing about these thoughts always comes across as flat. This little essay seems merely aspirational to a reader; perhaps absurd. That's my fault. I've run out of words to describe the essence of myself and the person I want to become.
He's a ghost from my past. We broke up a year ago... ended all ties in June. And now he's back. Yesterday, I stopped at the bar to grab a bite to eat between classes and there he was, in the corner, having a drink with a friend. It's alright. We share many of the same friends and hangouts. We're thrown together often, for events and when we socialize in public. All is perfectly civil, if quite chilly. I slipped into a seat at the opposite end of the restaurant. A couple minutes later, he slid in next to me to say a word about his seven year old son. Whenever I hear his name, the sun comes out from behind the clouds. The boy asks about me, wonders where I am. What to say? I feel like we're a divorce case or something. Well, this is probably the way it is when there's a breakup involving a child. Would I want to hang out with the kid sometime soon... see a movie? You bet your ass. "Then why don't we get together to talk about that this week," he said. Fuck. Do I have to go through one to get to the other? I don't feel guilty or even a little bad for what happened last year. I've already written here that only two things bother me: that I had to end a friendship as well as a relationship; and that I was so naive and stupid as to have entered that doomed-from-the-beginning relationship in the first place. Last summer, I walked out out of the room and closed the door on all that shit. The room is quiet now. Inside, one's eyes grow accustomed to the gloom. Sheets cover all the furniture; the conceit being that it must be protected so it can be used again. All is quiet. But there are ghosts... of myself, my ex-boyfriend, our life together, his son. Am I ready to open the door and began the inventory of what's inside? It's not a question of going back to the relationship. I tried that before. But the question has always been whether the broken friendship could be mended. I've always said yes, in time. Is it time? There's another alternative - hashing it out in stages, allowing friendship to return slowly. Is now the right time for that? I'm not entirely sure.
I rarely have trouble sleeping. In recent years, I've carefully crafted a strategy of depriving myself of sleep at every turn. I've discovered that regularly sleeping 2-3 hours a night does wonders for insomnia. Now, the problem is that I'm getting more sleep. A good 8-10 hours a night over the weekend, for instance, does weird things to me on Sunday night. I had to be up late last night to do some freelance work from 11:30pm-1:30am. I thought about a nap in the evening, but I wasn't tired enough to drift off. So I stayed up, finished my work by 1:45am and came home to bed. But sleep didn't come home to me. I closed my eyes, opened them, shifted around, opened the lapper and read a few weblogs (noting urlLink CoolRelax's return, btw), watched a little Internet porno movie, which wasn't hot but apparently was hot enough for the lapper's nearly depleted battery, closed the laptop, lay back in bed and waited for sleep. By 3:30am, I was a little disgusted since I now had a grand total of one hour available to me before I needed to get up. But every time I closed my eyes, I could feel sleep encroaching, but my brain wouldn't calm down. Finally, I drifted off to sleep sometime around 4am, only to be awakened by the alarm at 4:40am. Well, that was restful. The thing is, I'm not tired. I feel fine. I'm at work, in a reasonably productive state. I think that as I've been increasing my sleep to an average of 6 hours a night, my body has been in this weird transitional state. It craves the additional sleep and I feel much better. But it's also accustomed to operating on far less, so after a weekend of particularly good sleep, it assumes it's had all it's going to get. Who knows? Spending a lot of time trying to understand the rich depths of my brain seems like a fool's errand. Oh, so here's what I thought about while I was laying (lying?) awake. Why date just one guy? Why not be in a relationship with two? urlLink Redpoy has something similar to that. I have another friend who has done that. Has anyone else tried that kind of a relationship? I'm not talking about a couple that has threesomes. I'm talking about 3 guys romantically and sexually involved with each other-- perhaps "monogamously," perhaps not. There aren't many, I'm sure. It's hard enough to find one guy you like and can get along with, much less a third guy that both of you like and can get along with. But it does happen. I'm intrigued, not merely because of the sexy fun which ensues (although Redpoy and company are urlLink hot ), but how it changes the dynamic of a relationship. Maybe it was the ramblings of a sleep-deprived mind, but I like this idea even though I may not commence a search anytime soon for a Couple Plus One. However, if urlLink you ever move to Ann Arbor, look us up. I know the root of this idea of mine. I went to the urlLink bar for dinner last night and had a long conversation with my good friend, T, who was holding court when I arrived. He and I talk a lot about relationships and last night he reflected on his, I on mine. We talked about what it is we're after in pursuing a relationship. Is it marriage or its equivalent? A long-term monogamous relationship? It's what my parents and millions of their generation have done, and it's the most readily available template for a relationship that I have. But is it what I want? Do I embrace the majority model and show heterosexual society that I'm normal just like them and all I want is a happy, married life just like them? Or do I embrace the "strangeness" of being gay? Is the love that two men have for each other fundamentally different from the love of a man and a woman? Sometimes, I find myself wanting a gay version of the traditional happy life of married monogamy. Other times, I feel that life isn't that simple, even for the heteros among us. And while traditional model has many benefits and is appropriate for many, what about me? I've kind of lost interest in discussing whether or not monogamy is a good thing. What interests me more is the other ways in which gay relationships don't have to be traditional. Thinking about all of this could keep me up many more nights, methinks.
OK so I didn't get around to "The Magic Mountain" last night. I plan to tonight. My friend and I dropped by the bar for some pal time on Friday night. We started out with rum and ciders and then, feeling all warm inside, asked for the "Bartender's Surprise." Erin cooked up a potent but smooth mix of vodka and pineapple juice and one or two other ingredients that I would have remembered if I hadn't gotten so buzzed from consuming said drink. It was a California Long Island, I think. At 36, I need a really good reason to get drunk anymore, so it was a light buzz . But I was feeling good as we sailed out of the bar and I returned to the loft. I may not have read a book last night but I still had a particular kind of Friday night that I haven't enjoyed in a long time. I caught up on the papers at the cafe next door, then around 10pm I returned to the loft and watched TV-- everything from the Mummy Documentary of the Week on Discovery Times to part of Halloween 5 on AMC. By the time I sank naked underneath the cool sheets, I remembered why I enjoyed those kinds of Fridays so rarely now: I used to endure and dread them all the time years ago before I was out of the closet, before there was an Internet, before there were more than 30 cable channels. Ten years of abundant friends, dates, boyfriends, multichannel entertainment, online hookups, etc have reshaped my once uncomplicated life. But it's nice to go back every once in a while. Saturday dawned, but I put off my entry onto the stage until about 10am. Light workout, shower postponed until 2pm. On the relaxation scale, this weekend is a 10. I started into "The End of Evil" by David Frum and Richard Perle today. I don't intend to read the whole thing but it arrived on Monday and all week I've been hearing a string a rather poorly conducted interviews with both guys on NPR and elsewhere. I just watched the Charlie Rose interview today and it was the best of the bunch, by far. Perhaps because Charlie kept the Perle to Frum ratio about 3 to 1. David got hardly any face time which kept the conversation on a relatively high level. My personal foreign policy, as if anyone cares besides me, has a hefty dose of realism. But I don't the see the world as they do and even at this early stage in their book, that's becoming clear to me. It's not only a difference about how and when to project American power; its simply not seeing the world in as dark a hue as them. That sounds funny, I know. The world is a dark place, with terrorism a part of the "new" reality, post 9/11. But the fact is, that the more I read them, the more I'm annoyed at their obsession with the presence of this "evil" in the world, which they seem to define widely to include anything at odds with American interests. I just don't think it's that stark. Now, Saturday night at 8pm, there will be no clubbing, no hanging with friends, nothing tonight except for me and my book and my vanila soy latte.
The weekend is here and like every other one, there will be a Friday night, a Saturday and a Sunday. But for the first time in probably 2 years, it's going to be different. It's going to be quiet. Without intrusions of events, circumstances, contigencies, occasions. It's going to be me. Friends and boyfriends... parties and movies... are all great. I enjoy them and need them. But for me at least, there's something almost primal about a weekend without commitments. It's not as though I've had something every single week for two years. It's hard to explain, but this is the first weekend in two years where I won't feel a weight on my shoulders. What does that mean? I don't know. A burden, an unresolved issue-- the elephant in the room that I must deal with at some point but for now I'll try to ignore. The elephants are gone I guess. So what will I do? Tonight, I'm going to read a book at the cafe. I haven't read a long work of fiction since I finished my multi-year project to read Proust in 2003. In fact, I don't think I've read any fiction since then. And so I'll pick up Thomas Mann's urlLink The Magic Mountain , a gift to me from a good friend last summer. Handing me the book as a birthday gift, the friend said I'd like the words and the expansive ideas Mann explores. I'd revel in contemplation, just as I did reading Proust's words, composed in his bedroom a century ago. And so I hope I will. Being the uber (dot-dot) Type A literalist individual that I am, I concentrate all of my reading time on facts-- The Washington Post, The New York Times, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, The New Republic and on and on. I can't read fiction and truly enjoy it unless my heart and mind are in the right place. After a few months of effort, there's now at least a measure of calm surrounding me. And so, if all goes well, I'll take my thick Mann paperback to the cafe and immerse myself in another world of ideas.
Um... I hardly know what to say after reading that Madonna is endorsing Wesley Clark. I saw it on urlLink Waremouse's weblog a few minutes ago and then found the boilerplate email from the campaign in my inbox. I get leery when celebrities make endorsements. But it's mainly because they often make ridiculous endorsements-- promoting Yahoo Serious for President; or they promote a perfectly legitimate environmental cause, but their stand on the issue is so wacky that they do more harm than good. In the email from the Clark campaign, she, or someone, writes "The simple truth is that the current administration has squandered incredible opportunities to bring the world together, to promote peace in regions that have only known war, to encourage health in places that are ravaged with disease, to make us more secure by living up to our principles at home and abroad. The simple truth is that the policies of our current administration do not reflect what is great about America." Not too bad. It may not be worth all that much, but what the hell? I'm sure there's a "Madonna Fans For Clark" Meet-Up group somewhere that's excited about this. It goes along with some recent good news in the polls for the Clark campaign. The Kerry Campaign, in search of a pulse these days, should go after Beyonce.
I meant to post more yesterday... another best intention. But then there was work and the gym and the first day of class and then me and my friend Matt grabbed some dinner and bitched and gossiped. Ahhh... it's so nice to have him back. He and his boyfriend were in SoCal for a week, celebrating New Year's and watching Michigan get creamed in the Rose Bowl. (I saved the $450 ticket and watched the shellacking at home.) So both of us had saved up a good deal of bitching and gossiping that we spewed almost continuously throughout dinner. I'm surprised we managed to eat. No loss, the food wasn't that good. We had gone to an Italian restaurant I hadn't been to in about 2 years, maybe 3. But Food Network did a little piece on it Monday and I thought it was worth a second try. Turns out, I had forgotten how annoying the tomato sauce is. Very acidic, with a taste that's paper thin as it passes over the tongue. I added some sugar and that cut it a little. But it was a wholly disappointing experience. Especially since my friend Chris has spoiled me forever with a beautifully crafted sauce with a perfect balance of acidic and sweet notes, with the zestiness of red wine. He's worked on it for a long time, and the sauce literally leaps across your palate. I won't even compare his gnocchi to the bland restaurant version. Oh well... $20 a plate with appetizer, wine. Not a big loss. Just a huge disappointment. OK... several of you have written asking about the syllabus for the Contemporary Gay Male Fiction class I mentioned yesterday. The semester looks really good. We'll read the following books, and as you can see, they're not all contemporary: urlLink Who Was That Man? A Present for Mr. Oscar Wilde by Neil Bartlett urlLink Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes by Tony Kushner urlLink The Swimming Pool Library by Alan Hollinghurst urlLink Edward the Second by Christopher Marlowe urlLink At Swim, Two Boys by Jamie O'Neill Slow Water by Annamarie Jagose urlLink Mr. Clive and Mr. Page by Neil Bartlett urlLink American Studies by Mark Merlis urlLink Memoirs of Hadrian by Marguerite Yourcenar urlLink As Meat Loves Salt by Maria McCann Interesting selection, huh? We have a movie night each week, as well. Here's the video list for the semester: The Dead Boy's Club urlLink The Watermelon Woman urlLink Before Stonewall urlLink Looking for Langston urlLink Voices from the Front urlLink Edward II urlLink The Einstein of Sex urlLink Maurice urlLink Head On urlLink Satyricon (yes, Fellini!) Poison urlLink Rope (yes, Hitchcock!) urlLink Swoon urlLink Lilies urlLink If... I'm excited!
I'm going to audit another class this semester. Frequent readers of this weblog (the unemployed) remember that last semester I audited the now infamous "How To Be Gay" course at the University of Michigan, which was a great exploration of gay identification and gay identity-- how gay men have appropriated elements of hetero culture for themselves. The class was a success, enjoyable, thought-provoking... well worth the effort. So this semester, I'm going to take the professor's course exploring contemporary gay male fiction. If nothing else, it will be a good chance to brush up on my weak gay fiction background. But past experience tells me the class will be better than that. I'm looking forward to it! I'll talk more about the syllabus later today. Off to work and then the gym and class. I'll put more on your screen later.
When the predicted snowstorm doesn't come, do people take all that milk and bread back to the store? The weather screamers on TV and the more calm forecasts from the weather service predicted heavy snowfall for my part of the world Saturday night into Sunday. The predicted amounts rose to as much as 12 inches expected by Sunday afternoon. There was a thrill in the air on Saturday... the first big snowfall of the season! The first big storm, the first opportunity to shut oneself inside with hot cocoa, a few DVD's, a good book, a warm fire... oh and a window because you'd want to be inside all warm and cozy looking out into the swirl of white. The standard trips to the store followed. You'd think we were about to experience a new Ice Age, or do people really consume that much bread and milk?? Like, together? Whatever. So we're all ready for the snow. Bring on the snow. We went to eat at an Ethiopean restaurant, knowing that by the time we finished, it would be snowing. Dinner done, no snow. Home, to check the forecast. The channel 7 meteorologist is practically incoherent, on his knees, babbling through tears about the oncoming snow. Over on channel 4, the reporter is demonstrating how to slit your wrists should the storm be too much to handle. On channel 2, a reporter stands beside the freeway, showing how difficult it was for cars to drive safely through the no-show snow. Off to bed. Sunday morning, I slept in till 11am. When there's a civilization-ending blizzard, you're allowed to ignore the alarm clock. I got up and open the curtains. Hmmm.... no snow on the deck. Not one flake. A check of the forecast revealed a much lower snow expectation, 5-7 inches. And when was it expected? Soon. The weather service said "this afternoon and tonight." And sure enough, around 3pm a light snow began to fall. At last!! I thought about having a large meal of bread and milk, but I don't like milk and I'm watching my carbs so I grabbed my computer and bookbag and zipped across the street to the cafe to get a latte and read the newspapers. For a while, the snow looked like it was going to live up to expectations. Visibility dropped, the snow swirled in the wind, my cellphone started beeping with text messages about traffic accidents. Then, around 7pm, the snow tapered off. Union mandated break? Not sure. I got up early the next morning and was greeted by a grand total of 2 inches of snow. Now this wasn't counting drifts. The drifts in the corner of my deck topped 3 inches. People don't seem to be too pissed about the forecasting mistake. In fact, I think the only thing that gets people really mad is underpredicting snow. But what struck me as strange was everybody sticking to the forecast, even as the storm dematerialized around us. It was devotion to a truth equalled only by a group of supply-siders.
urlLink Waremouse , that smart and sexy thing, had a few and then grabbed the mic at Green Lantern urlLink last night . He reports singing a timeless classic. There were few, if any, casualties. Speaking of the Green Latrine, my friend Chris has long been formulating a plan to visit each of DC's skankiest gay bars once. The list includes Green Lantern, Mr. P's, Fireplace and one or two others. The problem is, I've already been to each one of those bars. Once. Does this make me skanky? Perhaps partially skanky. But we all need a little skank in our lives, right?
You know when it's working, and you know when it isn't. That's what my friends say when we talk about dating. It's a gut feeling that bears out when you consider all the hard data. It's the essence of one's thoughts about compatibility in bed, similarities in outlook on life, educations, likes and dislikes, tastes in music and books, political outlook, and the list goes on. In no relationship do all of these factors come together perfectly. Is there a tipping point, where so many of them have to coalesce? Or is there less a certain number that you must rack up, and more a set of particular pieces that must be in the puzzle? I like this analogy: if you build a little house out of wooden blocks, what are the pieces you can't remove without the whole thing tumbling in? That's the way it would be with an already developed relationship. If pieces started dropping out, sooner or later a pivotal piece would give way and bring the whole thing down. If any of the pivotal pieces aren't there as a relationship is just beginning, then nothing substantial gets built. What are the pivotal pieces? Or do you even get this far as you evaluate your own situation? Does the gut feeling count for all? A friend of mine has a gut feeling about where his relationship is going. And as I hear him talk... things don't sound good.
As I get older, if there's any kind of hangover that I still experience, it's called The Return to Work After Vacation. I'm lethargic, cranky, chained to my desk not so much by my workload but because of my lack of interest in getting up to see if anyone else has work for me. I could take a Motrin to calm the pangs of ennui (hmm... pangs of ennui) but I'd rather just walk out the door. It's hardest when New Year's falls on a Thursday. I don't take the next day off even though every time it rolls around, I think afterward that I should have done just that. My workday is actually half over, even though most people are just beginning at this moment, and that makes my complaining twice as annoying, I think. This holiday vacation was less satisfying than most. This "wintery mix" of cold/chills/sore throat etc didn't keep me in bed the whole time but I took these really long 4-6 hour naps during many of the days, which has a way of blowing giant holes in plans for friends or even just uninterrupted reading. Having said that, I did get some extra reading done and the bf and I spent some extra time together Monday. And I still got my gym time in. I'm probably going to DC for an extended weekend in late January. It's time to spend a few days with Chris and his boyfriend and other friends, see the city and read books and stuff. I think this is going to be a trip without the boyfriend. This is often a touchy subject with couples. I think my boyfriend will get along with it. Frankly, he'll have to. I'm such a bitch! I don't mean to come off that way. We talked about the idea in principle back when we first started dating and he seemed amenable to it at the time. I think this trip will be the first time to put it into practice. I don't expect much of a fuss. Plus, I'll be the good boyfriend and suggest trip together at the same time-- probably to Toronto or Chicago. Relationships don't have to be like America's relations with North Korea. And mine isn't. But I move carefully sometimes to protect the bf's feelings, since he's more of the "I'm happiest only when I'm with you" kinds of people. I'm more of the bastard of the two of us.
We drank a bottle of champagne last night. Slowly. But still not slow enough to prevent the onslaught of the headache from hell a few minutes into '04. But the perversity of it all. I couldn't sleep for nearly 2 hours afterward. CBC was showing Dogma, so I watched a big chunk of the movie before calling it a night. I'd forgotten how fun it was. Motrin has been my drug of choice the past month or so in fighting the golfer's elbow that plagues my left arm. And it came in handy with the headache. Then, I wake up this morning with a sore throat that morphs its way into a fever that lasts most of the day even as I try to sleep it off. What the fuck? When will all this shit let up? I've had it easier than many blogger friends, huddled in blankets with cups of TheraFlu, their holidays thoroughly marred if not ruined. I've just been inconvenienced. Speaking of marred, if not ruined, I'm watching the Rose Bowl. But as the SoCal score rises and Michigan falls further behind, I find I'm looking away more often. I go Hot Body Shopping on BigMuscle. I'll have those pecs, those abs, those shoulders, that ass, that dick, and that pair of smoldering eyes. I can't change my eyes or dick. Easily. But I can resolve to make other changes. Not that I'm a big fan of resolutions. In fact, I didn't make resolutions until 1998 on an earlier version of this weblog. I can't remember what they were. Uh oh... is that a good thing? When I brought up the subject of resolutions last night at dinner, my boyfriend, Mr. Self Help, said "I don't make resolutions." And launched into an explanation about the general futility of it all, while me eyes glazed over. But I'm used to this. When he finished, I said, "Uh huh. I'm resolving to send holiday cards next year." He smiled, knowing he lost this round of our back-and-forth, giving each other shit routine. I do subscribe to the notion that a lot of our resolution-making might be a meaningless exercise. Every January, I watch good intentioned souls younger than me with flab and love handles line up at the gym to buy their membership. I know they'll crowd the weights for a month and then disappear, only to return in a year. Or not. I feel bad because I'm sure they feel bad. Speaking of defeats, I resolved last year to read an extra book a month. Didn't happen, to say the least. But it's not all about failure. I wanted to put on about 15 pounds of muscle last year, and I did. I think I made one of those vague resolutions about taking greater control of my life and free time, or some such mush. But, looking back, I think I succeeded. I explored more of life, met some cool guys, had some great sex, began feeding my long and latent interest in foreign policy. Alright, enough of the review. What do I want to do this year? Can my small-boned 5'9" frame support another 5-10 pounds of lean and defined muscle without looking too big? I'd like to find out. Here we go again: one extra book read every month for pleasure. More consistent and complete reading of the Post and the Times every day. I want to host something regularly on national television. I'm going to get a dog by the end of the year. That's enough. Five resolutions is plenty. Given my record, it might be three too many. Oh yeah, and that one about the holiday cards. That counts, too.
... as it arrives here in the eastern time zone, best to all of you!!
It's Sunday, it's Leap... um, Day... or Sunday. Well, whatever. Try not to wet your pants while watching this spoof of the urlLink State of the Union Address from our own heel of a President, George W. Bush.
What a wondrous world we live in. At 1pm today, I was standing in the sunlight on Church Street in Toronto and at 6pm, I'm back home at my favorite Chinese restaurant ordering Yu-shan Eggplant. I had a good time with my est-crazed housemates at the B in Toronto. I basically accomplished this by staying away from them. At breakfast the first day, one of them politely asked what I did and after I tried as best I could to explain the position that I occupy, I got looks which indicated that at least two of them thought I might be a terrorist. Or perhaps just a traitor. They weren't rubes in from Saskatoon, but they all had an uncosmopolitan feel to them. I decided not to engage them on the subject of gay marriage. I was congenial but I had little contact with them, since they spent all day and much of the evening at sessions, drinking the kool-aid. I, on the other hand, roamed through the Greek community, and I don't mean the bathhouses. I drank a lot of coffee, read a big chunk of the big book I took with me, added a henley type shirt to my Roots clothing collection, and nearly bought a new pair of Skechers, but decided not to at the last minute. I didn't go clubbing this time. There didn't seem to be any point to it, since I was alone and I'm not great at turning what looks like desperation to my advantage. I did see "The Fog of War" a second time, and was more enthralled (if that's possible) the second time than the first. I think it's a remarkable documentary and I hope it does well at the Oscars tonight even though I have no intention of watching them. I've checked and I will be the only person on the planet not watching the Oscars, with the exception of some people in Haiti and Mr. and Mrs. Henry Clamtramp in Dismal Seepage, Missouri, who will be watching a rented copy of "Yentl."
The other 6 residents at the B this weekend are here for an est seminar, "The Landmark Forum." So I spent 30 minutes at breakfast making small talk with people looking to "pop" this weekend... etc. It's hard to make small talk when what you think they're discussing is a load of shit. But then, I might be too cynical. I've certainly been accused of that before. My big book for the weekend is still largely unread but it's just the beginning of the weekend, right? :) I can see this idea of going somewhere else to get work done might not pan out. Oh, except that I did go somewhere else to spend the weekend, so that is an accomplishment in and of itself, even if nothing else gets taken care of. My pal Gavin emailed and he's in town this weekend, so I might have breakfast with him on Sunday morning before my flight back.
Dinner at 7 West and now over to have a cup of coffee and read for a while. Fog of War is showing at 9:30pm and although I've already been to see it once back home, I might just go see it again because sometimes when you're away from regular life you're able to concentrate better and watching a movie like that when you have more free brain cells to devote to it is a good thing. Linda, the woman who runs the bed breakfast where I'm staying, seems nice enough. I'm staying in a room called "Sun" something or "Queen" something. I'm not sure of the title she's given to it, but it's a bright yellow color that will wake the dead. I feel like I'm staying in someone's daughter's room... carefully preserved even though their beloved daughter left years ago for college and then got married, and years later, she returns home to see her mom and goes upstairs and opens the door and looks at the room, rolling her eyes that her mom has kept everything the same and then she closes the door again and goes back downstairs to chide her mother for creating a shrine. The room is more than adequate and even though there is no TV, I can get along without the channel-flipping which is my regular habit at hotels. A total waste of time. Ideally, this means I should make more than the expected rate of progress in the book I've brought with me. This is a theory which I plan to test carefully this weekend.
A long annoying conversation with my friend Mark, which ended mercifully when my cell battery was almost dead and he needed to get on the Metro. Mark has the ability to argue endlessly against a point of view and then next day, adopt that point of view and then seem almost surprised that you noticed. Today for the first time, he recognized that I noticed and I almost wanted to drive home the point and say thank you but decided against it. In the past week, I've become a major advocate for him and Joe getting back together. The nasty part of me thinks they're made for each other, with their endless, roundabout arguments that regularly devolve into minute discussions of word-choice. The other reason is more above-board: a part of Mark doesn't want to end that relationship. Tuesday I told him I thought this was the case and Joe's idea of going to a counselor was a good one that might help them get back together. He was exceedingly pissed and the next day, offered a litany reasons why I was wrong and why there was no question in his mind that they had to break up. I wasn't buying it. And now, here we are, a day after the first counseling session and now at last he admits that the uncertainty exists in his mind and he needs to proceed with living by himself but he needs to work on giving Joe a chance. What bothers me is his lack of honesty about how he's feeling... not only with me but also with Joe. It does no one any good, and yet he persists in this pattern of saying 2-3 different things depending on when you talk to him. Now, I don't think this is an intrinsic dishonesty on his part. I think he's under a great deal of stress and his brain is a big mess right now. The problem is, he's trying to make pronouncements to one and all about where he is with all of this, when this is the time to be quiet with the rest of us and devote his time to introspection and lots of conversation with Joe-- ideally, with a professional counselor there, too. Cutting myself off from the idea of dating him isn't that hard. I hadn't considered it a possibility in the short-term anyway. Plus, the past couple weeks watching him flail around has left me profoundly annoyed with him and unwilling to take anything he says at face value. The hard part for me is this: he and I are very close and I think I need to step away from the mess - far away from it - so as not to influence him, especially because I think both Mark and Joe actually want to work out their differences and reforge some kind of relationship.
There's been a lot of anger unleashed on President Bush in the past few days over his decision to support an amendment banning gay marriage. Of course, we shouldn't be surprised that he would do such a thing. He would avoid it if he could, but faced with re-election prospects that are shaky, it's a perfect issue to shore up the conservative base. This is how Bush and Karl Rove have maneuvered from the very beginning. The country is so polarized right now that a small number of states and a very small number of constituencies could make the difference in November. So, throughout the Bush administration, we've seen Bush throw crumbs to states and constituencies that he feels he must win. Gay marriage is one of the latest, but there's also last night's decision to keep US pleasure boats out of Cuba, the steel tariffs- first imposing them to please one group and then lifting them to please another, and the decision to restore agriculture subsidies. I think many political advisors would recommend this course of action to shore up one's support, considering the current political climate. But we have to see it for what it is-- a pattern of actions designed to lightly benefit others but mainly to benefit the politician's chances for re-election. In the case of the gay marriage ban, Bush has chosen a course of action that even puts Republican lawmakers at a disadvantage because many of them are uncomfortable with a putting such a ban in the Constitution. Doesn't matter to Bush, though. The most important thing to him right now is saving his own ass. Every man for himself. By the way, there's a good article on urlLink swing voters from a recent issue of The Atlantic Monthly.
You're Bosnia-Herzegovina! You've just been through a big tragedy. You weren't sure you were going to make it at all. Now that you have, there's a lot to pick back up in your life, and not enough people are helping you. You just wanted a little more freedom, a chance to be away from those who thought poorly of you. Now it's time to build up some confidence, and it looks like you have a good chance at that. But you'll need a lot of therapy. Take the urlLink Country Quiz at the Blue Pyramid via urlLink Chrisafer
A long talk with Mark last night about how things are going with Joe, his ex. I've been playing the hardass lately, telling him to shit or get off the pot. They broke up two weeks ago, the situation is rapidly deteriorating, and he's still living at the house even though he has arrangements to live with his mom nearby. In other words, everything is ready but he won't make the move. This wouldn't be a bad thing except that he's not fully communicating with Joe about his intentions. So when Mark delays, Joe, who wants to get back together, interprets the delay in a way that raises his hopes. Mark didn't help things last week by sleeping with him again. The point here isn't to force them to break up. What I'm trying to encourage Mark to do is truthfully communicate his intentions to Joe. If you really think the relationship is fully over, then say that's how you feel. Don't do the other guy the disservice of misleading him. If you're uncertain about breaking up, cool. Communicate the uncertainty and talk about it. But don't act like you're not certain in front of your ex when you tell everyone else you are certain. I think you owe it to your partner or ex-partner to be as truthful as you possibly can be, especially when you're breaking up or thinking about breaking up. The stress level is so high, one's hopes are so much in jeopardy. Don't make it worse. I have the easy part. I play the role of best friend and pontificate. Mark has to decide what he'll do.
There have been whispers for weeks that President Bush would ask for a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage. But you can be certain he never would have come out in support of such a thing unless he absolutely needed it for re-election. The issue is strongly divisive, even within the Republican party. Josh Marshall does excellent work, parsing out the urlLink political consequences for various wings of the Republican party. The President's move is purely political and it's designed to help him and only him, even at the expense of the party. What surprises me is not the announcement. Bush has no record of success on which to run, besides the War on Terror and Saddam's capture... all of which is fading. He needs a wedge issue and he's just cynical enough to assume we won't see the political play he's making. What surprises me is the shock and awe among gay Republicans who clung to Bush despite everything else, only to experience the ultimate rejection. Did they not see any of this coming? There's nothing intrinsically wrong with being gay and Republican. There are other issues in this world besides LGBT issues, and I think many of those questions take precedence. And of course, we gay Democrats have been shat upon-- remember DOMA? We are a minority group and like all other minorities, we will be played by the powers that be. But if you had to stake your life and your future on a Republican or a Democrat, which would you choose?
My pal D got back together with his boyfriend of two years over the weekend. So there goes another great one off the market! He wasn't actually "on the market" and I'm happy to see the two of them back together. I met both of them at a little get-together nearly two years ago. It was one of those friend-of-a-friend things so I knew my friend and I knew one of his friends who was hosting the thing at his place in Dupont Circle. But I didn't know anyone else, which is kind of uncomfortable for a quiet guy like myself. I briefly met D and his squeeze there and I don't remember much else from that night. My friend and I stuck around for about an hour and then took off for something else. Anyway, so nearly a year later, I see this cute studly guy on Friendster and I say hi and I think it was he who remembered meeting at the party. So that was the real start of a little friendship that's been kind of cool. I have a presentation this afternoon, which means hours of prep today. I had a series of planning meetings yesterday, but this morning, I'll have to push all the pieces together to get it ready. It'll happen but I'm not looking forward to it. The best part, though, is that I don't have to do it at the office so I'll decamp with the notebook to a nearby Starbucks and set up the office. Just someplace where there are windows.

Friday night was an alcohol fest unlike any I've had in some time. I usually mark the success of a night of heavy drinking by noting the absence of a hangover the next day. So when I got up yesterday morning and felt no residual headache, I was happy. But as the day wore on, I discovered I was too tired to do much of anything. Saturday turned out to be a giant waste and after a movie in the evening, I went home to bed early with a stomach ache - most likely the result of a high toxic load. Today I feel better and a good breakfast helped to set me on the road to what I hope will be a productive week. My friends Chris and David are in Hawaii for several days. I've always been ambivalent about the warm weather haunts that other find so enticing, but today I must say I wish I was there. I'm in one of my negative funks about this city. They don't last very long. When I first moved here, I felt them because I didn't know enough people to have a circle of friends with whom I can hang out. Now I have that, but I think it's time to branch out and find some new places to hang out. No matter how big the city is, you can find guys who will tell you that the gay community is small and gossipy. I didn't believe this, having come from small midwestern cities where there was little if any gay community. It seemed inconceivable to me that one of the nation's ten largest cities, with a large gay community for its size, could seem small in that way. But now I see it and I understand what they mean. In the midwestern college towns where I lived, you could reinvent yourself if you lived there long enough because there was the inevitable churn of the town. After 5-7 years, enough guys had moved on and new ones had moved in, that you had a chance to begin again if you wanted to. It wasn't quite that easy because there will always be "lifers" who stick around to serve as the local storytellers, so your past exploits might still be current with a small group. But many more men seem to stay for a long time here in DC, and reputations, once made or broken, are hard to remake or repair. I'm largely invisible here but 5 years from now, what will people be saying about me? What stupid thing will I have done that will be passed on from one person to the next? When I walk into the bar, how many guys will turn to a friend to whisper something about me? Maybe I'm in a slightly paranoic mood today. No real reason to be but sometimes I wonder when I hear guys dish the really negative shit about some guy... is it true? How has the story grown in the telling? What if it's me they're talking about someday? One answer, of course, is to stay home in my apartment and never leave. Not a pleasing prospect. Another, I suppose, is to try- as much as possible- to have a sense of integrity. That's the way to go, obviously. No brainer. But even small slipups seem to have a way of coming back and biting you in the ass, if the stories I hear passed around about other unfortunates are any guide. So Friday night, I'm at the bar. I'd gone alone, but had acquired a group of friends around me-- mainly guys I hang around with when I'm at the bar but not often outside it (for no good reason). We were having a great time carrying on among ourselves, sampling drinks of different colors, beginning with blue and progressing to light green, dark green, light yellow and red, talking about sex in the crass terms that half-buzzed nasty boys like to do, when we were joined by the Ugly Drunk Guy . He had hung around the outer edge of the group for about an hour and I exchanged a few pleasantries with him and joked about this or that in the way that strangers do at the bar. At this point, he was still Sober Nice Guy, Not My Type . The woman he was talking to left and he began burrowing himself toward the core of my group. I sensed him like Frodo sensed the approach of Gollum. Something told me this wasn't going to be pretty. A couple minutes later, a hand takes hold of my arm, I turn, and come face to face with Ugly Drunk Guy. An obsequious smile on his face, alcohol heavy on his breath, he says in a vampy voice, "I think you're hot. I'd love to have you sit on my lap." If I had this weblog five years ago, I would have told this story and then written, "I didn't know what to say." But I've learned a thing or two and Friday night, I knew what to say. But I didn't. He was a nice person, I told myself, just overly drunk and a little too uninhibited, so I laughed and said, "You've had a lot to drink buddy." Oooohhhh. I can't deliver the withering lines I hear some guys deliver. It makes me seem to be a nicer guy. But it also means I have to put up with a lot more shit. Two minutes later, "We're going dancing, and you should come with." I'm thinking, why does he act like Mae West? My friends are, by now, interested in the exchange and all talk of fucking gets put on hold so everyone can concentrate on Ugly Drunk Guy. I tell him I'm sticking around with my friends. After more fruitless persuasion, he gets up to leave with another friend and grabs me, planting a big wet one right on the lips. I was so surprised that I didn't even say anything. I got so much shit for that from my friends afterward. But the bottom line is this: I won't be mean to someone, and my adherence to this rule means that sometimes I put up with shit that no one else would because I won't publicly draw the line at unacceptable conduct. How often does something like that happen? Once a year. But I'm beginning to think I'm too much of a pushover. Writing it here is the first acknowledgement of it, I suppose. I need to find a way to preserve my essential niceness - I want to be a friendly guy, who says hi to anyone - without letting people take advantage of me like that. I had lunch Saturday at La Tomate with my friend Larry and without me telling my story, he launched into a similar story about getting his ass grabbed at the bar the night before. Larry is in his 50's but he gets attention that some guys 20 years younger don't get. He explained he had to stop being nice after one too many grabs for his butt. The way he told it, he delivered a clear statement about his boundaries and he did it with a smile on his face. That could be my template for saying, "Cut it out." If I had only employed a similar strategy to halt my drinking before Red Drink #2.
Hi. My name is Ralph Nader. I came to your last party four years ago, remember? Things got a little carried way, I know, and you got evicted from your house. But I just wanted you to know that I'm thinking about dropping by again. Save me some cake!
Is anyone else as moved as I am about what is happening in San Francisco? The city's offensive tactic-- filing suit against the state of California over laws that define marriage as being between a man and a woman-- is as thrilling as it is unexpected. We have been fighting a rearguard action for several months now, reeling as victories like Lawrence and Massachusetts have to led to a significant loss of public support for civil unions and gay marriage. There have been lesbian and gay mass-marriage ceremonies during Pride; hundreds of couples have crossed into Canada to exchange vows. But it was easy for others to dismiss them as activists, as outside the mainstream, as a danger to the "sanctity" of marriage. The photos of women and men exchanging vows this week were images of upstanding citizens, people who could be your next door neighbors. What is so powerful about those images of middle-aged lesbians and well-groomed men holding their adopted babies is that one cannot look at those pictures and not feel the emotional tug, the feeling that there's something not quite right about denying these people rights that others enjoy without a second thought. Whatever the backlash to this new episode, those pictures of people getting married in the newspaper this week are worth millions of words of arguments about equality. But because they are so meaningful, here are some of those words. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera: "Mayor Newsom took a bold step last week, and we fully agree with him that his position is justified and that the California Constitution provides that there should be equal opportunity under the law, and not just for straight people but for gay and lesbian people as well." Chicago Mayor Daly this week at a news conference: "A lot of people are opposed to it. So be it. But again, you have to point out the strength of that community -- they're doctors, they're lawyers, they're journalists, they're politicians, they're someone's son or daughter, they're someone's mother or father. "They're parents, and I have been with them. They've adopted children. They have wonderful children. To me, we have to understand this is part and parcel of our families and our extended families." "We have to understand" what the gay couples have been saying: "They love each other, just as much as anyone else. They believe that the benefits they don't have, they should have. And so I have a very open mind on it." Compare those statements to the ignorant and stupid thoughts of our President and First Lady.
First Lady Laura Bush set the bottle down today, and spoke briefly about gay marriage. It is a "very, very shocking issue," she slurred. The First Lady met the press at an appearance in Santa Monica where she offered her regular three sentence spiel on education. When pressed for a deeper, more intelligible response about her personal feelings, Mrs. Bush said, "Let's just leave it at that. Now, where's my Xanax?" fucking asses... all of them.

It's Thursday and while I'm happy with the general progress I've made getting work done this week, I'm also ready for a chunk of personal time this weekend. I have a lot of reading to plow through for work and another project I'm doing. And airfares are good for last minute travel this weekend, so I'm tempted to grab my books and escape for a couple days. I would go someplace familiar so I wouldn't be tempted to do a lot of sightseeing. And right now, the flights from here to NYC, Toronto and Chicago are nicely priced. Yes, none of these places is warm. The Dreamers is on the viewing schedule this weekend and that's basically the only entry on my Outlook calendar from Friday afternoon through Sunday night. i haven't blocked out the time I'll need for the projects yet. But right now, with the weekend so tantalizingly close, who would want to sully it?
I went wading into Irish history for a little project today, not with a history book but with a few webpages and some audio clips from the BBC. It didn't take me long to discover that was about as far as I'd like to go. Irish history is a story of blood and oppression, a tough read under the best of circumstances. I have a small measure of Irish blood coursing through my veins, along with Norwegian, Swedish, German, French, etc. My mom's ancestors seem to have been unable to keep their hands of the tourists. On my father's side, it's easy. They're German. Plain and simple, and I don't think there's anything else. These folks stuck close to home and married their own kind. I envy my friends who come from Italian or Mexican or culturally Jewish families. They have a sense of tradition and heritage. I hitch a ride to these traditions, getting some vicarious enjoyment out of the experience of joining them for holidays and gatherings. Millions of German-Americans have few, if any, traditions. Many Germans in the midwest in the early 20th century were persecuted during the wars for their heritage. Just as American flags appeared on the doors and in the windows of Indian restaurants all over America after 9/11, Germans during the wars tried to be as patriotic and American as they could. I know about that oppression from a PBS documentary, not from the experience of my own ancestors, who may or may not have felt pressure to cleanse themselves of their German heritage. But however it happened, the cleansing took place, and I grew up in a home without a single special German dish, holiday tradition, song, piece of clothing, anything. I feel blessed to have a rich life, but sometimes I sense the great yawning chasm of my past.
urlLink Chase highly recommends "The Dreamers"... the new film from Fox Searchlight. I checked out some previews and it looks incredible. On the agenda for this weekend!
Watching how people behave when they break up is fascinating. Watching how the other people watching them behave is even more fascinating. I'm an observer in the breakup that one of my best friends is going through. What interests me most right now is how people behave in a breakup and how different interests line up. So wander with me through this little tale, which I think says much about the human condition and maybe something about the gay community. Let's briefly set the scene: the story, as always, begins before the breakup. One party, my friend, whom I am calling Mark, after a long period of difficulty and talks with his boyfriend, we'll call him Joe, has arrived at the conclusion that the issues they don't agree upon are so fundamental as to make continuing their long-term relationship difficult, if not impossible. They began a new set of talks, edging toward the breakup. Mark compares it to the Olso Peace Accords, and I think he believes Oslo was less contentious. They have a lot of things to work out. Not just how they will try to be friends and colleagues afterward, but also the myriad financial details, etc. that make breaking up so complicated. There's your backgrounder. Last week, Mark told three individuals outside his closest circle about the breakup, which had occurred a few days earlier. Two were good friends whom he greatly respects and he thought it would be good just to have them hear it from him than from someone else. The third person was a mutual friend of his and Joe's, but probably more in Mark's "camp." Two days later, Joe walks into the bar and, apparently, is greeted by a chorus of sympathizers, all of whom have heard of the horrendous breakup, and want to commisserate, etc. Joe is surprised at this, as is Mark because he told an older gay couple who are unlikely to say anything. But, he had told that other friend, who has, in the space of 48 hours, managed to spread the tale far and wide. Did I mention that Joe walked into the bar with a date? Yes, 4 days after the breakup, 2 days after people started finding out, he shows up with a boy and no one, as far as I can tell, raised an eyebrow. When Mark told me all this, I could do little more than laugh. Here he had gone to great lengths to protect all parties, while Joe walks into the bar, date on his arm. Actually, he went two nights in a row with the same date. Joe himself confirmed this because he was anxious for Mark to know all this, just in case he hadn't already heard it from approximately 1,340 friends. I'm not going to go negative on anyone here. Nor will I moralize any further. What I find most interesting is the power dynamic at play. If you are the person doing the breaking up, you are at a disadvantage most of the time, unless you are emerging from an abusive relationship. If it's not abusive but still bad, you can make the decision to get out and people may be positive to your face, but the majority of them will put you in a negative light in the gossip they tell others. We have a template that we work against when a couple breaks up. Gay or straight doesn't affect this, except that the gay community arguably utilizes gossip more than the majority het community. The template is that the person who breaks up is bad and the person who got broken up with is good. Think about how many times you've seen this play out. The good person gets extra sympathy, sad looks, pats on the back. And yes, the aggrieved person can even walk into the bar, in front of all his friends, with a date half his age, two days after the breakup, and no one will say a word about that behind his back. Yet Mark is concerned about going to the same public places alone because of what people will say to his face or behind his back. I love this. It's how we humans behave and so it's almost beyond judgment. But here's what I really love... how people react when the template doesn't fit. Almost two years ago, a guy I was dating broke up with me. We had dated for only three months and we could see that we were going to be better as friends and not as a couple. We broke up and while it was a little messy, it was alright, as breakups go. The guy and I continued to be friends and we continued to hang out all the time in the gay community. People who were friends of both of us didn't seem to know how to handle it. When one of us was hanging out, they would come up and be all solicitous and offer encouragement and a veiled, negative reference to the other person. Sort of staking their position as being on your side. The same people did this to both of us; we compared notes. The first times they saw us together at the bar after we broke up, chatting away in a nonchalant manner, they would approach but you could see the uncertainty on their faces. Whose side should they be on? Had we truly broken up? Why were we getting along? It was like the breakdown of some kind of social order. Which is what it is, I think. These templates we use to navigate our way through life, love and friendships aren't bad. But maybe we're too dependent on them. Especially in the gay community, where the importance of gossip as a communications mechanism makes this template a kind of iron law.
Kerry might have won last night in Wisconsin, but Edwards got one of his strongest showings so far and that makes me happy. Not because I'm an Edwards supporter. In fact, I don't know now, and I don't think I've ever known, who my candidate of choice is in the Democratic race for the nomination. I guess it would have to be Dean but even early on I wasn't totally in the Dean camp and as the gaffes and misstatements piled up, I turned away. I'm not going to go through some long discourse about my wandering in search of a candidate I like. It would be boring and, frankly, I think we're all doing it these days so it's an essay we could all write. But I am happy that it's not entirely wrapped up yet. Wisconsin could have been a big coronation for Kerry. Instead, Edwards showed he still has some resilience. So on we go to Super Tuesday. And as the formal wrapup still eludes the frontrunner, the Democratic party continues to energize itself as voters discuss the issues and the candidates. A campaign season is supposed to be about defining what a party stands for... not crowning a king ASAP. All of this will make our party better. We hope.
This urlLink short essay by another Mark is a triumph of love over a disease that slowly destroys the lives of millions of people. His words are truly beautiful.
I feel a certain sense of horror at the realization: a full 3 days after Valentine's I've not purchased or consumed even one single candied heart with a trite saying. How can this be?!?!?!?!?!
My pal Chris had a birthday yesterday. And no, this isn't that post you write that is about a birthday, but really means "oh fuck, I forgot to call you yesterday on your birthday." Because I did remember to call yesterday on his birthday.
A long, long, long conversation last night with a friend who is thinking about dating another friend of mine. The conversation slowly wound around and around in a circle. The conversation is about how you end one relationship and you move to the next. That's what he's doing. Or more correctly, he's ending a long-term relationship. What comes next is somewhat uncertain. Now, this conversation was so complicated and touched on so many elements that it would be difficult to do it justice without running into a long explication of everything we talked about. Frankly, I don't have time to do that and I don't think anyone has the time to read through more than 2 hours of conversation. But I thought I would write about one of the main elements of our conversation: a relationship isn't over until you say it's over loudly and clearly and maybe it's not over until you dash the belief of the other person that there might be a glimmer of hope. It sounds kind of harsh to put it that way, and I remember thinking that the first time I dated and broke up with someone and I got this kind of talk from a close friend of mine. My friend Tim sat me down and said, "That guy you dated is really upset." I said, "Of course, he's upset. I broke up with him. Anybody would be upset." Tim said, "The problem isn't that you broke up with him. He doesn't fully understand why you broke up and he also thinks there's a chance you might get back together. He doesn't know why you're not calling him." I shot back, "I thought I made it pretty clear that I was breaking up." Tim responded, "He thinks you are leaving the door open to getting back together again." I was exasperated. "Well, I didn't want to make him feel awful. We were both unhappy and I wanted to soften the blow. So while I don't think I implied that we might get back together, I thought I needed to be as truthful as possible with him." "What does that mean?" asked Tim. "Well, I still like him and I think he's a great person and so while I feel like we have to break up, I also feel like we understand each other well enough that I can lay out the uncertainty I feel about what I'm doing." At this point, I could feel Tim growing a little impatient. He got quiet and said, "Take it from someone who has been on both ends of breaking up. If you're going to break up with someone, you have to fully break up with them. If they like you a lot and you leave the door open to the possibility of something working out in the future, they're going to hold a torch for you. They're going to wait for you. They're going to wonder why you don't call, and this will make them upset. They're going to see you in the bar with someone else and this is going to make them upset because they won't know if it's a friend or if you're on a date. And since they think there's a chance for you two to get back together, this will be devastating to them." "Then what am I supposed to do?" Tim leaned in, "You have to break their heart. I don't mean to imply that you should be a bad person. But the best way to prevent a long series of painful incidents and uncertainty is to instead inflict the pain quickly with the news that it's over. Depending on who it is and how they react, you may not have to say much more on that count. I mean, you don't need to pound the fact into their heads or beat them down with it. But if you're breaking up with them, you have to walk away from your talk knowing that your ex knows that there's no chance of getting back together. You have to be as gentle as you can be. But you must be firm. Causing them some pain now will save them more pain and anger down the road." "Hypothetically, what do I do if, later on, I think I have feelings and I want him back? I've just told him it can't ever happen. Wouldn't it be a little ridiculous to come back and say, 'I've changed my mind'?" Tim smiled. "You should try as much as you can to be certain you have to breakup before you do it. If you do change your mind, there's nothing wrong with going back and asking. But if you leave that guy thinking this is a possibility, he'll be hurt and angry with you if you don't go back. If he likes you, he's going to hold a torch for you. And he'll find it hard to move on because in some way he'll be waiting for you. And that's something you have to bear as your responsibility if you aren't truthful with him." I remember that conversation like it was last Friday, even though it was 5 years ago on a Friday, almost to the day. For a long time, I tried to disagree with it. I wanted to look at it as being unkind to the other guy. Or, in a situation of breaking up, I just couldn't bring myself to say the hard truth: we weren't working out and we were going to have to stop dating. But in those situations, I've come to see Tim's logic. And in dating situations, I've found the best breakups are ones where I was what I'll call brutal but gentle , for lack of a better term. But I've also had to amend this line of thinking. Tim hadn't been in a long-term relationship at the time we talked about this, and neither had I. Now that both of us have that kind of experience, I think we would both agree that ending a long-term relationship, if you have to do it, is never going to be that simple. But I also think we would both agree that the end result has to be about the same: if you respect the guy you've been with but there is no way the two of you can continue together, then you have to make that absolutely clear to them so that you can spare them as much pain as possible.
When we celebrate President's Day, are we allowed to choose the Presidents we'd like to remember and celebrate? I don't feel like celebrating James Buchanan. After seeing the PBS documentary on Civil War Reconstruction, I don't feel like celebrating Andrew Johnson. Hmmm. Harding, Nixon. Bush I and Bush II. Four years from now, would I be saying the same thing about a President Kerry? (I'm not a big fan.) I don't have President's Day off, so I'll be toiling away at my cubicle until as late as noon or 1pm. Well, ok, but not much later than that. I've been going to work early for years. In fact, I've rarely worked a 9-5 job and I don't think I'd want to. I like starting before everyone else does. Public transit is less crowded, there are fewer colleagues at work when I get there. I usually accomplish more in the first 2 hours than I accomplish all the rest of the day at work, once everyone gets there. Plus, it feels great to be walking out the door by 2pm. It means you're at the gym before it's crowded. And you have a little bit of daylight ahead of you, even in winter months, when many people are leaving the office at dusk. The only real problem with this schedule is that I'm not a true early riser. I feel that rising early has intrinsic benefits, but I also like to stay up late. It's a constant battle between my discipline and the late night drink beckoning me from the bar. I wasn't up late last night. I stayed home and watched a documentary I had TiVo'ed about gay and lesbian Jews. It's called "Trembling Before G-d" and it got mainly good notices when it debuted in theaters about a year ago. The first hour was pretty interesting and then my attention started to flag. I picked up the laptop and surfed, alternately checking out the political websites and watching TV until the documentary ended and I hit the delete key. I probably could have stopped and deleted it about half way in, but you never know if it's going to pick up or not. Well, this time... not. I'm in a momentary Marlowe kick these days, so I read "Edward II" and immersed myself in the gay love affair between Edward and Gaveston. You can't be totally correct in calling it gay. There was no idea about "gay" or "homosexuality" at the time. But calling it gay is a good shorthand. Edward II was murdered when his assassin shoved a red hot poker up his "fundament" and I think we all know what that is. No matter what else he might have had shoved up there, that must have been excruciating. Think about it as you're enjoying lunch.
You are a True Elitist. Not like those stupid ass 1337 Speakers, you are the best kind there is. You are irritated with bad spelling/puncuation/grammar and let it be known. You constantly find yourself ranting about things that irritate you and somehow people agree- even those who are the offenders! You probably have charisma coming out of your pores, but are way too elitist to just befriend -anyone-. You, my friend, rock. urlLink What Internet Personality Are You? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla
I arrived first at the restaurant. I had just settled into place, gift bottle of wine for my friend next to me, when in came Terry, with a flourish. My good friend and long-time conversationalist at the bar was my guest for Valentine's Day. Terry is in his mid-50's... one of those gentlemen who-- at any age-- would be in his prime. Debonair, dark hair ever so slightly gray, trimmed moustache, shining eyes, gentle character, he's a man who excites passion in men of all ages. He seated himself at my table and after the expected hug and kiss, we presented gifts. "If you're going to do it, do it all the way," he said, as he reached into a bag and pulled out two ruby champagne flutes and a card. At that moment, the server delivered a ruby vase filled with red, pink and cream-colored tulips and a bottle of champagne. The four lesbians at the table next to us were agog. An auspicious beginning to a memorable evening of food and drink and conversation. Terry and I have been friends for a couple of years. I always saw him at the bar, engaged in conversation with men on either side of him, patrons swooping in for a hug and kiss every few minutes as they passed by. We began striking up conversations, getting to know each other, sharing stories, buying drinks. And that's how its been ever since, a collegial friendship. But is it a friendship if meetings only occur by chance? Yes, but it's one of convenience, a superficial friendship that doesn't get the cultivation it deserves. And so this week, as I was working through contigencies, Terry came to mind. And even before I arrived home last night, full of good food, a little tipsy, and laden with gifts, I was glad he had.
To the young man in the powder blue-- shall we call them-- trunks , three lockers down from me: this is a gym; not a fucketeria.
I will be spending the evening having a splendid dinner with an older friend of mine. We will eat, drink, enjoy other friends and toast the day.

We eat our own. And I'm not talking about rimming. We have a highly perfected mode of character assassination, which after years of interaction inside the gay community, makes no sense to me. But perhaps it's not a surprise because our community sustains itself partly on gossip, which plays a role that's much greater than it is in other communities. This might be a function of a community that emerges in an oppressive society. Before homosexuality was more accepted, much of the conversation among gay men might have been about who else was gay and who was involved with whom. The environment of more generalized acceptance of gays hasn't changed the content of much of the conversation that passes from gay man to gay man. The furtive behavior of anonymous sexual hookups also contributes. There's nothing necessarily wrong with gossip; it's information sharing and it's a constant of human interaction. But its central role in so much interaction among gay men can't be healthy. I won't wag my finger overlong. I gossip, too. It's how I know who's in and who's out in my community. But are we aware of its destructive potential?
I got my haircut yesterday. That belongs in the "Brushed the Cat" level of excitement. But I was excited because I had to miss my last appointment 2 weeks ago and the situation was quickly becoming chaotic. I get it cut every two weeks... rain or shine. Every other Thursday at 3pm... appointments scheduled through the end of this year. I have to. I don't have a hair fetish but if my hair gets long, it gets unruly and drives me crazy. It's amazing, the little things that rule our lives. Thousands of years from now, how will archeologists sifting through the wreckage of our society ever be able to understand this? Two weeks ago, I had to cancel my appointment, and at first, all was well. By this week, it was a tangled, disastrous mess. Not a tangled, disastrous mess that looked good, either. Well, after that stimulating discussion about my hair, allow me to announce that I may do my taxes this weekend. By that, I mean, I may spend 60 minutes on my taxes this weekend. It always takes me a long time to figure in outside earnings, and compile deductions. Let's just say I have a relaxed approach to recordkeeping. I want to eyeball what my refund will be. If it's large enough, I'll file quickly. Oh, the irony, or something: Last May, I went to Toronto with friends Matt and Leeron. My truck was broken into, the thieves grabbing my Palm and Matt's laptop. Wednesday, someone broke into Matt's car here in town... and yes, took his laptop. Except, that for reasons too complicated to explain, it's actually my laptop, minus my hard drive. So, last time, Matt got the new lapper. This time, I do.
from the urlLink Washington Post online : Post E-Mail Disrupted as Domain Expires By Jonathan Krim Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, February 5, 2004; 7:48 PM E-mail communication to and from The Washington Post was disrupted Thursday after its washpost.com Internet address was shut down because the company failed to renew its $35 annual registration. The outage did not affect the ability of readers around the world to read the Post's news Web site, which resides at a separate "domain," washingtonpost.com. But the newspaper's journalists and other employees, who rely on e-mail for communication with sources, advertisers and other clients, were without it for part of the day after washpost.com was shut down. The problem was discovered early Thursday morning when the paper's Baghdad bureau chief, Rajiv Chandrasekaran, was unable to get onto the Post's internal messaging system. E-mail sent to the Post bounced back to the senders, with a notification that the domain no longer existed. Champ Mitchell, chief executive of Network Solutions, said that in the past six months the Post was sent "no less than seven" notifications that the registration was about to expire, most of them by e-mail. A manager in the newspaper's technology division is listed as the contact for the account. Like household bills that are sometimes misplaced or forgotten, Mitchell said that it is not uncommon for a registration to lapse accidentally, though that is generally not a problem with domains bearing names of large companies like the Post. "Big names like you generally have pretty well-organized IT departments," he said.
It's wonderful to be in an unfamiliar space and spot a Sister. I went to an event in another city last night for work and played The Star for a couple hours. This isn't a role that I particularly enjoy but I like meeting people. I was talking to a small group of folks, when I spotted them: the two cute gay guys. Later when I met them, I discovered they run a small theater company. They were hugely cool. I love straight people. Some of them are my best friends. But after everyone began leaving and my duties were done, I relished spending another 10 minutes chatting with a few of my own kind.
You can tell when you've written a bad post. The responses from readers are weird and angry. They write to say you're wrong and then offer their own views and it turns out to be either what you thought you wrote or what you thought you had implied. My post on the relationships of two friends coming to an end prompted a wide variety of comments and emails from people who thought I was giving short shrift to relationships; from people who thought I was unwilling to work at making a successful relationship; from people who thought I would give up at the first sign of trouble; from people who thought, incorrectly, that I was writing about my boyfriend. It prompted lectures and finger-wagging from readers telling me all kinds of stereotypical things about gay men and relationships. All kinds of stuff. I wrote a bad post. I wanted to write about relationships that were beyond hope. NOT relationships that were troubled and could be fixed. Many people treated the essay as though it were advising everyone to leave at the first sign of trouble . Here are my points... the ones I didn't make very well: 1) Relationships are hard. If a relationship is worth maintaining, it must be worked at; and beyond love, a good relationship is an act of will. (Long-time readers know that's a mantra of mine.) 2) Why do people cling to relationships that grow more and more destructive over time? Do they not recognize the growing damage they do to themselves and their partner? Do they hold on to it hoping to fix it? Do they continue with fixes even as each fix falls apart? Do they shut down? 3) If the relationship doesn't work, when is the moment of realization? Is there such a thing or is it a slow dawning? 4) What's the role of friends in relationship troubles... not when encouragement can help mend a relationship, but when the relationship is in serious trouble and seems to be beyond saving? Again, the extreme case is what interests me. It boils down to this: when all hope is gone and the problems cannot be fixed, why do people continue to hold on? Gay, straight, whatever. I ask this because I talked about this with one of the friends who just recently broke up. One of the many questions he asked himself about the final, difficult 2 years of fights, growing disagreements, disillusionment, estrangement etc. before the breakup was... should I have thrown in the towel sooner? I also ask this because in my own case, I believe I've occasionally tried to hold on longer than I should. I've failed to see and understand the very clear warning signs that the relationship I was in was going bad. And when I did realize it, the rescue effort didn't work. I've written a lot here about a disastrous relationship I was in for two years-- that ended more than a year ago. We made three solid tries at making it work. We talked endlessly with each other. We went to a therapist. We consulted friends. Both of us made personal changes and changes as a couple to try to preserve something that we thought might be good... eventually. We both worked hard at it and all three times it failed miserably-- each time for a different reason. And all the trying left scars in both of us that are likely to never go away. Do you see what I'm trying to ask here? I believe that sometimes people stay in relationships that aren't working... trying to fix them with the best of intentions when the problems are so deep and systemic that they cannot be fixed. They do themselves and their partners great harm and when the relationship finally does come apart it's a bomb that inflicts damage over a wide area. The questions are many. If you're in a relationship with difficulties... how do you assess what can be fixed and what can't? Do you trust your own judgment? Who else do you talk to? As a friend, how blunt or honest should you be? Should you always begin with advice for mending it, even when your outside view is that it can't be fixed? Why do people hold on for so long when it's apparent to everyone, often even the players involved, that it's hopeless? We hear a lot about how gay men have more trouble with relationships. I think that's a very important question that deserves better, more carefully considered answers than gay men are sluts or they don't try hard enough . Maybe we should give this some careful thought, too.
Eight years. A friend of mine and his partner broke up yesterday after being together nearly eight years. Another friend of mine has broken up with his boyfriend of a year and a half. Maybe long term, all parties will look back and see these as good decisions, but it's still sad. I urlLink wrote here a month ago about the moment of realization that a relationship is over... and I was thinking of one of these relationships at the time. They're not easy under any circumstances, and while we as friends should do all we can to support our friends in relationships, I don't feel any obligation to encourage friends to stay in relationships that aren't working. How you calculate whether yours is working or not is up to you. But I'm relatively hard-nosed about the pursuit of happiness and I've learned the hard way that if you're not happy and the situation can't be fixed, then it's time to get out. One can take that to a selfish extreme and that's not good. But, too often, people stay in less than good or just plain bad relationships out of inertia or fear of being single. And too many gay people on the sidelines are quick to pounce and point to a breakup as a sign that gay men either just can't have a good relationship or they're too promiscuous to want to stay together or they just can't see how good they had it, etc. Have you noticed that 1) these people are nearly always single themselves; and 2) they're losers? The gay community's rampant desire to be accepted by the straight world has led, predictably, to some rather fucked up views of what is a successful gay life. The Successful Gay Life is not the aping of a model provided by the majority culture; and it's not defined by the incessant carping that comes from inside your minority culture. It's what you define it to be.
The day dawns with three viable candidates to watch... and a fourth candidate who must be painfully aware that his time is drawing to an end. Kerry won Missouri, Arizona, North Dakota, Delaware and New Mexico. Edwards won handily in South Carolina and Clark eked out a win in Oklahoma. Lieberman failed to win Delaware, which, inexplicably, would have kept him alive. He exited the race last night. Sharpton had his best showing yet in South Carolina. I think we know it will be the high point of his campaign. Kucinich, unless I missed something, was nowhere to be found last night. No mention of headquarters (does he have one anymore?) and no mention of a Kucinich speech anywhere. Well, who would make an appearance with a showing that poor? The bigger question is: who would be running with a showing that poor? Kucinich is clutter and needs to get the hell out. The Edwards and Clark wins complicate the Dean strategy. In fact, Clark's relatively strong finish in a few of the states he didn't win is probably the final nail in the coffin. Here's why: Dean and his strategist Roy Neel have built their strategy on the assumption that the other candidates would quickly fizzle in the face of the Kerry onslaught. That would leave a wounded Howard Dean still standing... the last alternative to Kerry. At that point, fundraising and support for Dean would revive and Dean would reemerge as a viable candidate. But what happens now? Edwards and Clark both got important wins yesterday. Not enough to ensure them much of a future. But enough for them to hang on at least a few more weeks. And those slower fades for the Edwards and Clark campaigns seal the fate of the Dean campaign, which won't see the field open fast enough to regain financial and voter support and get going again. What would I do if I were Dean? I would hold on through Saturday's races in Michigan and Washington and pray for a miracle. Thousands of Michigan voters cast their ballots early by mail or the Internet and it's likely that a chunk of them will be for Dean. If Dean is really lucky, he could come in third in Michigan. But Michigan voters, while they signed up early to get their ballots, were delaying casting their votes throughout January. The news stories in Michigan showed very small numbers of votes actually cast during much of last month... well into the "new reality" of Dean's fall and Kerry's rise. And, in fact, Dean conceded yesterday on MSNBC that he doesn't have a chance in Michigan. I won't say Dean is finished. I said it three days after the Iowa Caucuses.
um... anyone seen Dennis Kucinich??? To quote the candidate from an early debate... HELLO?!?!?!
"To Kerry and Edwards... if it's Gore on the phone, don't pick up."
from the AP 9:14pm: ''A huge night.'' That's how Senator John Kerry describes his victories that have solidified his standing as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Kerry says he's ''stunned'' to have won Missouri, Arizona and Delaware. The race in Oklahoma is still too close to call, with Kerry slightly behind retired General Wesley Clark and Senator John Edward. In an interview with The Associated Press, Kerry dismissed Edwards' win in South Carolina, saying a national campaign is needed to win the White House. He says tonight, his campaign has shown its ability to do just that.
Watching to see how two different paths of analysis will play out tonight and tomorrow. 1) Edwards is a regional candidate so a big win in South Carolina keeps him alive but does little to give him extra momentum in the rest of the country. Especially since Edwards doesn't have a lot of money for a full court press in states to come. 2) Kerry's momentum has been stalled by Edwards' win in SC and the likely win of one of the other candidates in OK. This, despite massive Kerry wins in the other states.
I've barely had the opportunity to get started-- you know, a hearty breakfast of oatmeal sprinkled with ricin-- and the day is already upon us. I'm still kind of stuck back in the weekend, sitting in the cafe on a Saturday morning. That's wonderful, except it's now Tuesday. The weekend was quiet. I caught myself up on a lot of personal reading Friday night and Saturday, not really going anywhere because it was cold and I couldn't think of any ready excuses to get out and about, beyond a three block radius of my loft. I went out to dinner with a friend on Saturday evening, eating a big Italian meal, followed by a sinful dessert. Well, it's the weekend, what are ya gonna do about that? Movie plans were postponed. We couldn't think of anything worth seeing. Sunday... hmmm. There were just enough activities to ensure people wouldn't think I was dead but that was it. Reading the papers, a book, the Super Bowl. You can't write a lot about doing nothing, can you? Friday night I went to the bar and had a long conversation with a couple of fervent Dean supporters. They're good friends of mine and I have enormous respect for them. We had an exchange about what was ahead for Dean and I was frank about what I think is going to happen in the next few weeks. They disagreed, but only somewhat. I think I'll turn out to be right, but even if I am, there's no joy in it. It's not like I'm betting on the big game, rooting for my team, and then when they win, lording it over the losers. Politics isn't a game, despite what you see on CNN and Fox News. There are winners and losers, but that's as far as the comparison goes. I don't want to play it that way. In fact, a small part of me hopes I'm wrong and Dean isn't done. But the facts don't support it. Temperatures have "warmed" back up. Today, we'll be in the upper 30's. That won't last but upper 20's, I can deal with. I could also seriously deal with San Diego right about now.
... time for a break. I'm going to take some time away from the weblog. A month. Two months. Maybe longer. After doing it as long as I have... 7 years in one form or another, it's worth a breather. take care!
Here's a point to ponder... for no very good reason: could I date a guy who does gigs in drag? there's this guy, who is cute, hot - actually in women's clothing and men's. My parents are Mr. and Mrs. P-FLAG, but I can imagine the dinner table conversation that follows the question, "So, what do you do in your spare time?" If I loved him and we were together, it wouldn't be an issue, of course. But my moderately conservative Lutheran parents still prefer to think of gay men in their more straight acting, straight appearing permutations. They've met most of my friends and most of them are of that particular category. Just a thought. Pointless mental excursion, yes. But that guy is hot. If we lived near each other, I'd ask him out right now .

urlLink Waremouse and others consider the urlLink Log Cabin Republican's decision to challenge the Bush administration more directly on the anti-gay marriage amendment. It's notable and encouraging to see they're going to begin a small ad campaign and that they have apparently been telling the White House regularly of their opposition to the amendment. And yet, the president has supported the amendment strongly anyway, even though Republicans in Congress by and large would rather have nothing to do with the amendment. Waremouse uses the key word, in my view: credibility. The Log Cabin Republicans have little credibility within the gay community because of the ways in which they have bent over backward to defend President Bush. Any crumb that falls from this administration's table is a feast for the LCR and is praised as such. The problem is, most of us know it's a few neglected morsels. I think that credibility gap in the gay and lesbian community has been much discussed. But let me add that I think there's another credibility problem: the Log Cabin Republicans have little cred within the administration. Why should they? They represent a group that Republicans assign a low level of priority. And this: gays and lesbians, when it comes to issue that lie close to the heart, invariably find themselves at loggerheads with this administration. It might not be national defense or guns. But when the issue really hits home, like your hospital visitation rights, or survivorship benefits, or your right to adopt children, in other words, the basic rights to lead an ordinary life... the Republicans, at best, will support you grudgingly; it's a compromise of their principles to "award" you those rights. That's not the Republican party of much of the twentieth century, but it is the GOP of today. If you can support an administration like that, well go ahead. But I think cynics in the administration will smell your desperation... and that's no help to your cause.
... the urlLink new image from Hubble, staring back about 13 billion years. And an accompanying urlLink story from the New York Times .
The news of Spalding Gray's death comes as a surprise and a shock. I didn't realize he had been missing for about two months. Did any of us, or was the story widely publicized and I was glossing over too much in the daily papers? Lately, I feel like I've been glossing over way too much in the papers. There are stories like today's piece about Hubble's latest photos peering 13 billion years into the past. Or the remarkable study showing the success of higher doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs like Lipitor. My personal interests and my career require a higher than average attention to foreign policy issues, but even today, while I was digesting Walter Russell Mead's article on "sticky power" in Foreign Policy, my eye kept straying to that picture the Hubble took. It's quite sad, really, that Hubble's future is in jeopardy. It's NASA's beloved mascot, if an orbiting telescope can be such a thing. It has created incalculable goodwill for NASA, but the agency is likely to let it fall into disrepair and eventually drop to earth in some kind of controlled descent and end up in a museum. This end is to be expected, but not extending the telescope's life a few more years seems an exercise in poor judgment. What rankles is that, safety concerns about sending the shuttle to the telescope aside, this is the result of President Bush's "visionary" bit of election politics-- the human push to the moon and Mars. Laudible goals, yes, but vastly expensive. And why should a greater human exploration of space come at the expense of Hubble? Is it worth risking the lives of seven astronauts and spending a few hundred million dollars to return to Hubble and give it a few more years of life? I think so.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that President Bush's tax cut will have little effect on the economy at large, beyond sinking the country deeper into debt. urlLink The New York Times today says the report shows the President's proposals could either increase or decrease economic output in the next 5 years. There might be some improvement after that, too. "However, the differences are likely to be small, affecting output by less than one-half of one percentage point on average." Our annual economic output is now in the range of $12 trillion dollars. As the Times and other sources point out, the tax cuts that Bush has proposed to make permanent are a gnat compared to the Empire State Building of our country's national output. Does this mean that tax policy no longer has a significant impact on the US economy? No, but what it does mean is that any reasonable proposal to lower or raise taxes is likely to have little, if any, impact on the economy. You don't have to be a genius to see that tax cuts such as Bush has proposed won't affect the economy much, but they do have a big impact on the federal deficit. And as the national debt grows, it places a growing burden on future generations. So, let me see: make the tax cuts permanent because they will have virtually no impact on the economy, while they'll be challenging the future fiscal sovereignty of our government. You would think this was a no-brainer. And, increasingly, it might be. The Times reports GOP congressional leaders are apparently going to simply ignore Bush's proposal to make the cuts permanent. Senator Don Nickles says, "It's time to be responsible." And isn't it comforting to know that someone has decided that might be a good idea? So, Bush will be on the campaign trail... going on and on about how his tax cuts should be made permanent, to put America back to work again. In the real world, it's a no-go. As it should be.
Gay Republicans continue to wring their hands and mumble, even as their President continues to use the opportunities available to him to announce his support for a ban on gay marriage. There's another sad urlLink article in today's New York Times , showing the "difficult choices" that gay and lesbian Republicans face. I'm not upset by this at all, really. The individuals quoted in the article seem, by and large, to be for marriage. They had hoped the President wouldn't come out in support of the anti-marriage amendment and now that he has, some of them continue to hope that he won't talk about it too much. Many of them stress that they're not single issue voters. The Times quotes one lesbian who is a registered Republican and a member of Pink Pistols (huh?), an organization of gay and lesbian gun owners: "All the Democrats just rolled into Congress to vote for this gun control bill. Somebody with my values and beliefs can't be a single issue voter." Except that she is, as you can plainly see, of course. (Her single issue just happens to be guns.) Other gay Republicans cite the President's warrior stance on terror, the tax cuts, and his leadership, in general, as their reasons they're going to vote for him, in spite of his support for the amendment. Well, that's fine. Gays and lesbians can legitimately discuss whether there should be gay marriage or not. They're also free to make their decision between the candidates based on a range of issues. I see them less as traitors to the gay cause and more as another subset of deluded individuals who see Bush as winning the "war on terror" and showing leadership with tax cuts that have almost no impact on anyone's lives but that create multi-billions in red ink. There are millions like them in this country, content to get their news from Fox or CNN or the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, willing to accept the hot air of the anti-tax rhetoric at face value. What we need to do is make sure that there are more of the rest of us voting on November 2nd. Now that my rant is over, let me say that I contiinue to be surprised at the continuing momentum of the marriage controversy. When the marriages began in San Francisco, I thought it would be a flash in the pan and that the public at large would see it as another group of activists outside the mainstream. I assumed they would see it the way many Americans see gay pride parades - a gross indulgence that confirms their worst, most irrational fears about gays and lesbians. But, in the main, they haven't. And the effort by conservatives to paint it that way simply cannot stand up to the photographic evidence - the happy couples, many of them together for years, for the first time getting to enjoy a privilege that has been denied them for so long. Gay and lesbian couples in late middle age, young gays and lesbians with their children, those are amazing images that can't be dismissed. The same can be said of the power of the very simple argument: who gets hurt if gay marriage happens? Specifically, whose life, liberty or pursuit of happiness is curtailed if urlLink those two lesbians kissing on the news report get to marry? I still think this will be put to an end, but we will feel the repercussions of what has happened for a long time to come and the debate over gay marriage has been permanently altered. Now, that's amazing.
Read urlLink George Packer's piece on the lack of foreign policy vision in the Democratic party from the Feb. 16 New Yorker, if you haven't already. I think it's brilliant and there's an important message for Republicans in the article, as well. It crystallizes a lot of frustration I feel with the Democrats over this issue, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.

My friend Mark went to see "Passion" this weekend. I had planned not to. And I'm still pretty certain I won't. Not so much out of any sense of protest. More out of the conviction that, after reading reviews from sources I trust, the expense of $8.50 (plus candy) on this movie isn't worth it. Not that I would feel comfortable eating a bag of Sour Patch Kids while watching Christ writhe as he endures beatings and all manner of tortures. As the camera lovingly records, in slow motion, the application of those tortures. Isn't a movie like this the classic definition of porn? I've read there's some bad acting. I've read from a number of informed sources that the charge of anti-semitism can be made legitimately against this film. But, ultimately, my issue with Gibson's portrayal of Christ's Passion is that the suffering of Christ is beside the point. I grew up in evangelical Protestant churches, which were perhaps a little anti-Catholic at times, but were rarely, if ever, anti-semitic. At worst, Jews were seen as the Chosen People who had gone astray in not accepting Christ. But there was never a sense of culpability, an assigning of blame, to the Jews for Christ's death. Protestants, by and large, view the death of Christ as absolutely necessary for the redemption of humanity. Thus, the portrayal of Christ's death as a crime is problematic because the reality in the minds Christians is, or should be, much more complicated than that. I was raised to believe that Christ was the son of God, born of a virgin. He preached to the masses, performed miracles, was rejected by the establishment, died on the cross and rose again. Regardless of how I feel about each of those pieces of information now, the suffering that Christ endured is allegorical: his bearing of the sins of all humanity. To dwell on who inflicted it, or how it was inflicted, or how intensely, or how gruesomely, is to exhibit a clear lack of understanding why it happened. But the why is what matters, not the how . Gibson is peddling a highly prejudiced, fringe point of view. And Christians who are too stupid to understand what he's doing are falling over each other trying to either endorse or defend the film. It's indefensible. The same can be said for conservatives, who have embraced this film simply because many liberals are upset about it. The problem is, any conservative Christian watching this film should be deeply disturbed by Gibson's theology. That many of them aren't shows an utter lack of principle.
Checked voicemail about 4pm yesterday... message from Chris: "I decided to drive to my parents to pick up the dog, rather than force them to meet halfway." I returned the call and a few minutes later, I was on my way. Chris is one of my best friends and I don't see him nearly as often as I'd like. We had a relaxed evening, I got a home-cooked meal from his mom, and we sat around and shot the shit for a couple hours before I needed to get back to the city. It was the perfect close to a harried week of meetings, presentations and last minute preparations before my trip. Yes, it meant that I didn't get packed last night. Yes, there's a large list of unfinished business. Yes, taking care of all of that will probably mean I won't be able to hitch a ride on an earlier flight as I'd hoped. But after the relaxing time with close friends last night... I don't care. It was worth even a little more rushing around today.
The Bush re-election strategy is likely to go through several permutations between now and November. Version 1.0 will be this oft-repeated concept of "Steady Leadership in Times of Change." urlLink Josh Marshall writes that the new commercials, to be unveiled today in some markets, follow this theme: things haven't been very good... but they're not my fault. Now, there's a compelling reason to vote for George W. Bush. No wonder the polls still show a slight majority of voters preferring Kerry.
10pm: I'm home at last after a three hour evening meeting, and let me just say how much I love evening meetings. I'm cold, hungry, I smiled at a hot guy on the bus and he ignored me and now, at home, there's not a fucking thing to eat in this house except for some Wasa crackers, a chocolate bar and 2 eggs. And half a bag of frozen soybeans. Soybeans it is. Two Wasa crackers. A blanket. My big warm bed. Another day awaits.
via urlLink Logan Circle , urlLink Conservative Punk , the website with the mission: 1. To inform today's youth that identify themselves with the punk scene with the facts, rather than rumor and conspiracy theory. 2. To encourage today's youth to register to vote and become engaged in politics. 3. To encourage youth voters to draw there own conclusions rather than indoctrinate them into a certain way of thinking. The site asserts there is a "right" side of punk, which strikes me as reminiscent of "Christian Aerobics," that favorite of evangelicals in the late 1980's. There are columns written by older men who likely never were "punk," in the sense that most of us understand punk to be. Oh, they might have been rebels, but refusing to turn up the collar on your polo shirt doesn't really count as social protest. Looking over the site, you can imagine the group of 30- and 40-something white men sitting around in shirts and ties with the sleeves rolled up, all upset that urlLink Punk Voter is acting as the sole political voice of the punk movement. And so, there is an "alternative" for the rebellious, yet politically conservative (?) white young man. That's the inherent contradiction, of course. If you check out Punk Voter, it's all rather slick and has the "designed by committee" look. As much as I'm not a part of the punk movement, I can't imagine someone looking at either site and thinking, "people like me made this." And another thing: isn't the punk movement about protest? Overthrowing the powers that be? Punk Voter has medallions of Bush with words like "veto" on his forehead and there's the clear message: Bush is bad for this country and has to go. What does Conservative Punk want you to protest? That the job growth figures are better than the liberal media suggest. Yeah, take that to the streets, my multi-pierced Friends of Bush.
A friend wrote asking why Kerry is against a federal amendment banning gay marriage but is urlLink willing to support such an amendment in Massachusetts , defining marriage as between a man and a woman, as long as it provides for civil unions and domestic partnership benefits. Gay activists are upset because civil unions wouldn't provide anywhere near the legal benefits to gay couples that marriage would. And there's no doubt in my mind that Kerry knows this. This is the most “bottom line” oriented political analysis I can think of for his stand. It may not be how he is going about this, but it's the closest I can get to a line of reasoning: 1) Kerry has not supported gay marriage in the past, although he has been supportive of LGBT causes in general. So there’s a certain consistency here. 2) Kerry doesn’t support an amendment banning gay marriage at the federal level and this also seems to be consistent. 3) If Kerry were to support gay marriage, it would be seen by many, including many in the Democratic party, as an extreme position. The Bush campaign would pull out the “left-wing, liberal Senator from a left-wing, liberal state” charge and beat him over the head with it. He’s already going to be subject to this because of the MA Court ruling and connections to Dukakis, etc. There’s a rich vein of trouble for Dems that the GOP is already mining. Support for gay marriage would increase the trouble. 4) So, Kerry probably feels he has to hew a careful line. Support civil unions; speak out strongly in favor of them; if MA goes ahead with an amendment, that’s acceptable, but it must allow for civil unions and domestic partnership. 5) If he takes that line, who gets mad at Kerry: some Republicans who don’t want civil unions at all. They were never going to vote for Kerry anyway. He also suffers with the more politically attuned segment of the gay community, which supports marriage and will be mad as hell but sure as hell won’t support Bush. 6) How does he “win:” He’s seen (potentially) as being moderate but still concerned overall for the plight of gays and lesbians. I’m probably off on a couple of things or am missing something, but I think that’s the basic calculation. Politically, it’s probably smart, if you’re thinking only about getting elected. Remember, this is a nasty issue for everyone in an election year. Bush knows it’s divisive among Republicans. If he could avoid it, he would. But Rove decided he needed it to shore up the GOP core. For lawmakers, an amendment is the last thing many of them want, for a variety of reasons—this doesn’t belong in the Constitution, it's a political nightmare, etc. They’re pissed at Bush for putting them in this bind even as Bush tries to save his own skin. Democrats who are, overall, supportive of LGBT issues but not ready to go all the way with marriage suddenly find many of their gay supporters upset with them. And on and on. This is the classic wedge issue. Everybody hurts, but again, Bush’s/Rove’s calculation has been that Bush will be hurt the least, despite the internal damage this might cause in his own party.

Another long chat over big salads, as Mark and I talked about him, his ex Joe. After a couple weeks of seeing no real effort on his part to take action regarding Joe- either to stay or go, and then a couple of weeks of frustrating conversation with him as he talked one way and acted another (all of which I've written about here in annoying detail), we had a good talk where we were able to nail down some things. We also had a fruitful conversation about fears that he has about becoming more independent. Even if they do get back together, I think Mark and Joe will spend some time living apart. Mark wasn't a kept boy but he entered that relationship when he was very young, so the prospect of moving out on his own and being fully responsible for himself has been daunting. He's wound himself in layers upon layers of questioning about how to proceed, so I used my "good friend" status to step into the middle of it and try to give him a clearer view of that. I'm not Mr. Advice, nor do I play such a character in real life. But we spent some time talking about how he might systematically work through these issues; how to think through and develop a step by step process for moving in with friends, finding an apartment, getting a new job that pays more, getting his own car, etc. It was the best conversation we've had about all of this crap in several weeks. I'm an over-analyzer with the best of them. Fuck, I write long entries in this journal about all kinds of things that others spend much less time thinking about. But, I've always believed there comes a time when you have to act. Thought shouldn't go round and round without end. At some point, a plan gels. Possible actions and consequences begin to become clear. It's like the business mantra that meetings need to be about something, that they need to lead to something actionable. I can't rule Mark's life; I have enough of my own to deal with. But I can help him out a little bit with some of his fears about what's ahead. And I can get myself out of their relationship mess because the last thing those two need is more complications. You know what? There's nothing like walking into a room that's a mess and putting it in order. Life is never that simple, but that doesn't mean we can't impose some kind of order on it. And I've imposed the order that I feel is necessary so I can feel good about things and so Mark and Joe can try to make another go of it, if they want. This was actually the easy mess to clean up. Next, I have to do my taxes.

I've already implied it, I've been more explicit with those of you who have written to ask what's up. I'm going to spend a lot of time writing about the Canadian elections during the month of June. For two reasons: 1) I am a Canada-ophile; have been since I was 10yo and was more interested in the Winnipeg school lunch menus, as announced on the CBC, than I was in my own; since CBC programs regularly became available on American radio in 1980 and I could hear them without tuning the shortwave dial; and since President Bush reminded me how idiotic we Americans can be sometimes. 2) I love politics. And 3) American politics is just plain shitty and boring right now, so if I take a month off from it I'm not likely to miss anything. Yes... three reasons why I'm going to write about Canadian politics. I will try to say smart and provocative things and not mess up. If I do, I trust kind Canadian readers will set me straight. Unlike the Canadian TV networks, I don't have a logo-encrusted bus outfitted with all the latest technology that I'm driving all over the country, in an effort to discover what Canadian voters think about the issues. I do, however, have a black Ford Escape XLT (featuring CD changer) that I've driven several times across a portion of Ontario in the past week and I feel confident that I've learned as much about what concerns Canadian voters as the networks will.
The story of the capsizing of the paddlewheeler Victoria on Victoria Day in 1881, resulting in the deaths of more than 200 people, should be a sad-- if forgotten-- moment in Canadian history. Forgotten, it is. But sad? Actually, urlLink if you read the story , it's almost ridiculous. The paddlewheeler was apparently overloaded. Capacity was 400 but there are accounts of 600 on-board for the 3.5 mile trip on the Thames River near London, Ontario. The heavily laden boat struck a rock, which opened the hull. The boat began to sink. A group of rowdy teenagers began running from one side of the boat to the other, causing it to tip precariously. But this didn't stop a group of rowdy teenagers on the lower deck from rushing side to side, rocking the shallow-draft boat so severely her rails almost dipped into the river. They were singing the gospel song One More River to Cross. When two racing sculls swept past, passengers on both levels rushed to get a look at them. The vessel dipped dangerously starboard. Frightened, the passengers tried to counterbalance the ship by running to the opposite railing. The Victoria dipped even more dramatically to that side, flinging many passengers into the river. At that point, the boat's three-quarter-tonne boiler crashed through its engine room walls and slid across the slanted deck into the river. Along the way, it severed the steam pipes and the pillars supporting the upper deck, crushing and scalding several people. The heavy canvas roof of the collapsed upper deck dropped onto those floundering in the water. As one survivor described it, hundreds were trapped "like rats in a cage." By the way, all of this happened about 40 feet from shore. Frankly, if the boat had tipped the other way, it probably would have flung the passengers onto dry land. And, as if that's not enough, Macleans goes on: Rescuers placed the retrieved bodies on the riverbank. Thieves stole personal belongings from the bodies as well as from the garments the rescuers had discarded before jumping into the river. Some owners of hearses, cabs and wagons charged exorbitant rates. And, according to Ken McTaggart, author of London's Darkest Hours, a few even tucked invoices into the dead bodies that they delivered and left propped against the door of their homes. Well, OK, it is sad. But you gotta admit: the tragi-comic potential is off the charts.

Blog readership is usually about nil the Friday of Memorial Day Weekend. I had planned not to publish anything over the weekend. But you know how it is. A few extra minutes... available wireless connection... the run-of-the-mill vanity that underlies our desire to have one of these things in the first place. So, what the hell. The first two years of this weblog, I published for virtually no audience. It didn't stop me back then and it won't stop me now. A couple things on the agenda for the first part of the long weekend. urlLink The LGBT Film Festival concludes this weekend and since I only managed to catch one film last weekend, I'll try to improve my score somewhat this weekend. Latter Days played last night and I kick myself because I've missed more than my fair chare of opportunities to see it. The other half predicts this will end up being a Netflix movie. He may be right. The other big to-do item on the agenda is the 5th annual urlLink Doors Open collection of tours of important buildings and homes this weekend. There are more than 150 sites with tours this year. I've whittled the list down to about 20 buildings that I'd like to check out. Experience tells me I'll make it to a maximum of 3 locations before I decide to move on. Last half of the weekend will likely be a hip-hop, skip and jump over to urlLink Detroit's Electronic Music Festival . To American readers... have a great Memorial Day Weekend! To all... have fun and be safe.
A urlLink harsh piece from Salon , but probably no harsher than need be, on the subject of Judith Miller's reporting on Iraq in the New York Times during the lead-up to the Iraq War. Miller is by no means the only reporter responsible for the general lock-step acceptance of Ahmad Chalabi's fictions about Iraq and WMD. Nor is the New York Times the only news organization that should be apologizing for the generally poor quality of its reporting, in hindsight. The Bush administration, after all, apparently hung on every word from Chalabi, who seems to have said whatever it would take to get America to invade. As Salon notes, "The Times plays an unequaled role in the national discourse." When it doesn't do the job expected of it, the repercussions can be huge.
I think spring was cancelled and no one remembered to send the memo telling the rest of us. It was a bothersome winter, an annoyingly cold and cloudy spring... and now, on the edge of summer, we're treated to cloudy, damp 70 degree days... with the added joy of the occasionaltornado and heavy rains. All of the horrors of spring and none of the pleasure. Where did all of the good weather go? I now know the answer: St. John's, Newfoundland. I was watching Ian Hanumansing on CBC News Monday night and he was on-location, standing outdoors on a beautiful afternoon... in St. John's, Newfoundland, for god's sake! So if you're looking for those golden late spring afternoons that you've been missing this year, get in your car and drive north.
Another day, another article from Washington Monthly that I think is worth your attention: urlLink Fred Kaplan's piece on the Bush administration's blunders with respect to North Korea . Kaplan argues that by turning its back on the Clinton policy toward North Korea-- which had brought about great progress-- and because of its pursuit of a policy of "moral purity" with respect to North Korea... the Bushies have lost an opportunity to improve relations with Kim Jong il. They also have made the world a much more dangerous place to live, by allowing North Korea to develop nuclear weapons. A nicely argued piece and an issue that needs to be in front of voters even as Bush and his team try to create the impression of a leader making the world safer for democracy.

In light of President Bush's address on the transition in Iraq-- the first of a series of speeches on the subject-- check out urlLink this article by Wes Clark in the May '04 "Washington Monthly." Parts of the piece aren't groundbreaking. I think there are several notable foreign policy experts who have been arguing that the parallels drawn to the cold war and the Soviet Union by neo-cons don't stand up to scrutiny. Neo-cons believe the moral absolutism of Reagan brought down the USSR. And in the same way, they argue Bush's moral absolutism will help to bring about a fundamental shift toward democracy in the Arab world. Clark is one of the naysayers. Clark writes that the foreign policy consensus coalesced around containment, an idea which had been in the air since the early post-war period, when George Kennan, then a veteran American diplomat, published his seminal Foreign Affairs article "The Sources of Soviet Conduct." Kennan argued that the Soviet system contained within it "the seeds of its own decay." During the 1950s and 1960s, containment translated that observation into policy, holding the line against Soviet expansion with U.S. military buildups while quietly advancing a simultaneous program of cultural engagement with citizens and dissidents in countries under the Soviet thumb. These subtler efforts mattered a great deal. The 1975 Helsinki Accords proved to be the crucial step in opening the way for the subsequent peaceful democratization of the Soviet bloc. The accords, signed by the Communist governments of the East, guaranteed individual human and political rights to all peoples and limited the authority of governments to act against their own citizens. However flimsy the human rights provisions seemed at the time, they provided a crucial platform for dissidents such as Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov. These dissidents, though often jailed and exiled, built organizations that publicized their governments' many violations of the accords, garnering Western attention and support and inspiring their countrymen with the knowledge that it was possible to stand up to the political powers that be. Another clip: Rising Soviet defense spending aimed at competing with the United States may have hastened the economic decline in the Soviet Union, helped convince the Russian generals that they couldn't compete with U.S. military technology, and strengthened Gorbachev's hand as he pushed for glasnost. But this end-game challenge of Reagan's would have been ineffective had 40 years of patient Western containment and engagement not helped undermine the legitimacy of the Communist regime in the eyes of its subjects. It was popular discontent with economic, social, and political progress, and people's recognition of an appealing alternative system, that finished off the repressive regimes of Eastern Europe, and eventually the whole Soviet Union. Clark goes on to advocate something short of regime change brought about by military force. Instead, he asks America to consider pursuing a much slower and more difficult course, but one that's more likely to produce-- if not democracy as we know it, then governments that are more accountable to their citizens. It's another path in the battle against terrorism and time might show us it's more effective-- even as it was effective in bringing about the end of Soviet-style communism. Read the article, if you get the chance.
I'll write more later, but we'll start the day, and the week, with a an Iraq-related story-- a deeper urlLink piece on Ahmed Chalabi from Time magazine . It's worth paying attention to the upcoming Canadian elections, not merely because we ought to pay more attention to our northern neighbor (hint: it's a real country, people) but also because this is going to be one of Canada's more interesting races in some time. Todd's Ten Second State of Canadian Politics : the Liberal's Martin is sliding, Bloc Quebecois is rising but regional, Conservatives are new and more moderate and the NDP has the good looks of Jack Layton. Recommended websites: urlLink The Globe and Mail and urlLink CBC News .
urlLink Howard Kurtz in the Washington Post : I don't want to hear about how the soldiers lacked the proper "training." And I don't want to read any more interviews in which neighbors say how nice they seemed. Anyone with half a brain would find this sort of thing sadistic. And they can't exactly argue that they're trying to extract information from a recalcitrant trainee, since the subject in question is quite clearly deceased.
Excerpts from urlLink today's Washington Post : Previously secret sworn statements by detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq describe in raw detail abuse that goes well beyond what has been made public, adding allegations of prisoners being ridden like animals, sexually fondled by female soldiers and forced to retrieve their food from toilets. The detainees said they were savagely beaten and repeatedly humiliated sexually by American soldiers working on the night shift at Tier 1A in Abu Ghraib during the holy month of Ramadan, according to copies of the statements obtained by The Washington Post. Some of the detainees described being abused as punishment or discipline after they were caught fighting or with a prohibited item. Some said they were pressed to denounce Islam or were force-fed pork and liquor. Many provided graphic details of how they were sexually humiliated and assaulted, threatened with rape, and forced to masturbate in front of female soldiers. "They forced us to walk like dogs on our hands and knees," said Hiadar Sabar Abed Miktub al-Aboodi, detainee No. 13077. "And we had to bark like a dog, and if we didn't do that they started hitting us hard on our face and chest with no mercy. After that, they took us to our cells, took the mattresses out and dropped water on the floor and they made us sleep on our stomachs on the floor with the bags on our head and they took pictures of everything." "They said we will make you wish to die and it will not happen," said Ameen Saeed Al-Sheik, detainee No. 151362. "They stripped me naked. One of them told me he would rape me. He drew a picture of a woman to my back and makes me stand in shameful position holding my buttocks." Most of the detainees said in the statements that they were stripped upon their arrival to Tier 1A, forced to wear women's underwear, and repeatedly humiliated in front of one another and American soldiers. They also described beatings and threats of death and sexual assault if they did not cooperate with U.S. interrogators. Hilas [a former detainee] also said he witnessed an Army translator having sex with a boy at the prison. He said the boy was between 15 and 18 years old. Someone hung sheets to block the view, but Hilas said he heard the boy's screams and climbed a door to get a better look. Hilas said he watched the assault and told investigators that it was documented by a female soldier taking pictures. Hilas told investigators that he asked Graner for the time one day because he wanted to pray. He said Graner cuffed him to the bars of a cell window and left him there for close to five hours, his feet dangling off the floor. Hilas also said he watched as Graner and others sodomized a detainee with a phosphoric light. "They tied him to the bed," Hilas said.
How ironic. The same day that the Pentagon issues a dismissive answer about urlLink the bombing of a wedding party in northern Iraq and the deaths 40 individuals, including 10 women and 15 children... urlLink new pictures appear showing a group of American assholes standing over the dead body of an Iraqi man. A man allegedly beaten to death by CIA or civilian interrogators in the showers (ABC News). The apologists say that our hard-working soldiers can't all be faulted for the egregious behavior of a small number. And they're right, of course. The vast majority of our soldiers are committed to serving their country in an exemplary fashion. But the disgusting behavior of a few brings us all down. And the continual message in all this: a widespread disregard for the general welfare of the Iraqis we liberated.
We're going to hit Toronto this weekend. Not because there's necessarily anything special going on in TO... more because I feel like I need a dose of sanity and an escape for a couple of days from the chaos of America. The sheer level of the disaster in Iraq, our President's arrogance, and the general mean-spiritedness which characterizes most of American political (and cultural) life often overwhelms me. What I have discovered is that a trip to Toronto allows, even if only briefly, an opportunity to take just one step out of that and-- for a couple days-- to look in on my home country and to look at the rest of the world in a different way. It's so odd to me that this is possible, since Canada is next door and bears the full brunt of the American media and cultural onslaught. But what I've come to appreciate about Canada is that even as America shapes Canada, Canada shapes its own unique identity. Quoting urlLink Soblo from an email exchange last week: nothing has reinforced the Canadian identity in the past few years like the Bush Administration. Seriously, just 4 years ago, a majority felt resigned to the fact that we'd be a part of the US within a few years. Now, it's unthinkable. My feeling of malaise has been growing and I know the signs. I've withdrawn from American newspapers and TV. I can't step away from the news but I've been seeking out a different way of looking at all of it. Where I live, I can get CBC Radio and TV. So, lately I've devoted my news consumption to Canada's media. And oddly enough, it's kind of soothing. Perhaps it's the sense of detachment. Maybe it's the desire to escape the mess we Americans have been making in the world, lately.
... Why All Is Right With the World: it's a sunny, pleasant weekday and I just finished a leisurely lunch outdoors. Apparently, I read urlLink Soblo's mind somehow because I decided to have a quality lunch so I could follow it up with a productive afternoon of reading-- which has been hard to come by lately, not only because of the standard onslaught of work, gym, etc., but also because what I've been eating has left me too jittery to concentrate properly. Driving to a conference this morning, I heard a piece about urlLink the Buffalo Commons on CBC's The Current. The idea has been around for a while. Essentially, it proposes allowing large chunks of the plains to revert to buffalo territory-- land that has been abandoned or isn't economically suitable for farming. I love the concept for its elegance, audacity and for the way in which it preserves a huge swatch of this continent in the way that I think it needs to be preserved. The devil is in the details and people like me have a tendency to wax lyrical about "ecosystems returned to natural rhythms" without really considering what it is these plans are suggesting. Nevertheless, I love the concept, just as I love the plains of North America, for all their subtle, rough-hewn beauty.
urlLink CNet News reports that Google is quietly testing a new email storage limit of 1 terabyte . Apparently only a small number of customers has access to the higher limit. I'm not one of them. The rest of us are having to make do with a mere 1 gigabyte of space. Google had already triggered a free mail war, of sorts. Yahoo is increasing its free mail storage limit to 100 MB. Lycos is promising a gigabyte of free space. Next, Hotmail will promise to give you a personal slave to carry all your mail in a wicker basket.
It was like standing in an echo chamber. My coffee request at the new Starbucks was transmitted from employee to employee... all along the chain. I listened to all of it, losing touch with the employee at the register. I was making sure it wouldn't turn into a game of telephone and morph into some kind of tall macchiato-type drink. I listened as New Starbucks Employee inquired how to make my beverage and Friendly Transplant From Another Store showed her. And I waited. It took nearly 5 minutes to produce the finished drink. In that amount of time, I could have strolled five blocks up the street to the Old Starbucks, ordered, and received my latte. And I would have gained a little exercise in the process. But I forgot my complaint once I reminded myself that I now have two coffee shops, including a Starbucks, within one block of my house. I may die of caffeine poisoning.
urlLink Josh Marshall works through the latest numbers , which show President Bush's support among Americans dropping yet again. He also offers an alternate view to those who are criticizing Kerry for not going after Bush more than he has. As polarized as America is, each candidate can expect about 40% of the vote without much effort. But those swing voters who comprise the remainder of the electorate seem to be making progressively more negative judgments about Bush, including his vaunted ability to wage the war on terror. Check out Marshall's piece if you get the chance.
It opened Friday. We went yesterday and are happy to report that it passes muster. In other words, it's like every other Starbucks we've been in up to now. No complaints. We christened it with a series of activities that will represent its utility for us, largely. We spent short periods of time reading books, doing some studying, listening to music, talking at a level that's designed not to be disturbing to others, and we sipped cups of fair trade coffee. Outlook... positive. I think this Starbucks chain is going to catch on someday. We also consumed "Kill Bill vol. 1" over the weekend, which neither of us had seen yet. Loved it... and now we're ready to see the sequel and some lucky Netflix customer is about to get a copy of Kill Bill because I've just returned the disc. The world spins on and on.

urlLink Back in January , I wrote that I smelled death in the Dean Campaign. After the events of the past two weeks, I've been itching to write the same words about the Bush Administration. I don't think someone trying to look at the political situation with a certain level of objectivity can say those words yet. But we're closer than we were even a couple of weeks ago. I'm not going to launch into a long timeline, nor will I recite a laundry list of Bush administation gaffes. You know them. And frankly, this administration has weathered attacks again and again, often with nothing more than it's sheer stubborn insistence that it's view of the world is right and everyone else's is wrong. But two weeks of intense reporting and attention focused on the treatment of Iraqi prisoners - 70-90% of whom are innocent of wrongdoing and the continued insurgency have greatly weakened the administration. And now, these developments. The head of the Iraqi Governing Council is dead this morning... the victim of a car bomb attack in Baghdad. urlLink Seymour Hersh reports in the New Yorker this week that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and others approved a plan encouraging physical coercion and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners. (The Defense Department says the story is "filled with error" and is "outlandish.") urlLink Newsweek reports today that a top White House lawyer questioned the validity of parts of the Geneva Conventions after 9/11. The lawyer reportedly wrote a memo to the President saying that the war on terror had made any strict limitations on how prisoners are questioned obsolete. The shortage of available troops is forcing the Pentagon to consider moving some of its soldiers from protecting South Korea... even as thousands of military families at home deal with duty time that has been extended again and again. I could offer several other examples, including rumors about the future of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and poll numbers showing a serious slide in support for Bush. But what I'm arguing is that, at least at this point, the bad news is piling up faster than the White House can shovel it away. And for Bush/Cheney, that's a huge problem. It's not insurmountable, and a signal event like capturing Osama bin Laden can change everything. But at this moment, for the first time, the Bush administration is facing the prospect of an out-of-control downward spin. And it's almost entirely the result of administration policies, decisions and actions.
Since we finally got around to seeing "Mean Girls" this week, that scratches one movie off the list, even as the list grows longer and longer. Most of the films I'd hardly classify as "must see." And then there's "Kill Bill, Vol 2" which has to wait until I see "Volume 1." I've heard so many people say that. Apparently, none of us went to see the first movie... and then we all discovered it was good and we've had to wait for the DVD. Speaking of which, for you Netflix subscribers in the long cue for Kill Bill, I apologize. I'm one of the Netflix bunch with a Kill Bill disc in my possession. I've had it for more than two weeks. I've been busy . Uh-huh. Netflix probably has to order 1,000 extra copies of blockbuster movies just because of slowpokes like me. I'm getting excited for "The Day After Tomorrow." Not because it will be any good. I'm sure it probably won't. But I derive a great deal of enjoyment out of the destruction of major cities. I even watched that piece of drek from NBC called "10.5." I wanted to see Los Angeles and much of California drop into the ocean. Serves them right, those annoying fuckers . Well, the miniseries was so awful, I could taste metal. And the much-awaited destruction of LA amounted to a two second shot of downtown collapsing - the same shot from the promos. And between the movie and the relentless "Friends" finale promos, there was so much crying that condensation formed on my screen. Most of the movies on the must see list this month will probably disappoint. Heck, I'd be happy to watch "Fog of War" again. I thought it was a great documentary. And just yesterday, I was struck by a craving to see "Best in Show" again. But, I'll still probably shell out $9 to see Hellboy. It buys me a ticket to free complaining, right?
Thursday afternoon, lately, has become the What The Fuck!?!? Day . It's the point in the week when you realize just exactly how much you've not accomplished off of your to-do list for the week; the point where you're suddenly aware of the rapidly closing window of opportunity to check off any of those other boxes on the list. I think the perfect antidote to this recurring problem is to begin a mid- to high-level injection of alcohol into one's system. I plan to begin in approximately 30 minutes. Join me, boys, and let's sip our way into the weekend.
My friend Rick passes along this hapless headline: Study reports frozen sperm as good as fresh
Sitting at an outdoor cafe yesterday for my 4 hour lunch/meeting, I was struck with this realization: there were literally hundreds of people around us, sipping beverages, chatting, reading, people-watching. Do these people work? And if they do, how can I get a job like theirs? Actually, I have a pretty relaxed job. A good thing because I've always had a pretty relaxed attitude toward authority, work "hours", and carefully laid out and politically fractious org charts. My approach has always been along the following lines: if I have an idea and it's good, then let's get the right team together to do it and hang the org chart. The prime criteria is performance. I'm this odd mix of careful diplomat and bull-in-china-closet. My career history has been with a few organizations that adhere to that kind of ethic. In two cases, when that ethic disappeared and the workplace became more regimented and hierarchical, I left. It took me several years to piece together circumstances and situations... to understand that this was a driving force behind my style as an employee and eventually, as a manager. In the past two years, I've had some great job offers come my way-- big salary increases, cool cities. But I've turned them down because the organizations making the offer have been anything but the kind of place where I could make a difference. All because a couple years ago, a career coach pointed out to me this aspect of my personality and suggested I think hard about job offers in light of that. I was talking to an entrepreneur friend of mine the other day, explaining this realization and how it now shapes the career decisions I make. He looked at me, paused, and said, "Ok, you're entering management now. What happens five years from now when some bright up-and-comer shows up with a lot of ideas - some of them not so great, but many of them quite good? Will you reach down to him or her the same way your mentors at all these jobs have reached down to you? Or will you become a part of the problem?" Good question.
Lunch with the boss turned into a 4 hour chat fest... a fierce one on one exchange of views, laughs, gossip. Another reminder why I work there.
From urlLink Juan Cole : Taguba and Cambone Clash on Prison Torture Responsibility No one is a better friend to historians than a military or civilian official who doesn't know he is supposed to lie about some things. The WP reports, "Taguba said that when control of the prison was turned over to military intelligence officials, they had authority over the military police who were guarding prisoners. But Stephen Cambone, the Pentagon's undersecretary for intelligence, said that was incorrect, that authority for the handling of detainees had remained with the MPs." What is going on here is that Taguba is giving an honest and faithful account of what happened. He says that the militiary intelligence guys got command control of the MPs. Cambone knows that this is against army regulations and should be denied, not openly admitted. Either way, Taguba is right that this is what happened.
If there's any music show that most consistently soothes the savage beast that rages within me... it's urlLink The Blue Room on BBC Radio 1. I never miss a show anymore and I've been known to listen to some shows twice over the course of the 7 days in which the BBC makes each edition available. I can read and write with dance music going off at high decibels in my head... but the anti-frenetic pace of the music and the hosts is almost enough to turn me into a Type B personality. Not likely, but dare to dream, right? Props to urlLink Jockohomo for bringing this show to my attention a couple years ago.
I sat on one of those treasured invitations to sign up for Google Mail for some time before finally setting it up this weekend. GMail, as it's known, has been getting lots of attention in its beta phase, for a few reasons: Google is going public; we're fascinated with Google right now; the mail service offers some new approaches to mail handling; and, oh yes, there's been a great deal of handwringing about privacy because of Google's plan to place ads along the side of your browser based on the content of your email message. More on that later. GMail is different. The interface is simple, much like the renowned Google search page. It's free, and Google smartly gives you a gigabyte of space for your mail. That's a lot of space, compared to the miserly 2 MB you get from other free providers like Hotmail. Those of us with Hotmail or Yahoo accounts always have one eye on the little meter showing us how much space we have left. Of course, you can get more space, but it will cost you. So GMail blows the roof off of this artificial limitation, acknowledging that we get a lot of mail and we also get large attachments. GMail also gives you that space for another reason. It wants you to save your mail rather than deleting most of it and squirreling it away in folders where you can't remember it. I won't go into great detail on this, but I think you understand the value of keeping mail, "pasting" labels to it and then using the smart Google search engine to find what you're looking for. It's probably the way programs like Outlook will handle mail in the not-too-distant future. And it is somewhat similar to the new ways of managing, storing and searching for content that we'll see in the next generation of Windows. Alright, enough of that. Here's what I think: I like it a lot. The interface is easy to work with, it's smart - just like you'd expect Google's Mail to be, and I like being able to keep a large volume of mail. Is GMail going to become my main account? No. My work email and most of my email correspondence flows through Outlook and that's the way I want it to be, so I can archive it. Yes, GMail archives stuff in your giant gigabyte-sized bin. But, GMail isn't compatible with any email software right now. And that limits its usefulness. Still, I've found good uses for the account. I have one Hotmail account that serves as the receptacle for the dozens of email newsletters I subscribe to, and all non-work, personal business. That stuff, I've been transferring to GMail, where I have more space for all of it. Only time will tell how much I use the search function to look at the stuff I'm archiving. Now, to the privacy issue. Yes, sometimes when I open a piece of email, a few small ads appear on the right-hand side of the screen. Truth be told, I don't look at them and I don't even see them. I'm blind to them, in the same way that I'm blind to the little ads on the Google search results page. Maybe I'd be more concerned if I was using the account for lots of private email. But I can't get worked up about some giant computer parsing my email newsletters from CNet or email for weblog readers to send me an ad for a new PC. Who cares. The question now is whether GMail will force other providers like Yahoo and Hotmail to dramatically increase the space available to users. The other question is whether GMail will take the next step to allow integration into email software. For now, though, it's my newest software toy.
urlLink The eye is on me. This is cool and all, but whenever I walk away from my monitor, it follows me. The Evil Eye!!!! by the way, thanks, urlLink Myke , for enduring my feeble sense of humor. Yes, I'm back... and yes, it's for good.
One eventually tires of trying to find the right words to express how one feels about the following statement from this Total Boob: WASHINGTON urlLink (Reuters) - As others condemned the reported abuse of Iraqi prisoners, U.S. Sen. James Inhofe on Tuesday expressed outrage at the worldwide outrage over the treatment by American soldiers of those he called "terrorists" and "murderers." "I'm probably not the only one up at this table that is more outraged by the outrage than we are by the treatment," the Oklahoma Republican said at a U.S. Senate hearing probing the scandal. "These prisoners, you know they're not there for traffic violations," Inhofe said. "If they're in cellblock 1-A or 1-B, these prisoners, they're murderers, they're terrorists, they're insurgents. Many of them probably have American blood on their hands and here we're so concerned about the treatment of those individuals." Coalition military intelligence officers estimated that about 70 percent to 90 percent of the thousands of prisoners detained in Iraq had been "arrested by mistake," according to a report by Red Cross given to the Bush administration last year and leaked this week. The report also said the mistreatment of prisoners apparently tolerated by U.S. and other coalition forces in Iraq involved widespread abuse that was "in some cases tantamount to torture." In heated remarks at odds with others on the Senate committee who took aim at the U.S. military's handling of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad, Inhofe said that American sympathies should lie with U.S. troops. "I am also outraged that we have so many humanitarian do-gooders right now crawling all over these prisons looking for human rights violations, while our troops, our heroes are fighting and dying," he said. Inhofe, who visited Iraq in March, is described on his senatorial Web site as a leading conservative voice in the Senate, advocating "common sense Oklahoma values including less government, less regulation, lower taxes, fiscal responsibility and a strong national defense."
I'm not going to pretend that many of us have the time to read a 53 page report - at least one that's not for work or school. But if you have some time... read or skim through urlLink the report Antonio Taguba wrote after his investigation of prisoner abuse in Iraq. It's stomach-turning.
I'm still trying to figure out how to write a weblog again after being away for so long... but thanks to urlLink you and urlLink you and a few non-weblogger readers for the kind welcome back. I like the idea of coming full circle... back to the original home for this weblog... where it started 4 years ago. So... here's to a new beginning and the old home becomes the permanent new one.
My friend Drew emailed today, saying he and his boyfriend are going to Toronto for Memorial Day Weekend. "And what about you?" he asked. I will be in TO for Pride at the end of June. That is decided. What happens at the end of this month is up in the air. But it would be fun to have a weekend in the city. Spring has been cold and dreary, overall, and the result is that I'm still acting as though it's early spring, when -- in fact -- summer is nearly upon us. The result of that result: no plans made for summer vacation, travel, etc. One exception: Toronto Pride. Contrast my lack of planning with my friend Chris, who wrote the following last week: "David and I are going to Montreal for Christmas and we've decided to spend a couple days in Toronto. What do you recommend for hotels?" This is Chris, all the way. It's early May and he's booking for December. There's nothing necessarily wrong with my approach, except that if I don't get my act together soon, most of the summer will be gone before I even plan one little getaway.
Here it is... courtesy of urlLink Josh Marshall ... the urlLink ICRC report on prisoner abuse . The Wall Street Journal broke the story in its Monday issue that the Red Cross had been complaining about torture and mistreatment-- often to the highest levels of the military-- since last year. Antonio Taguba testifies today... and his testimony will be particularly interesting, particularly because his higher-ups want to portray the torture as the actions of a few soldiers. It's increasingly apparent that's not the case.
Ok one more techie thing... since I've been in the mood for most of the day-- checking out new phones, new PDA's, etc. Here is a urlLink new DVR from Sony that has a terabyte of storage and seven TV tuners inside. Yes, assuming that you could find seven shows on at the same time that you would actually want to watch, this device has the capacity to record them. A terabyte sounds ridiculous, but frankly, in the world of HDTV, you're going to need about that much space to record shows in HD and still have something close to about 50 hours of capacity to work with. Yes, this is a whole different scale. As usual, this device is only to be available in Japan and may never make it here. But whatever the case, we're not far from having digital video recorders like this, since the technology is forcing this kind of capacity.

I've been on a quest for weeks now to find a good RSS news reader. I do a lot of traveling around the web to read the stories and weblogs I'm interested in. My weblog blogroll alone is a mile long, as you can plainly see. But I've been trying to aggregate a great deal of that content in one place to save some time. There are at least a couple dozen programs that pull together content from news sites and weblogs, using RSS feeds. The problem is that a lot of them are annoying to use. But, I can announce that after searching and testing all kinds of readers-- from Aggreg8 to FeedDemon to Radio Userland-- I've found one that I really like: urlLink Newsgator . It integrates into Microsoft Outlook seamlessly, so you already have a good interface for looking at the feeds. And adding feeds is easy. There's even a wizard to help you find the RSS content you want. It costs money, but you get a couple of weeks to check it out before you have to plunk down cash. I won't say anything more about this; this isn't a techie weblog. But if you're looking for a good RSS reader and you use Outlook, NewsGator might be an option.
hmmm... seems a somewhat auspicious day to make a return to this little business of weblogging after a hiatus. Quiet day... late morning in bed, a little of this and a little of that, then up, showered, to brunch. The bf is taking his mom out today so i'm home alone now, with a little cleaning on the agenda, some laundry, and a call home to Mom. Hello again, people.
Go figure.
Thanks for the notes about the Canadian elections... interesting stuff from Canadians as well as others. We'll get back to normal here later today or tomorrow.
The elections are over. And now, please cue the remarkably bad analysis. Remarkably bad might be a bit much, although Andrew Coyne's shift from Conservative Triumphalism on Saturday to urlLink Bitter Old Crone this morning in the National Post marks one edge of the Lunatic Fringe. The urlLink Globe and Mail also goes a bit too far, in my opinion... and seems too dire by a touch in its assessment of what this election will mean for westerners, for instance. Make no mistake, there are deep divisions, but perhaps we shouldn't jump to the conclusion that these will end Canada As We Know It. The Canadian media made a couple of errors that the American media has made in assessing voter attitudes and intent. First, there was a lack of sense about voter behavior and the very simple tendency of angry voters to simmer down and think more carefully and strategically when stationed in the booth with a ballot in front of them. Second, media discovered, to their dismay, that voters failed to stick to the simple script they had written for this election: the voters are mad as hell and not going to take it anymore. Well, in fact, that was not the case. Voters were, and are, angry and pissy, but their response has been punishment, not blind rage. Paul Martin has a mandate, even though he and his party now enter a phase of minority rule. The mandate is, perhaps, not the traditional affirmation from voters. But, in fact, 39% of voters have turned to the Liberal party... and more than half of voters have allied themselves with the center-left policies of the Liberal and New Democratic parties, not to mention the considerable support for the Bloc in Quebec. Part of this mandate is to continue those center-left policies, yes. But part of that mandate is also an expectation that the Liberals will keep their promises and clean up their act. This is punishment, but it's kind of like the judgment a parent would pass on a child: you can be forgiven, but there will be consequences. Two key themes, then, in my opinion: punishment, but ultimately, acceptance of the Liberals. It might be a grudging acceptance in the absence of an acceptable alternative, but acceptance is what it is. Politics isn't often pretty and this victory is a perfect example. The other theme is the repudiation of Stephen Harper's Conservatives. Not for all time, perhaps. But despite an election called just weeks after the party merger, voters gave Harper a chance and then turned away from him to return, largely, to the center-left. Some of this was because of negative advertising. Some of this was because of uncertainty. But it was also because Harper was unable or unwilling to present a clear, unambiguous vision for Canada. When he did talk vision, Liberals accused him of a secret agenda. Why did the charge stick? Because Harper's statements and careful reporting seemed to give credence to that view. It was also because Harper's desire to present a moderate face to Canadian voters was difficult to sustain in his stitched-together coalition as other members of his party stepped forward with more extreme views about abortion and gay rights, among other issues. Issues like the long-term prospects for Liberals in the West, and Canadians' concerns about democracy aren't dire. But that's not to say they don't exist and that they don't need to be addressed. What is called for is a sense of proportion. And now, let's look ahead to a minority government for Canada. The experience of minority government has been positive, in part. Maybe that will be the case this time. It will certainly be interesting.
Harper is expected to appear momentarily to speak to supporters in Calgary and concede the election to the Liberals.
There are still votes to be counted and at this point it looks as though about 30 seats are still not locked in yet... but we can definitely point to a Liberal minority government, with Jack Layton (woohoo!) and the NDP serving as the linchpin in the next Parliament. At the moment, he's speaking at his party's event in Toronto, with mixed emotions no doubt since his wife, Olivia Chow, lost her chance to go to Ottawa, representing the Trinity-Spadina region. A marvelous evening for the NDP with a gain of 8 seats and 6.5 percentage points. Layton on the Liberals: "We will hold them to" their promises. "We will find how interesting Paul Martin finds the idea of proportional representation." The Bloc looks to walk away with 56 seats... another thrilling win for the Bloc in Quebec.
CTV News now predicts a Liberal minority government.
CBC News predicts a Liberal minority government.
We're, of course, looking at very early results coming in from Ontario and so the numbers aren't as important at the moment, but what we must note is the strong showing the Liberals are enjoying right out of the gate in Ontario. The held on in Atlantic Canada and now in Ontario, the results are -- at first blush-- better than one might have predicted. Let's not get carried away, but it's an early and potentially hopeful sign.
It's worth noting, since I skipped over it the first time around in analyzing the Atlantic results: The NDP has performed quite well, gaining 6 percentage points in the Atlantic region. This result didn't translate into more seats, but it is worth noting.
Lest I forget, an important symbolic in the riding of Kings-Hants for Scott Brison, who left the Progressive Conservatives for the Liberals after the merger. Brison is openly gay, but has shown the ability to serve his constituents well... and despite some hard feelings in his riding, he has achieved a solid victory. Here's a urlLink CBC News backgrounder on Brison .
No results from Fredericton yet and no one seems to be sure why, but otherwise, Atlantic Canada is delivering stronger results for the Liberals than in 2000. The Conservatives are performing less well and the NDP is either elected in, or leading in, 4 ridings. The analysts on CBC and CTV are focusing mainly on perception of the new Conservatives and connections to the old Alliance party, which aren't a big help in Atlantic Canada.
While we're awaiting the early results from the Atlantic provinces... check out this prediction of a fundamental, and most likely, disturbing change for Canada predicted by the urlLink National Post's Andrew Coyne on Saturday. A good deal of it is social conservative utopianism and, thus, can be dismissed. But it's just scary enough that it's worth paying attention to.
Turnout has been heavy throughout the day, according to reports from CBC News and Global News Toronto. There have been more than 1.2 million votes cast in advance of today's elections, as well. Global News Toronto is projecting 57 seats for the Liberals and 40 for the Conservatives in Ontario, based on the latest poll results. What do the poll results of the past few days mean when voter turnout is much higher than expected-- as appears to be the case? Good question and one area of interest as we prepare for election returns, which begin on the east coast in about an hour.
I'm all rested from Toronto Pride now and ready to go with results from the Canadian federal elections. Live coverage begins here at 7pm... and will continue until we achieve some clarity with the results. urlLink
If you think Pride is about much more than horrifying images of half-naked, half drunk, half-stoned, staggering individuals... then you haven't actually been to a Pride event. Now, now, it's not that bad. It is about more than that, and only a reasonably small number of individuals were half-drunk or stoned. OK, that's not quite true. Still, Pride in Toronto was, once again, a happy romp with several hundred thousand people who have one thing-- and often, only one thing-- in common. It's the one time of year I'm exposed to that many gay and lesbian people, and even though it's a bit much, it's also an educational experience and-- not to get all sappy and shit, but you can feel this odd sense of unity with all those people. What you're wearing doesn't matter. Where you're pierced doesn't matter. What you think about politics or art or books doesn't matter. At least it doesn't for a couple of days when everybody can come together, have a good time and feel some sense of unity, however fleeting. There was a distinct political element to Pride this year... more so than last year. Marriage remains a major issue, but this year, many Americans and Canadians shared the desire to put allies into positions of power or keep them there. There were Democratic organizers there trying to register Americans for the elections. And Canada's elections loomed large, what with all the uncertainty about the outcome, and a strong opposition to Stephen Harper. In America, the point is to kick Bush out. In Canada, it's to keep Harper from getting in. The Liberal party handed out "Stop Harper" buttons... and that seemed to be the only message the Grits had for Gay and Lesbian Canadians yesterday. Nothing very forward-looking about that. The NDP contigent, with urlLink Olivia Chow in front, presented probably the most positive pro-gay message. Certainly better than the Conservatives. Two Blue candidates rode through the parade, accompanied by a chorus of boos, basically begging for votes because they support same-sex marriage, even though their party doesn't. More about politics in a separate post, yet to come. Non-gay type notes from the weekend: urlLink Digital radio is alive and strong in Toronto. Most stations are already transmitting in the new digital spectrum, although one of my personal favorites - urlLink Flow 93.5 - isn't. Neither, apparently, is the CBC/SRC channel, with the four CBC networks. The CBC case seems to be a technical problem.
Toronto Pride is this weekend. It's not going to be warm, but there's a decent chance it will be sunny and so it will be reasonably pleasant. It'll also be a good weekend to take Canada's pulse on what is almost certain to be a very close election. I'm no expert, so I'm accepting the consensus that what we'll see next is a minority government, with the possibility that the Liberals and NDP might be able to win enough seats together to lead. Who knows about that second part. Martin has already said that the party winning the most seats should have first chance at forming a government. Well, I'm not going to dwell on this kind of speculation. It's not my strong suit. It's like trying to write your dissertation in your second language. You might be able to do it, but it ain't easy. The weekend won't be busy. Buddies features comedians at "Homo Night in Canada" tonight, with dancing to follow. We'll be there for that. There's the parade on Sunday. And in between... lots of people-watching, perhaps a visit to the Royal Ontario Museum, maybe the CBC Museum (I may have to go there by myself). My boyfriend has a group of deaf friends who meet the last Friday night of every month at Timothy's on Church St, so we'll hang out there for a while tonight. We're also taking a couple of good books. We might see a movie. I refuse to get into all the shit that goes along with Pride. We should take a dog, just in case any other urlLink wackos reach TO with a carload of guns .
It's not in today's paper, but if you're lucky, the urlLink Globe and Mail website will still have the latest picture of a party leader eating ice cream. Today, it's Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe. mmmm. Previously featured... Conservative party leader Stephen Harper and PM Paul Martin, both munching on cones. Unless I missed it, we await a photo of NDP leader Jack Layton peering from behind a mountain of ice cream. Green Party leader Jim Harris is demanding equal time. Vanilla, please.
Four days to the federal elections and among us political junkies, there's a growing sense of excitement. At this point, it's likely to be close and it's likely to result in a minority government. There are lots of studies about how minority governments behave and whether they last and whether they accomplish much, but for pure intrigue, you can't beat them. If I lived in Canada, I would be somewhere between Liberal and NDP in my political orientation. So my personal interest lies in seeing that kind of combination. The Alberta Health Care Flap -- is it a Flap? Yes-- has left the Conservatives looking a little stupid. Alberta's Premier had planned to release a new health plan two days after the elections, a plan that was likely to include provisions for greater private service, etc. Basically, a major reform that the Premier had already said would likely violate the Canada Health Act, and one that voters wouldn't find out about until after they had cast their ballots. After a Liberal outcry, Premier Ralph Klein promised he would reveal the full plan yesterday. But his government gave only partial details of the plan. (The Bush administration is really good at that: promising full disclosure and revealing almost nothing.) So, the story morphed into "Klein fails to reveal full plans for Medicare." And, indeed, that's the play it got last night, and is still getting urlLink this morning . urlLink Soblo thinks this controversy over Alberta health care reforms could be the undoing of Stephen Harper. He's more knowledgeable than I am about Canadian politics - it may well be. I watched Paul Martin's appearance on CBC last night. I saw it on the Halifax feed so I could go to bed earlier, there being few other reasons to watch CBC Halifax. Overweight Canadians expressed their thoughts about the issues and flailed helplessly at the Prime Minister, who displayed his usual verbal dishevelment. A good finance minister doesn't necessarily make for a good Prime Minister. But at this point, voters seem more concerned about how Stephen Harper would be as a leader. And more and more of them seem to conclude that he wouldn't be that good.
WASHINGTON, June 22 — The White House this afternoon released a stack of internal documents on the treatment of war prisoners to back up President Bush's declaration hours earlier that torture is "not part of our soul." Consider it more of a hobby...
A lot of spinning going on among Liberals and Conservatives over the new Ipsos-Reid poll showing a 6% Liberal lead. The rejoinder from the C's- the real vote is on Monday- is barely worth a "nice try." It may be the Liberals are closer to the mark in saying this is the result of Ontarians giving the party a second look. Here's what I would do if I was running things over at the NDP. I would continue to play up the importance of the NDP being a key player in the next government, whether it's minority Conservative or Liberal. I would continue to deliver a few good punches at Paul Martin. But I would allow for a subtle tilt toward the Liberals. Nothing too apparent, just aiming a few more of my guns at the Conservatives in Ontario now that they're down a little. Because for the NDP, the point is to be a key part of the next government. And that's really only possible, and palatable, if it's a minority Liberal government. I think Layton is already starting to do this... or at least that's how I interpret some of his actions over the past 24 hours.
My National Post today says that "Harper Widens Seat Lead." I'm not too sure about this. I've not seen his seat. But more seriously, there's the latest Ipsos-Reid poll for CTV and the Globe and Mail showing the Liberals ahead by six points. urlLink Soblo says this puts the Liberals and new-fangled Tories essentially back where they started a few weeks ago. So what's with the seats? The National Post and Montreal Gazette, sister papers, say 126 Conservative seats, 95 Liberals, 60 for the Bloc and 27 NDP. The Globe and Mail extrapolates based on its new poll: 110 seats each for L and C. The papers report most of the country has decided, except for Ontarians, which is interesting; maybe they're trying to decide just how angry they are at the Liberals, and just how concerned they might be about a Harper government. Last month, I said I wasn't going to concentrate too much on polls. But frankly, in a race this close and this uncertain, the polls can provide good snapshots of how people are agonizing over choices. If predictions come true, there will be a low turnout, and that only increases uncertainty. And there are 5 more days of politicking before Monday's elections. That's plenty of time for another stupid Conservative move - child porn, for instance - or another Liberal gaffe. We will see. I don't want Harper, or his hardened helmet of hair, running the show. In the past few days, I've felt cautious optimism.
Via urlLink Soblo , a new poll from urlLink SES Research that appears to show a slight increase in support for the Liberals and the expense of Stephen Harper. The poll follows the release of a new ad from the Grits tying Harper to former PM Brian Mulroney. Soblo brought it to my attention and I'll bow to his smart analysis that it's about time that someone make that connection. Mulroney is cherished like smallpox. I just saw the ad and it's good. I think this is a turning point for the Liberals, potentially. But it's so close that the next week will be fascinating, and more negative than ever. The poll shows an increase in support for the NDP, which is interesting. I still wonder how strong the support is for Layton. He's trying to hold it together but there's a segment of NDP voters which could leach away to the Liberals. My mind is mush right now but I'll likely go on and on about all of this next week.
It got mention on urlLink Here and Now yesterday... and here he is: urlLink Toronto Mayor David Miller attired in leather and apparently quite enjoying himself as he proclaims that Toronto Pride "should be publicized all over North America." On his Pride day fashion strategy: "I'll be wearing clothes." Good move.
Good article from Lockergnome's Chris Pirillo on why urlLink you should say goodbye to Internet Explorer . Yes, there are some webpages that are written specifically for IE; and yes, it's good to fire up IE every once in a while for Windows Update. Otherwise, take Pirillo's advice (and mine, and urlLink Madlife's ) and get urlLink Firefox . Pirillo presents all the security and other reasons why Firefox consistently outranks other browsers. But I've been using it since it was a baby because of its combination of power, speed, simplicity and robustness. You just can't beat it.
I've not been finding the time I need to keep up with the weblog in the past week. Sorry about this. It's not for lack of things to talk about. There's plenty to talk about. It's finding the time to engage the keyboard. That necessary time has been in short supply. I've been off in a variety of different directions, as is usually the case with me. I've been writing a series of long "think pieces" for work on a range of strategic issues. So at the end of the day, I've not had much desire to spend any more time typing and proofreading than I already have. I've reached what I'll call "Mansbridge Overload" on the Canadian federal elections. I'm still consuming about an hour a day of Canadian campaign news, above and beyond my regular diet of Canadian bacon - The World at Six, Cross Country Checkup, election TV specials on CBC, the Globe and Mail, National Post... and tonight, the English Leadership Debate. But, I've never been a big fan of Peter Mansbridge on The National. I've taken to TiVoing the show and skipping through his parts. I thought I would hate the whole Election Bus thing that CBC and the other networks are using to promote themselves. And I do. It's a big fat gimmick, except that the dude on the CBC bus is kind of cool. Mark Kelley, and Tod Maffin on Radio, have produced some really nice, quirky pieces exploring the Canadian hinterland and assessing the views of the electorate. They remind me of the pieces the American network correspondents do every four years when they discover that people actually live, however strangely, in flyover country. Except, American reports usually depict midwesterners as kindly rubes. A much larger proportion of the Canadian population lives in urban areas. But still, I haven't seen Canadian TV trying to do much more than show the quaintness of rural life and figure out what those people care about. By the way... you can read the official Bus weblog urlLink here . While I'm picking favorites, I'll also mention "Spinoff." It's a regular series of off-beat election reports. Most of it is excellent, some of it is quite funny. I don't think there are web archives of the program (CBC's Official Web Strategy places less emphasis on web-streaming than the BBC, for instance) but you can listen live online on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11:45am ET on any of the CBC Radio One ET streams. Any online CBC station elsewhere in the country also runs it at 11:45am local time. Don't talk to me about Newfoundland Time.
A week of never-ending work gives way to a calm and quiet Friday. The runaway schedule was not without its casualties. The Battle of Algiers was showing for a week at the cinema and has now closed, one day before I had time to see it. Hello, Netflix! Other than that, not much missed, despite the busy week. I even found a way to listen to urlLink Cross Country Checkup a day later and 1.4x faster than real time, thanks to the new Windows Media 10. I've not written about Canadian politics all week, but as with American politics, it's always there waiting for you if you've missed it for a few days. It's been an interesting week with backlash over Liberal plants running around goading Stephen Harper and now Harper's semi-positive statements about gays. Well, how positive is this? Mr. Harper dodged repeated questions on Charter rights for homosexuals, saying at one campaign stop that the issue "is not part of my election campaign. "What consenting adults do is their own business, and it's not up to me to comment on it one way or another, and it's not what people want from government officials." When he was pushed on the issue at a press conference, a crowd of Conservative supporters jeered the reporters. from today's urlLink Globe and Mail . Yes, so super encouraging. No one will be snowed by that. The social issues have the potential to trip up the Conservative campaign and that's all Liberals want right now... is to slow or stop the momentum. Conservatives are also starting to get a little cocky, talking more and more about a majority government and if there's anything you don't want to do, it's get too far ahead of where Canadian voters are. And right now, they think Conservatives are neck and neck. A quiet weekend. We're going on a little roadtrip tomorrow so I can indulge my whim and buy a urlLink DAB radio . Ok, so it's not life-changing, but nothing like having a new toy!
This report from today's Wall Street Journal is worth reading and since it's only available to subscribers, I've reprinted without permission: Pentagon Report Set Framework For Use of Torture Security or Legal Factors Could Trump Restrictions, Memo to Rumsfeld Argued By JESS BRAVIN Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL June 7, 2004; Page A1 Bush administration lawyers contended last year that the president wasn't bound by laws prohibiting torture and that government agents who might torture prisoners at his direction couldn't be prosecuted by the Justice Department. The advice was part of a classified report on interrogation methods prepared for Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld after commanders at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, complained in late 2002 that with conventional methods they weren't getting enough information from prisoners. The report outlined U.S. laws and international treaties forbidding torture, and why those restrictions might be overcome by national-security considerations or legal technicalities. In a March 6, 2003, draft of the report reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, passages were deleted as was an attachment listing specific interrogation techniques and whether Mr. Rumsfeld himself or other officials must grant permission before they could be used. The complete draft document was classified "secret" by Mr. Rumsfeld and scheduled for declassification in 2013. The draft report, which exceeds 100 pages, deals with a range of legal issues related to interrogations, offering definitions of the degree of pain or psychological manipulation that could be considered lawful. But at its core is an exceptional argument that because nothing is more important than "obtaining intelligence vital to the protection of untold thousands of American citizens," normal strictures on torture might not apply. The president, despite domestic and international laws constraining the use of torture, has the authority as commander in chief to approve almost any physical or psychological actions during interrogation, up to and including torture, the report argued. Civilian or military personnel accused of torture or other war crimes have several potential defenses, including the "necessity" of using such methods to extract information to head off an attack, or "superior orders," sometimes known as the Nuremberg defense: namely that the accused was acting pursuant to an order and, as the Nuremberg tribunal put it, no "moral choice was in fact possible." According to Bush administration officials, the report was compiled by a working group appointed by the Defense Department's general counsel, William J. Haynes II. Air Force General Counsel Mary Walker headed the group, which comprised top civilian and uniformed lawyers from each military branch and consulted with the Justice Department, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Defense Intelligence Agency and other intelligence agencies. It isn't known if President Bush has ever seen the report. A Pentagon official said some military lawyers involved objected to some of the proposed interrogation methods as "different than what our people had been trained to do under the Geneva Conventions," but those lawyers ultimately signed on to the final report in April 2003, shortly after the war in Iraq began. The Journal hasn't seen the full final report, but people familiar with it say there were few substantial changes in legal analysis between the draft and final versions. A military lawyer who helped prepare the report said that political appointees heading the working group sought to assign to the president virtually unlimited authority on matters of torture -- to assert "presidential power at its absolute apex," the lawyer said. Although career military lawyers were uncomfortable with that conclusion, the military lawyer said they focused their efforts on reining in the more extreme interrogation methods, rather than challenging the constitutional powers that administration lawyers were saying President Bush could claim. The Pentagon disclosed last month that the working group had been assembled to review interrogation policies after intelligence officials in Guantanamo reported frustration in extracting information from prisoners. At a news conference last week, Gen. James T. Hill, who oversees the offshore prison at Guantanamo as head of the U.S. Southern Command, said the working group sought to identify "what is legal and consistent with not only Geneva [but] ... what is right for our soldiers." He said Guantanamo is "a professional, humane detention and interrogation operation ... bounded by law and guided by the American spirit." Gen. Hill said Mr. Rumsfeld gave him the final set of approved interrogation techniques on April 16, 2003. Four of the methods require the defense secretary's approval, he said, and those methods had been used on two prisoners. He said interrogators had stopped short of using all the methods lawyers had approved. It remains unclear what actions U.S. officials took as a result of the legal advice. Critics who have seen the draft report said it undercuts the administration's claims that it recognized a duty to treat prisoners humanely. The "claim that the president's commander-in-chief power includes the authority to use torture should be unheard of in this day and age," said Michael Ratner, president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, a New York advocacy group that has filed lawsuits against U.S. detention policies. "Can one imagine the reaction if those on trial for atrocities in the former Yugoslavia had tried this defense?" Following scattered reports last year of harsh interrogation techniques used by the U.S. overseas, Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, wrote to National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice asking for clarification. The response came in June 2003 from Mr. Haynes, who wrote that the U.S. was obliged to conduct interrogations "consistent with" the 1994 international Convention Against Torture and the federal Torture Statute enacted to implement the convention outside the U.S. The U.S. "does not permit, tolerate or condone any such torture by its employees under any circumstances," Mr. Haynes wrote. The U.S. also followed its legal duty, required by the torture convention, "to prevent other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture," he wrote. The U.S. position is that domestic criminal laws and the Constitution's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments already met the Convention Against Torture's requirements within U.S. territory. The Convention Against Torture was proposed in 1984 by the United Nations General Assembly and was ratified by the U.S. in 1994. It states that "no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture," and that orders from superiors "may not be invoked as a justification of torture." That prohibition was reaffirmed after the Sept. 11 attacks by the U.N. panel that oversees the treaty, the Committee Against Torture, and the March 2003 report acknowledged that "other nations and international bodies may take a more restrictive view" of permissible interrogation methods than did the Bush administration. The report then offers a series of legal justifications for limiting or disregarding antitorture laws and proposed legal defenses that government officials could use if they were accused of torture. A military official who helped prepare the report said it came after frustrated Guantanamo interrogators had begun trying unorthodox methods on recalcitrant prisoners. "We'd been at this for a year-plus and got nothing out of them" so officials concluded "we need to have a less-cramped view of what torture is and is not." The official said, "People were trying like hell how to ratchet up the pressure," and used techniques that ranged from drawing on prisoners' bodies and placing women's underwear on prisoners heads -- a practice that later reappeared in the Abu Ghraib prison -- to telling subjects, "I'm on the line with somebody in Yemen and he's in a room with your family and a grenade that's going to pop unless you talk." Senior officers at Guantanamo requested a "rethinking of the whole approach to defending your country when you have an enemy that does not follow the rules," the official said. Rather than license torture, this official said that the report helped rein in more "assertive" approaches. Methods now used at Guantanamo include limiting prisoners' food, denying them clothing, subjecting them to body-cavity searches, depriving them of sleep for as much as 96 hours and shackling them in so-called stress positions, a military-intelligence official said. Although the interrogators consider the methods to be humiliating and unpleasant, they don't view them as torture, the official said. The working-group report elaborated the Bush administration's view that the president has virtually unlimited power to wage war as he sees fit, and neither Congress, the courts nor international law can interfere. It concluded that neither the president nor anyone following his instructions was bound by the federal Torture Statute, which makes it a crime for Americans working for the government overseas to commit or attempt torture, defined as any act intended to "inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering." Punishment is up to 20 years imprisonment, or a death sentence or life imprisonment if the victim dies. "In order to respect the president's inherent constitutional authority to manage a military campaign ... (the prohibition against torture) must be construed as inapplicable to interrogations undertaken pursuant to his commander-in chief authority," the report asserted. (The parenthetical comment is in the original document.) The Justice Department "concluded that it could not bring a criminal prosecution against a defendant who had acted pursuant to an exercise of the president's constitutional power," the report said. Citing confidential Justice Department opinions drafted after Sept. 11, 2001, the report advised that the executive branch of the government had "sweeping" powers to act as it sees fit because "national security decisions require the unity in purpose and energy in action that characterize the presidency rather than Congress." The lawyers concluded that the Torture Statute applied to Afghanistan but not Guantanamo, because the latter lies within the "special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, and accordingly is within the United States" when applying a law that regulates only government conduct abroad. Administration lawyers also concluded that the Alien Tort Claims Act, a 1789 statute that allows noncitizens to sue in U.S. courts for violations of international law, couldn't be invoked against the U.S. government unless it consents, and that the 1992 Torture Victims Protection Act allowed suits only against foreign officials for torture or "extrajudicial killing" and "does not apply to the conduct of U.S. agents acting under the color of law." The Bush administration has argued before the Supreme Court that foreigners held at Guantanamo have no constitutional rights and can't challenge their detention in court. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on that question by month's end. For Afghanistan and other foreign locations where the Torture Statute applies, the March 2003 report offers a narrow definition of torture and then lays out defenses that government officials could use should they be charged with committing torture, such as mistakenly relying in good faith on the advice of lawyers or experts that their actions were permissible. "Good faith may be a complete defense" to a torture charge, the report advised. "The infliction of pain or suffering per se, whether it is physical or mental, is insufficient to amount to torture," the report advises. Such suffering must be "severe," the lawyers advise, and they rely on a dictionary definition to suggest it "must be of such a high level of intensity that the pain is difficult for the subject to endure." The law says torture can be caused by administering or threatening to administer "mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the sense of personality." The Bush lawyers advised, though, that it "does not preclude any and all use of drugs" and "disruption of the senses or personality alone is insufficient" to be illegal. For involuntarily administered drugs or other psychological methods, the "acts must penetrate to the core of an individual's ability to perceive the world around him," the lawyers found. Gen. Hill said last week that the military didn't use injections or chemicals on prisoners. After defining torture and other prohibited acts, the memo presents "legal doctrines ... that could render specific conduct, otherwise criminal, not unlawful." Foremost, the lawyers rely on the "commander-in-chief authority," concluding that "without a clear statement otherwise, criminal statutes are not read as infringing on the president's ultimate authority" to wage war. Moreover, "any effort by Congress to regulate the interrogation of unlawful combatants would violate the Constitution's sole vesting of the commander-in-chief authority in the president," the lawyers advised. Likewise, the lawyers found that "constitutional principles" make it impossible to "punish officials for aiding the president in exercising his exclusive constitutional authorities" and neither Congress nor the courts could "require or implement the prosecution of such an individual." To protect subordinates should they be charged with torture, the memo advised that Mr. Bush issue a "presidential directive or other writing" that could serve as evidence, since authority to set aside the laws is "inherent in the president." The report advised that government officials could argue that "necessity" justified the use of torture. "Sometimes the greater good for society will be accomplished by violating the literal language of the criminal law," the lawyers wrote, citing a standard legal text, "Substantive Criminal Law" by Wayne LaFave and Austin W. Scott. "In particular, the necessity defense can justify the intentional killing of one person ... so long as the harm avoided is greater." In addition, the report advised that torture or homicide could be justified as "self-defense," should an official "honestly believe" it was necessary to head off an imminent attack on the U.S. The self-defense doctrine generally has been asserted by individuals fending off assaults, and in 1890, the Supreme Court upheld a U.S. deputy marshal's right to shoot an assailant of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Field as involving both self-defense and defense of the nation. Citing Justice Department opinions, the report concluded that "if a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate criminal prohibition," he could be justified "in doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the al Qaeda terrorist network." Mr. LaFave, a law professor at the University of Illinois, said he was unaware that the Pentagon used his textbook in preparing its legal analysis. He agreed, however, that in some cases necessity could be a defense to torture charges. "Here's a guy who knows with certainty where there's a bomb that will blow New York City to smithereens. Should we torture him? Seems to me that's an easy one," Mr. LaFave said. But he said necessity couldn't be a blanket justification for torturing prisoners because of a general fear that "the nation is in danger." For members of the military, the report suggested that officials could escape torture convictions by arguing that they were following superior orders, since such orders "may be inferred to be lawful" and are "disobeyed at the peril of the subordinate." Examining the "superior orders" defense at the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals, the Vietnam War prosecution of U.S. Army Lt. William Calley for the My Lai massacre and the current U.N. war-crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, the report concluded it could be asserted by "U.S. armed forces personnel engaged in exceptional interrogations except where the conduct goes so far as to be patently unlawful." The report seemed "designed to find the legal loopholes that will permit the use of torture against detainees," said Mary Ellen O'Connell, an international-law professor at the Ohio State University who has seen the report. "CIA operatives will think they are covered because they are not going to face liability."
Lou Cannon's urlLink massive obituary is probably as close as we can get to the last word on Ronald Reagan. It's brilliance lies in Cannon's understanding that Reagan wasn't an ideologue, at least in the way we identify ideologues today. He had deep convictions about communism, and about the greatness of America. Those and other convictions drove him. But there was a kind of pragmatism that also informed his politics - from compromises on tax increases in the mid-1980's to the INF treaty with the Soviet Union. History undergoes constant reassessment. His deficits seemed massive and insurmountable when he left office. We learned two lessons in the last 15 years: we could find our way back to surpluses; and others could create much larger deficits. History probably will never let him off the hook for his insensitivity to the homeless; for what many consider his criminal neglect of the victims of AIDS. Richard Clarke has asked us to see Reagan's lack of a strong response to terror as an encouragement to groups like, al Qaeda, that would come later. He will probably never get all the credit for the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet Union. By 1980, the USSR was a rotting edifice. But there is no doubt that Reagan played a pivotal role the making the 1980's the final decade of Soviet-style communism. Without doubt, he restored American confidence, which had been shattered by Vietnam and a general sense of decline and malaise. President Clinton's idea of America as a force for democracy in the world is a legacy of Reagan's restoration of confidence. But is President George W. Bush's arrogance, over-confidence, and over-willingness to use American power also a legacy of the Reagan Revolution? A mixed record. But would you expect anything less from one of the most important Presidents of the 20th century?
There are few who are more qualified to write about Ronald Reagan than biographer Lou Cannon. Here's his urlLink obituary of the former President from The Washington Post.
1911-2004
Heard an interview last night on urlLink As It Happens with a spokesperson from the Green Party lamenting the party's exclusion once again from the leadership debate. Credible, well-argued. The party is what we would call fringe in American politics and thus far, it's not won a single seat in Parliament. But it does have a regional power base and a thin layer of support spreading across the rest of the country. If I remember correctly (I'm in an airport with sluggish wireless, so pardon my decision not to double-check) the Greens are around 6% in the last poll. They've apparently reached the threshhold to receive government funding. Listening the interview last night, I thought yeah their candidate should be in the debate, too. It's kind of ironic because if it were the US elections we were talking about, I would say don't include them... unless they were fielding a high profile candidate. One of those opinions is probably wrong.
I meant to bring up "The Day After Tomorrow" yesterday. (Does that make sense?) Anyway, I forgot. We saw it Monday. Favorite Audience Moment: A George Bush-type President is told of the unfolding weather catastrophe and, at a loss, turns to a Vice President who looks like Dick Cheney for advice. I've written before about urlLink my perverse love of disaster movies . On a scale of 1-10, this was a 7. It merits a 7 for the scenes in which a four-headed tornado destroys Los Angeles. Too much panoramic view: I like close-up destruction. But the wide shots show the scale of the special effect, so that's what we got. Quite satisfying. I would have given it an 8 except that the giant wave that overtook New York City really didn't destroy the city. The tall buildings remained standing. Yes, freezing causes lots of damage. But it's not the same. I loved the Amero-centric point of view: oh yeah, Europe froze, too , was the general message. How fitting for Fox. Remember... "Armageddon" extended a hand to our European allies, offering up the destruction of Paris. There's a momentary shot of a lurching needle on a seismograph during the tornadic destruction of LA. But they didn't go any further with that thought. An earthquake during a tornado would just be piling on.
The Globe and Mail has the latest installment of its series urlLink "Will Chandler Vote?" ... following 23 year old Chandler Powell from the University of Toronto, as he tries to decide if he'll vote at all in the federal elections; and if so, for whom? He has some smart things to say and he's also kind of hot. (Unfortunately, I don't think his picture is included in the Internet version of the story.) I'd like to talk with him about the election. Personally . Martin's people have changed tactics... standard political playbook stuff... to deal with the fact that probably 70% of Canada is pissed off at him. That has to be worked on first because you can't effectively raise questions about your opponent(s) if you have a serious credibility problem. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty will be sent to urlLink Promise Keepers for pledging not to raise taxes, and then... uh-huh. Nothing else strikes me as all that pressing at the moment. I'll defer to the urlLink BlogWorld's Senior Correspondent on the Canadian Elections for additional news. If you've read his weblog over the last 6 months, you've encountered a growing amount of good political writing about Canada and America, including his evolving views of Martin, Layton, etc.
Run, don't walk, to the nearest theater showing the documentary " urlLink Super Size Me ." We had the first opportunity to see it last night and loved every minute of it. Director and All-McDonalds-All-the-Time Guinea Pig Morgan Spurlock was charming and funny. And unlike Michael Moore, who recently has created documentaries that seem to focus as much on himself as they do on his subject, Spurlock manages to let himself be part of the story without seeming to compete with the issue for center stage. He's quite funny but also clearly presents the case that nutritionists and other healthy eating advocates have been trying to make for years, but perhaps without as much success: fast food is horrible for your body. He makes the case clearly and convincingly, without getting overly preachy. This is one of those rare films where I wished everyone could see it, but that I also enjoyed immensely. See it now.
The Globe and Mail's urlLink website calmly states the tide might be turning toward the Conservatives in Canada's federal elections. But the paper itself features the giant numbers 34-30, the slim lead the Liberals now have over the Conservatives in the new Ipsos-Reid Poll, commissioned by CTV and the Globe and Mail. It's the lowest poll number for the Liberals since Martin became PM in December. On one level, the poll confirms the gut feeling of many during the first full week of campaigning. Paul Martin didn't do poorly, but it was no breakthrough week. The Conservative's Stephen Harper, on the other hand, was the winner after the first round of campaign appearances; Mr. Stiffie stuck to his script with barely a stumble. On another level, though, the polls could also be the result of media coverage, which was generally more harsh on Martin-- the classic front-runner heading for a fall. Harper got off much more lightly by comparison... the NDP's Jack Layton also drawing attention away from Harper with a political incorrect gaffe last week essentially blaming the PM for the deaths of homeless people. Harper's coverage was generally positive. But the news media follows its own script. And once the darling becomes front-runner, journalists begin the process of dissecting and dismantling him. Expect Harper to have to answer more questions about some of the less-palatable statements he's made in his recent past. And expect a more careful examination of his platform, which manages to dramatically increase spending while promising taxes lower than in the US. It probably doesn't add up and the next week or two will be a close examination of Stephen Harper and what he plans to do for Canada. The story of the day is the potential for a Conservative minority government with the Bloc Quebecois as the junior partner. Fascinating, but likely? Certainly an odd couple, but the fact is that this latest poll shows that the Liberals couldn't put together a majority with the NDP because the NDP is basically nowhere to be found. Jack Layton got a lot of media attention last week, much of it the kind he probably didn't want. In the most recent elections, the NDP has failed the climb out of the single digits, so at this point, perhaps anything is an improvement. I'm beginning to ramble, so let's get out. A couple of things to watch: young people apparently have been leaning toward Harper, or so I heard a couple of times last week. I haven't seen a good breakout of demographics so I'll keep my eyes open for that. I've been paying a lot of attention to the Liberal collapse in Ontario. Ontarians are angry about the broken tax promise of the provincial Liberals. It'll be interesting to see how deep and lasting that anger is. Oh, and so much for the high-mindedness. A week ago, the CBC nearly broke its arm patting itself on the back for how wonderful its election coverage was going to be. "We won't focus on the horse race," we were told. The CBC was to present a searing, important conversation among Canadians about the future direction of the country. Which lasted for about a day. The CBC has done a better job of staying on message, but it's hard to resist the joy of dualing messages from party war rooms flashing across Blackberry devices from coast to coast. And look what I'm doing. A big chunk of what I've written has been about media coverage of the campaign and not the issues themselves. So there ya go.
I'm on vacation this week and next and so I expect that there will be few posts while I take some time to relax and smell the roses. Have a good time, enjoy the convention, or avoid it as the case might be, and I'll talk to you again in a few days!
I'm going to drop this urlLink airline terror story after this post because the story is bullshit. I was about to write that it's not worth the time of day... but I'll amend that because I think there need to be people who come forward and call this account what it is: bullshit. Few of you are probably regular readers of the Washington Times, but if you want to see how this story is overplayed for the fear angle (yes, Michael Moore, you're right) then urlLink check out this piece . And try not to vomit as you read vile anti-Arab statements like this: "It's a probe. They are probing us," said a second air marshal, who confirmed that Middle Eastern men try to flush out marshals by rushing the cockpit and stopping suddenly. One of the most respected airline industry analysts wrote me this last night: The story is such bullshit and even though these musicians have now been PROVEN innocent, this woman continues to get credence (and airtime, including CNN last night...) by claiming that no matter what anyone says she saw a terrorist plot being hatched.
Mark Kelly interviewed Carmen bin laden on urlLink "The Current" this morning... an enlightening conversation and I expect CBC will have audio of it online later today or tomorrow. If you're reading this while it's still fresh, you can link over to the urlLink CBC's streams and catch it after the 11am ET News on CBC Edmonton or Calgary... or after 12 pm ET on CBC Vancouver. In the meantime... here are urlLink interview excerpts from ABC Primetime back in '01.
If you have some free time and want to read a piece of stupid shit... check out urlLink this piece . A group of Arab-American musicians flying with their instruments causes "terror" among a group of stupid Americans... and the chief of them is the author of this piece.
After 24 hours, Lucky is an old pro at handling the spiral staircase in my loft. He tears up and down the stairs, using them as a refuge whenever he hears a loud noise outside that he deems dangerous. Since I live in a city, that must be about every 5 minutes. Up the stairs he goes and hovers... peering over the edge waiting for some kind of cat sense of "all clear." Like any pet his age, he can be annoying as hell, wanting to play and bite and the time. The tiny scratches on my arms tell the story of our antics. And then there's the particular kitty tendency of perching and pouncing. If I tell my friends he's annoying as hell, it's because I love the little booger. The musical experiments continue and expand. He seems to enjoy classical music greatly. It's calming, even over the cacophony of the street below, and he seems to sleep easier with it on. I've been doing my own audience testing with him today and as far as I can tell, he prefers urlLink Classical 96.3 to urlLink Radio Two . 96.3 is more predictable... Radio Two has the occasional jarring piece and the clapping during a concert today sent him up the spiral staircase at high speed. Next... what Lucky thinks of American Idol and Nip Tuck.
I'm kitty-watching this week... a 3-month old boy who belongs to a friend of my boyfriend's. He's a joy... a complete scalliwag with far more chutzpah than you would expect from a kitten as small as he is. He's a riot to play with... all teeth and claws, now sitting on my legs peering over the top of my notebook, curious about all the tapping sounds from the keyboard, batting a paw at my fingers. Lucky is his name... and lucky is what I am since I'm getting to hear a concert featuring urlLink Measha Brueggergosman this afternoon on urlLink CBC Radio Two . I've seen her perform in person twice and she's not only a rising star, but she's ravishing. I put Radio Two on the stereo to keep Lucky company while I was out and I got a cool surprise concert from Measha when I walked in the door. Lucky was fine with Measha, the spirituals and the Copland... but the contemporary brass music has him cowering in the corner!
Changing a Light Bulb the Christian Way How many Christians does it take to change a light bulb? Charismatic: Only 1 Hands are already in the air. Pentecostal : 10 One to change the bulb, and nine to pray against the spirit of darkness. Presbyterians: None Lights will go on and off at predestined times. Roman Catholic: None. Candles only. Baptists: At least 15. One to change the light bulb, and three committees to approve the change and decide who brings the potato salad and fried chicken. Episcopalians : 3 One to call the electrician, one to mix the drinks and one to talk about how much better the old one was. Mormons : 5 One man to change the bulb, and four wives to tell him how to do it. Unitarians: We choose not to make a statement either in favor of or against the need for a light bulb. However, if in your own journey you have found that light bulbs work for you, you are invited to write a poem or compose a modern dance about your light bulb for the next Sunday service, in which we will explore a number of light bulb traditions, including incandescent, fluorescent, 3-way, long-life, and tinted, all of which are equally valid paths to luminescence. Methodists: Undetermined Whether your light is bright, dull, or completely out, you are loved. You can be a light bulb, turnip bulb, or tulip bulb. Bring a bulb of your choice to the Sunday lighting service and a covered dish to pass around. Nazarene : 6 One woman to replace the bulb while five men review church lighting policy. Lutherans: None Lutherans don't believe in change. Amish: What's a light bulb?
To tell the truth, I'm kind of looking forward to having urlLink al Jazeera on my TV . Not that I think it's going to happen anytime soon, thanks to the CRTC's ruling this week requiring cable or satellite providers to prevent potentially abusive content from being broadcast. Just how a cable company is going to constantly monitor a live 24 hour news network, in Arabic, and turn off objectionable content on the fly... wasn't adequately explained. Which means I won't be seeing the subversive al Jazeera on Star Choice anytime soon. Enough of that. As Mark Kelley said on "The Current" this morning... it has to be summer if we're actually talking about the Canada's media regulatory body. The weekend will be quiet. We went out on the lake last weekend, enjoying a Sunday afternoon with our favorite lesbians and acquiring sunburns; mine not as bad as my boyfriend's. We're going to see the newly-restored version of the original "Godzilla" film this weekend, and probably urlLink "The Corporation" as well.
Work will not slow down, but if there's anything I've learned, sometimes it's not a bad idea to put your foot on the brake and pull off to the side of the road for a few minutes to survey the scene. So that's what I'm going to do now. The weblog will go on brief hiatus, as is traditional, sometime later this month. Last year, I took about 3 weeks away from writing, which seemed about right. I don't think I'll be gone that long this year, in part because I feel bad for ignoring the weblog so much already. But I expect the Internet to be free of the ToddBlog virus for 1-2 weeks. Summer is moving too quickly... too quickly for me to fully enjoy the fact that it's summer and to recognize that this is, in fact, the time when I usually get the most from the season. The weather has only recently begun to cooperate, and that's doubtless a factor. There's also work, which has been relentless. And how can we underestimate the effect of the death of the Frugal Gourmet? I liked the guy... and for years, I thought he was one of the better TV chefs. Once I was old enough to hear the stories of his interest in young men, at least some of whom apparently weren't interested in him, I tended to ignore the stories because they didn't fit with the kind of man I wanted him to be. I wanted a genial, rather goofy, guy with curly white hair to preach to me about food. But I also wanted him to be a good family man. Well, life is complicated and I've since learned that while people aren't as good as they should be, most people are as good as they can be. Was Jeff Smith one of those people? I don't know. His tantrums and occasionally boorish behavior are legendary, even by TV star standards. (At least, PBS Star standards.) It would be easy to conclude that he screwed up the one good thing he had going for him - that mini PBS empire he had built, the fans, the book sales. But perhaps it's not that simple. We all have a self-destructive streak, I think. And we will tend to find a way to do the things that we want to do, even if they are illegal, or offensive, or hurtful, or frowned on by others. The Frug probably lived his life pretty close to the way he wanted to live it. And then he bore the consequences.
Jeff Smith, the longtime "Frugal Gourmet" on PBS, has urlLink died at the age of 65 . Smith - at one time one of America's most popular TV chefs - was plagued by lawsuits alleging sexual abuse of young men who worked for him. The scandals brought his TV career to an end.
Sorry for being so quiet. Big time of month, fiscal year, etc., and all that crap. Everything is good with me and hope the same is the case with you! Give me a day or two to nail things down and then I'll have more to say.
I'm interrupting my little 2 week vacation from blogging to say a thing or two about urlLink Soblo . He was one of the best of the personal experience bloggers, in my opinion, and although I don't think we've seen the last of him, I'm sorry to see him go. Personal experience bloggers walk a fine line between chronicling daily existence in all its mundane and profound moments... and indulging in narcissism. All of us have fallen into the trap at one time or another. But Soblo was as good as anyone in creating a story around his life and times that was interesting and had a natural arc. He didn't spout off just to hear himself vent. He didn't grandstand. He wasn't obnoxious about his opinions. He revealed some of his fears and misgivings. He told us when he cried. In the end, he laid bare his mistake and how he paid the price for it. He was - and is - a good guy. So that's why I feel bad for him and the events that have led him to close his weblog. This Internet thing is dangerous to any of us who think we can enjoy a certain anonymity. Some don't write about their personal life at all. Many of us who do, create shields around ourselves, often by fictionalizing chunks of the blog version of our life. But I think all of us manage to weave a large core of truth into what we write, even if the truth is difficult for outsiders to discern. And maybe our error is in being seduced into thinking our real world won't collide with the world we've created for the entertainment and edification of others - and, of ourselves. The guy who comes to life from my weblog is a slightly better version of me. Here, I'm a little smarter, a little nicer, and a little more articulate (perhaps barely) than the real me that gets up and goes to work and the gym every day. Perhaps the guy we read about over at Soblo was a little more cocky than the smart, quiet, shy guy who wrote about him. But he was pretty cool, wasn't he?
I actually had fun at the wedding. My dad introduced me to all the people he works with and I heard a lot of stories about my dad and what my dad tells them about me. lol It was rather interesting. Then jokingly I asked my dad to get me a glass of wine, well I didn't think he would, but to my surprise when he came back he had the big glass of wine...Well, as the reception went on these waiter guys kept coming around to fill up the glass...I really didn't notice them doing it, they just sorta did it when I wasn't looking. Well after 3 big glasses of wine and 2 glasses of champain...I got a little tipsy...My dad and his work buddies were laughing at me because I was stumbling around and had trouble keeping my head up...and yeah...Now the whole point of me being there was to talk to a recruiter from Westpoint. Well...when I talked to him it didn't work out to well. I couldn't concentrate on what he was saying...Instead of concentrating on what he was saying...I was concentrating on standing...lol it was great...I'm sure I made such a good impression on him lol...Well, when I got home I had no trouble sleeping...I KNOCKED OUT!!! We got home at 5 and I woke up at 11 only because my damn cell phone was ringing off the wall...O well, still had a good nap, I know if my cell didn't ring I could have slept until tomorrow morning...o well...tomorrow should be fun, we got a swim party for church and Juan might go. O well, I'm gonna go...Catch yall later!
Well, Recently I haven't been getting a lot of sleep. For the last week they have been working on our ditch outside and they have some machine out there that runs all night long. Due to the fact that its loud it prevents me from sleeping. In fact last night after my last post I laid in bed and tossed and turned until 9am when I finally got out of bed. THIS THING IS DRIVING MY CRAZY! Now I cant go to sleep at all because we have a wedding to go to in about and hour. O well, hopefully we will leave right after the thing and not go to the reception. I really need some sleep. I hate not being able to sleep. On to a new subject...For the past few weeks my internet in my room hasn't been working and we have tried and tried to figure out what was wrong with the damn thing! We bought a new Ethernet Card for it and took it to a computer place and nothing would seem to work...Well at 9 a computer guy from SBC came over (that's why I had to get up) and he told us that it was the damn portal. We would have never figured that shit out. We would still probably be looking for the damn thing if he hadn't come out. O well, the fact is the computer in my room is working now...and that makes me a happy person. :) Well, I got to go start to get ready for the stupid Wedding, catch yall later!
Well, after debating about it for several days I finally decided to get me one of these things. Although it isn't live journal like the rest of my friends I still got one! This is where my thoughts will go about what happened during the course of my day. I have a feeling I may piss some people off as the weeks go by but o well, I don't care. Well today, or sense its rather late it would be yesterday, I didn't end up going to sleep until around 8 or 9 in the mourning. I just couldn't sleep. I tried going to sleep around 1 and for some reason I just kept tossing and turning. Well after I finally got to sleep the phone rang and woke me up...and once again...I couldn't go back to sleep...So I got my ass out of bed and cooked me some food. Around 6 my parents and I picked up Juan and we all went to Specs liquor...Very cool store, went to best buy and then to Wings and More. At WAM we watched the Astro's game. That's another thing...WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE ASTROS?!?! We need better pitching. I have been an Astros fan all my life and I will always be an Astros fan...but geeze guys...Get out of your slump and start winning some games! O -well. When I got home from taking Juan home I saw this thing about that new Movie Fahrenheit 9/11. Now that shit really pisses me off. All these damn liberal media people never give Bush any credit. All I ever hear when I turn on the news is Bush bashing! That damn movie makes the creator of the film look stupid because all the stuff he uses in there is all spliced together to make him look bad! IT MAKES NO SENSE! I hate the fucking Demanazies...O-well...Back to sports...t.u is in the college World Series...I hate the fact that they made it that far. Many people think I should go for them just because they are from Texas...but no...I hope the lose, even though they will probably win. I will give them some credit and say they do have a good team. O well, A did pretty good this year with their baseball team, but they ended up losing to LSU in the Super Regionals...o well, good year for them. Well, now that I have bored all of yall with my rambling, I think I will go now. Talk to yall later!
I forgot to mention..... t.u. LOST!!!!!!
Today after church we had a swim party at one of them members house. That was a lot of fun. I haven't been swimming in a while...Hell I haven't been outside with my shirt off in a long time so I was WHITE! I got burn like you wouldn't believe. I have a hard time sitting, laying, and it burns like a bitch when I take a shower. O well, but the day was productive. I got to know someone a little better today. I've known the person a while but I got to know her a lot better. Makes me think...and its scary when I start to think lol...Anyways...today my lil friend from church got me a late birthday present. This boy is a lil longhorn boy and when he gave me the present I was surprised because it was in an A bag, had an A card, and all A stuff...it was pretty cool. Might end up getting him recruited to A by the time he gets outta elementary...hah...anyways...I'm bored...I hurt...and I'm hungry...Ill catch yawl later!
Well today started of with a bang! I had to take my dog Desie to the vet...well that didn't work out to well! Now...if you know Desie you will know he is scared of everything! Well, when I was walking up to him with the leash...he ran...so I had to chase him down. After I finally got the leash on the damn dog I had to put him in the car (so I thought) when opening the door to get him in the car he got real freaked out and started to run...well I had the leash on him so he couldn't get to far. I grab his collar to pull him to the car...then the damn dog bites me gets his head out of the collar and runs under the house! Needless to say he missed his appointment. Then just a few min. Ago my dear sweet Dolores called me...boy that went real well...Past few days she has been giving me an attitude...saying I haven't been "the same"...bullshit...She's the damn one giving me the damn attitude...I'm trying to have a nice convo with her but no...she wants to be sarcastic and ignore me...bleh...I hate this shit...I can see that this week is going to go to hell...Its already gotten off to a bad start. O well, maybe it will get better...I can only hope...I'm out...talk to yall later
Well, Thankfully Tuesday and Wednesday went great! Tuesday I didn't get a lot of sleep and I was awake for 24 hours but it was good. Tuesday night I went to wings and More and came home to find out that they moved that damn blue thing that was out in front of my house! That made me they happiest person on this Planet! So needless to say Tuesday/Wednesday I got the best sleep ever. Wednesday afternoon I woke up around 3:45, told you I slept good, and freaked out because I saw the time. I went to bed at 1am and slept that long, that has never happened to me before. Usually if I go to bed at 1 I wake up around 10am or so but this time I slept great! So after that I just watched a little TV and picked my mom up from the bus stop then Juan and I went looking for this CD that I've been wanting, Big Rich, because I like their song "Save a Horse Ride a Cowboy". That was an adventure! We first go to Best Buy...I can't find the CD anywhere so I asked one of the sales people, well...They SAID they had 15 in stock but they were nowhere to be found. The lady looked in the back and everything, but I dunno if she really looked...She didn't look to bright. So after that we walked over to Barns and Noble to look in their CD section...Well the lady behind the counter seemed high on something and she told me they didn't have it after looking it up. Juan is telling me to forget it and order it online but I was determined to get that CD. So finally we drove to Target...and you would figure it would be the FIRST CD I see when I walk up. So I bought the CD and then went to Starbucks. It was a fun adventure lol and well worth it. I think Juan even thinks it was worth it too because he likes one of those songs on the CD because one of the Country people raps in it lol. Its a pretty cool song...and a really cool CD. :) Ok people, now I am going to bitch about politics so if you don't want to read on you don't have to...but for those people who always argue with me, I encourage you to read on. Now, when we got into this war all the Demazazies bitched about it and wanted nothing to do with it. They wanted us to pull out and hand it back over to the Iraqis! Well...Now that president Bush does that...THEY BITCH ABOUT THAT!!! WHAT THE HOLY HELL!??! President Bush handed the country over the Iraqi government early so it would eliminate the possibility of a Terrorist attack. That just makes them bitch! They are saying "We shouldn't of handed it over early because it didn't give a chance for people to celebrate" What the hell? He was doing them all a favor! Yall finally got what yall wanted, hell you even got it two days earlier than what President Bush said, now yall bitch about it. I wish they would Just sit down and shut the hell up! I saw a bumper Sticker that said it best... "The road to HELL is paved with Liberals" ...Thank You!
Well its been a while sense I last posted and figured it was time to post again. A lot has happened sense the last time I posted and a lot of it I don't really want to talk about. Nothing really happened on Thursday and on Friday Juan and I saw Spiderman 2. It was a pretty good movie I guess...I liked it better than the first one. Saturday I did a whole lot of nothing. I went to this BBQ in Crosby thrown by some guy at my church, it sucked ass. My and two of my friends were listening to the radio in my car and it turns out when its time to leave we kinda drained the battery...lol that was funny. Sunday went to church and then my uncle came over and we all watched the fireworks between Jacinto City and Galena Park then later on went to Starbucks in the Galaria...not a whole lot going on to post about. Have no complaints about the way things are going right now. Things can be better or worse. Oh, one last thing...If you want to read my blog and get mad at me because you don't like what I have to say about politics...Well, you can stop getting mad at me and sending me vulgar e-mails cussing me out because you don't like what I have to say. My e-mail address is not where you cuss me out. I told yall at the start I don't care if you get pissed off or not. This my place where I can put what I want without fear of what people read...If you don't like what I say and want to complain about it...Get your own damn blog...Don't e-mail me and CC all your friends...That's just gay...Make your blog...Type what you have to say...Post a comment telling me to go there...Then we can have Blog wars...That would be fun. And I think I just pissed off the person even more...lol I DON'T CARE!! :) Anyways, I'm out...Later!

Things are going good and I'm starting to enjoy summer...Well, that's it for now. Talk later!
Ok, I recently read joys journal and all the responces so I have to get my word in. Everybody knows my views on gays, cant stand them, never will. And I seriously hate the fact that the Governmanet want to leagalize it... In a responce to joys journal a person wrote "Ever hear of seperation of church and state?" Well, in my opinion seperationg of church and state is a bunch on nonsence. This country was founded on the principals of christian believes and i hate when i hear people bitching about saying the word "God" in the plege or in school or anything to do wiht our government. Wehn a president gets sworn into offince he hold his hand on the Bible and says an oath, same thing in court. Is that now wrong too? I hate this Bull about seperation of church and state. Now back to the gay subject. The bible falt out says Homosexuality is a sin, "Do not practice homosexuality; it is a detestable sin" Leviticus 18:22. You can also find it in Romans 1:18-32 and in 1 Corithians 6:9-10. Now wether you want to say that the bible has its faults and blah blah blah, thats your decision. But it says right htere that it is a sin, and thats what Ill believe. "We take his name out of schools Lawyers say it breaks the rules Pledge of Alligence cant me read And 'Under God' should not be said I wounder how much he will take, I just pray its not to late What if God quit trying? He just turned away If there were tear drops on his face Tell me how would you feel, youd prally give up too If nobody believed in you" ~Joe Nicholes
" 'This country was founded on the principals of christian believes' Bullshit, this Country was based on freedom of religion. Therefor, all your bitching about how christianity is the only religion that isn't going to burn in hell is very rediculous, because you've got to realize that Christianity is a new idea compared to buddism and hinduism... fuck it, atheism is older then christianity. I can't wait for one of these days to come when you really care for someone, and you try to further your bond with them in whatever way, and you cant because of bigotry and hatred. Do you think you have a bigger cock because you stand in the way of people's happiness? Do you get some sick amusement to make people feel bad? It's bigots like you who give the United States a bad name. Congratufuckinglations on becoming a jackass." Ok, First of all, whoever posted that comment needs to go back and read what i wrote! Not once did i say that christianity was the only religion not going to hell....In fact, i didnt even mention anybody going to hell...I just stated what i believed as far as the bible and christianity. And as far as this country being founded on christian beliefes...HELLO GENIOUS!!! IT WAS!! Read in every history book...it says it right there. On money it says "In god we trust"...in teh plege..."One Nation Under God"...It mentions god in our constitution! Like I said, I wasnt denouncing other religions or beliefes. Thats what makes this country great, you can worship whatever you like. I have friends who are athiest and the list goes on and on. I have no problem with a person being gay! thats their right, Im just saying what I believe is right, that my faith tells me is right! So if that makes me a jackass I guess i am...I dont know how you got what you did from my last post...but its however you want to translate it. O btw, i have 2 gay friends and a gay aunt that i love to death...but it still doesnt cahnge what i believe. God Bless America
Ok, so I havent posted in a while, sue me, just havent had much to say nor felt like logging on to type! So now here is an update about what has been going on....um....lets see...I went to some program at A and got trained like i was in the corps. that was awsome, made me realise how close i really am to going...I got my foot in teh door, just gotta get my application in.

Today I was thinking about a lot of the hypocritical bullshit that takes place in this world on a daily basis. I came to this conclusion after much thought. What I realized is that everyone in this world is in it for competition. They are just doing shit so they can compete to get some shit that will never fully satisfy them. Jocks compete in football to go to the championship and get a damn trophy, but they aren't satisfied even if they make it all the way to their godforsaken championship. Because they will always look back and say, ‘Oh no, I only had a record of 10-6.’ Well buddy you made it all the way to the fucking championship, but that obviously isn't good enough for yourself. I guess its just human nature. It doesn't matter how good you have it you always want better. Even the richest man in the world, Bill Gates, isn't satisfied. If he was, don't you think his $46 billion dollar ass would fucking retire and buy a small Caribbean Island? Well apparently not. He keeps making his shitty windows operating system and flooding the market with sub par 1st party X-Box games so that his $46 billion dollars turns into $47 billion. He has more money than most countries and he is still not happy. Even the big movie stars can’t be happy. Like Ben Affleck, he was engaged to the gorgeous Jennifer Lopez and he decided she is not hot enough and cheats on her. What the fuck is up with that? Not to mention he has enough money to live for the rest of his life at 31 without having to make another shitty movie ever. Hopefully he will retire and we won’t have to ever see another Reindeer Games or Bounce. The only redeeming part of Reindeer Games was Charlize Theron’s rack. All life is, is one big fucking competition to see who can get the more money, the faster car, the hotter girl, the bigger house, well I say fuck everyone and their competitions. I am sick of seeing guys with girls I can only dream about pissing it all away because they can make out with some random girl or fuck some other girl or finally fulfill their fantasy of a threesome. Anything anyone will ever accomplish will not be good enough for themself. I am sick of all these people bitching and moaning with I wish this and I wish that. Well its bullshit. You may think the grass is greener on the other side, but I don’t care what you think. You probably have some hot girl that isn’t good enough for you. Or your set for life as far as money goes and it doesn’t matter what you do. I really think you should take your green grass and shove it up your ass because I am sick of everyone’s bullshit.
Today began with the potential for a bad day. I was awoken at 9:30, and my father informed me that today was the lucky day that we would visit the transfer station/dump. That was a smelly and messy job, and it was thankfully finished by 11:00. After that, I showered and lounged around for an hour, until Trevor got here and we went to lift. Nothing exciting happened there, and I was back home at about 1:30. I once again sat around for a while, and at about 2:00, I left the house with the idea of running errands. My first stop was the bank, and I saw Sara. I went over and talked to her for several minutes, and we ended up going back to her house for a while. While we were there, we looked at women's clothing in an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog. Since we didn't go for a walk on Sunday, we decided to make up for it today. We walked from her house to the Kinney's warehouse, where she picked up an application for work, and then we headed for the East Side Playground. We played on the swings for several minutes (an activity that I have missed doing, by the way), and then we sat down by the monkey bars and talked some more. After that, our walk recommenced down Gleason Street. We were heading towards my house, and I told her that she shouldn't have to walk home alone, and we hung a quick left and started back toward her house. She showed me a condemned building where she used to think I lived, and when we got to her house, we sat on her back porch and talked for several minutes. I would have been quite content to just sit there all day and talk, but I had a soccer game to go to. So at about 4:30, she gave me a ride home. So ended my first walk with Sara. It was quite an enjoyable experience. When I returned home, I quickly located a ride. Lammy brought me to Travis' house, where we waited for Justin, then we headed towards IR for our game. We lost 1-0. Within the first 5 minutes, I had already been jump-kicked in the leg. That was quite painful, but I played on. I did enjoy talking trash with some of the kids on that team, because they were so horrible at it. One rather overweight kid called me fat, and another one called me gay. Those two insults cut me deeply. Somehow, I have no idea how, one of those kids ended up on the ground. I played fairly well, I think. My leg does hurt, but after such a good day, I couldn't care less.
Well, today began like any other so far this vacation, with me getting roughly six hours of sleep. My inability to sleep for long periods of time is puzzling, yet it does not seem to adversely affect me in any way. Anyway, after I woke up, I sat around and did absolutely nothing for several hours. Big Head and I were supposed to lift at 10, but he didn't show. Around noon, I thought going for a walk would make me feel better. However, as I was walking, who should I come across but Trevor himself. He stopped and picked me up, and we drove to my house, so I could change my clothing, and then off to lift. I set a personal best in the bench press, one which I won't divulge here, to avoid embarrassment. After that, I went home and was asked to work in place of my sister this evening. This is something that my dear friend Sara would call an opportunity cost. I was giving up something, my Tuesday evening off, in order to gain something of equal or greater value, Saturday. I wanted Saturday off so that I would be able to attend a graduation party I was invited to. I was also invited to Madeline's graduation party on Sunday, and hopefully I am able to attend that one as well. Today is Tuesday, June 29. In one week Driver's Education begins. I received some news about that today as well. According to Renee Besaw, Nikki Weaver is no longer in my car. My car now consists of myself, Tiffany Cummings, Renee Besaw, Mr. Knowlton, and an undisclosed person. I hope they aren't short. The Tuesday after next, the 13th, is my birthday. It is not a milestone that I am looking forward to, as my birthdays are usually depressing and lonesome. Perhaps it will be different this year, but that's doubtful. The Tuesday after that, the 20th, is the day that the St. Lawrence County Fair begins, an event that will bring rednecks from all over this county to our town. This is quite an eventful month. Well, I guess I'll leave it at that.
This is my first entry on this blog thingy. I figure I'll just update it as often as I feel like it, which should be just about every day. I guess I'll just talk about my day and the such. Here goes. Today I did something really stupid. Well, I guess it all began yesterday night, when I found out Sara couldn't walk with me. She was previously occupied. I became upset, for whatever reason. My away message when I went to bed was a rather scathing one. Shortly after I awoke, I conversed with her and managed to yell at probably the nicest girl in the whole world. That was a good way to start the day. However, my day did get a little better. While I was walking around during the day, around 1:30 maybe, I managed to have a rather interesting discussion with Sara's mother and little sister about skirts. After that, I walked over to the Trackside to lift, I thought by myself. However, Trevor had also just gotten there, and we ended up lifting together. After that "drove-through" McDonald's for lunch, with me on the paying end. Then came the part of the day I look forward to least, work. It was deathly slow, and extremely boring. Eventually, however, it ended and I was able to come home. Now here I am, sitting at my computer creating my first blog entry. I'll end it here.
Well...it's been a very long time since I updated this thing. I do have an excuse for that. Several excuses, actually. First off, and mainly, I was grounded from the Internet for a week and a half. Let me take you back in time, roughly a week and a half ago, Friday the 9th. That is where it all began. Let's see, my mother was not working that Friday, and that was half the trouble. I went to pick up my check at my work, left my house at about 10:00 AM. I received my check at about 10:30, and I went to the bank to deposit my check. I realized that it was the Friday that I was supposed to deliver gummy worms and bears to Savanna. I went to Kinney's, bought some gummies, and went to her house to give them to her. It was approximately 11:00 when I got there. I only intended to stay a few minutes, but I was mistaken. I was there for almost 4 hours, in which time I watched the end of a movie with Sara,tried to guess what present Savanna got me, cooked their dinner for a while, and crawled under their back porch to retrieve their mother's bracelet. It was fun, oddly. When I got home at 3:00, my mother informed me that I was grounded indefinitely for not informing her of where I was. I thought that was rather harsh, but I did not say anything. I went to work that night, and when I got home at 9, my father made me produce my Internet adapter. That weekend was rather boring, as it was all work and no play. On Monday, I had driver's ed in the morning, and after that I worked from 12-9. My co-workers thought they would announce over the loudspeaker that my birthday was the next day. I was still grounded when I came home Monday evening, and also on Tuesday morning, my birthday. I had the best birthday of my entire life, I believe, in spite of the fact that I was grounded. I remember it vividly. In the morning, I went to drivers ed class from 7:30-8:30, and largely attracted little attention, which is good. I don't like lots of attention. I went home after that and sat around, kind of bored. At 10:00, I went over to the school and sat on Mark Lamson's car as I waited to drive. Renee Besaw brought me ice cream, which I enjoyed. Then Savanna brought me my presents. A pair of Aeropostale shorts, and a lollipop (a reference to our Theatre Arts play) were her gifts to me, and I liked them very much. I was very touched that she got me something. I would have loved it no matter what. Anyway, after that, I went driving and almost hit a house backing up. I might need a little practice. After that little adventure, I went home and sat around for the afternoon. At about 5:00, Maddie asked me ifI wanted to go mini-golfing with her. I asked my father, and he agreed, much to my surprise. At 6:00, she came and got me, got me a card, and we went mini-golfing. That was extremely enjoyable, and I had fun. When we finished our 18 holes, we went for a ride in go-karts. Nobody told us beforehand that we weren't supposed to use both tracks. According to the man that was there, that was the first time anyone had ever done that. Really though, they should put up signs or something. We went to Pizza Hut for dinner, and then we went home. She is a lot of fun to hang out with. When I got home, I found a new watch waiting for me. Also, I got my Internet returned to me. I went to bed happy that night. Apparently though, I did not shut down my computer, and I got my Internet revoked again. Anyway, Wednesdays are my favorite days, and losing my Internet did not dampen my spirits much. Drivers ed was boring as usual, and I went home and sat around for a while. Later on, I got my watch adjusted so it would fit my skinny wrist. At about noon, a package arrived with my copy of NBA Live 2004 enclosed. I played that for a while, and at about 3:00, Sara called me, and then she came and picked me up, and we went back to her house. She gave me a choice; we could either go for our walk as is normal, or she could cut my hair for a birthday present. I chose the latter. When we entered her house, I found that she had indeed baked me a cake, and it was a great cake. Sara, Savanna, Nicky, and several of Nicky's friends sang Happy Birthday to me, and I blew out all the candles on my cake. It only took me 4 tries. After that, we ate cake and talked for a while. Then, as it got later, Sara began cutting my hair. Soccer on Wednesday usually meant that I would be picked up by Trevor at 5, but he was unable to go. Therefore, I had to act quickly. While Sara was cutting my hair, I called Mark and had him stop by Sara's so that I could get a ride to Indian River. Sara's mother put the finishing touches on my hair, and I thanked everyone before I left. Mark and I stopped by my house quickly, and then we scrunched in the back seat with Mallory, as Travis sat shotgun and Justin drove. Anyway, we lost again, and although I made some errors, I played decently overall. I did aggravate a pre-existing leg injury. That was Wednesday, fun day. However, the next 4 days were not very remarkable, other than Gouverneur winning Battle of the Bands in Ogdensburg, and event I watched with Maddie and Kyle. That brings us to today, Monday. Once again, I awoke at 7:00 to go to drivers ed class. After that, I sat around and then lifted with Trevor until about 1. We got caught between construction and a stopped train, and we couldn't find a way that didn't involve either, so we eventually took the construction route. We stopped by McDonald's, got some grub, and he dropped me off. After I ate, I got bored, so I went for a walk to think. I walked for about an hour, then I stopped by P to visit Sara as she was working. I went home after that, walked to the bank and P to pick up paper towels, then went home and ate tacos for dinner. Mmmmm, tacos. That was about it, and I think that's plenty for now.
Today is Wednesday. Wednesday is my favorite day of the week this summer, I've discovered. Today I awoke at 7:00, showered, and went to driver's education for an hour. I returned home at 8:30, went lifting with Trevor at 9:00, and returned at about 10:00. At about 12:30, I walked to Sara's and we went for our walk as has become our custom on Wednesdays. On my way there I saw my good friend Roxi. First we walked to Key Bank to set up her account (a common theme, as you'll come to see). But the woman that we were looking for was at lunch, so we went back to her house quickly and then we walked to P C to see a man about a job for Sara. On the way there and back, I was "stung by a bee" 5 times and pushed into incoming traffic 3 times. After that, we went to the bank again to try and set up her account. When we got there, the woman we needed to speak with was on the phone, so we talked quietly for a few minutes. After a few minutes, we found out that Sara needed her driver's license, which she did not bring with her. We went back to her house once again, she got her license, and we went back the the bank again. Once again, the woman was on the phone and we talked for a few more minutes. Finally, we got her account set up and we walked back to her house, and it started to rain. She gave me a ride home, and it began to storm. Eventually, it stopped and Trevor showed at about 5:15, and we went to our game. Trevor and James played on LaFargeville's team, and my team won 7-4. I played very well, I thought, but I wasn't sure. Trevor gave me a ride home and that's all I did today. I love Wednesdays.
Today started early, because I had drivers ed at 7:30 this morning. I got up, showered, and went over to the school. After waiting for a few minutes, I went up to my class on the 3rd floor. And then I took a seat in the back of the class and my driver's education experience began. It was a bit of an orientation day, so it was slightly boring. After that I went home and slept for about an hour, then went back over to the school to drive. While I was waiting, I talked with Savanna for the first time in days, Travis, Lammy, and Kim (Mark's sister). That was fun. When we got to our car, Mr. Knowlton showed us the basics and then Matt Todd got behind the wheel. Let's just say he has room for improvement. Tiffany Cummings was next, and she did alright, except for she made me hit my head multiple times against the top of the car. Then Renee Besaw drove, and she has her license, so she was pretty good. Then it was my turn, to drive from the West Side School back to the High School. Apart from gunning it once, I did pretty well. After that, I went home. I ate lunch and sat around until 1, when I went lifting with Trevor and Kyle Rizzo. I got home at about 2:30, and found that my Interent access had been removed, because I didn't do the laundry, even though I did. I slept for a few hours, because I was tired. After that I mowed some of the lawn, ate Chinese food for dinner, and cleaned my room, so I could get my Internet back, which I did. After that, I sat here and watched TV and talked to people. That was my day.
Whoa. I haven't updated this thing all weekend. That's probably because I've been having so much fun, which is strange for me. Well, let me think back. Saturday I woke up rather late, at about 8:45. I know, it's not that late, but it is for me. My leg felt much better, almost back to 100%. I walked up to lift, and I did legs for the first time in 2 weeks. I did everything pretty much without pain, except squats. My leg wasn't having it. Anyway, after that I walked home. When I got home, I took a shower and lounged around for an hour or two. Then Lammy came and got me, we stopped a few places, and then we went to Josh McAdam's graduation party. It was pretty fun, if a little warm. Mark and I played horseshoes against Clayton McAdam and a kid named Ricky. We lost, 21-13, but it was still fun. After that, there was alot of sitting around and talking, which was enjoyable. Brian and Ben Peters, Nate Gifford, Glenn Dygert, Marc Smithers, Maggie Simmons, and Sara were all participants in the conversations. After a while, though, I became bored. As Marc and Sara were leaving, I asked for a ride home and they agreed. After I got home, I got hungry and I walked to McDonald's and got something to eat, and as I was walking home, Trevor picked me up and dropped me off at home. After I ate, I watched a really funny movie, Tommy Boy. I love that movie. After that, I set up camp on my front lawn to prepare for fireworks. My dad let one of our coworker's family park in our driveway. When they got there, I was sitting out front. My dad came out and we talked with them for a few moments. I was introduced to our coworker's family, her daughter and son, and her husband, and a friend of her daughter. They invited me to watch the fireworks with them, but I declined. It was remarked that I should have gone, because her daughter thought I was "cute." Well, the fireworks were pretty good, and the finale was excellent. So ended my Saturday. Sunday was hot, especially when I walked to work. I worked from 9-2, and nothing fun happened then. At 2, my mother gave me a ride to Kinney's to purchase Maddie a card. I then walked home and got changed and went to Maddie's party at Nicole's. It was about 2:30 when I got there. After Maddie badgered me for several minutes, I had some things to eat. The chicken was excellent. Over the course of the 7 hours I was there, I had alot of it. We played with sticky paddles and a really big tennis ball. We mostly talked, and I watched people swim. It was a blast, so to speak. Later on, we got a game of kickball going. It was fun too, and I did not get thrown out at second. After that, Bryan dropped me off at home. My parents were perturbed because I didn't tell them that I would be gone for so long. I showered and went to bed, and that was Sunday. Monday was fun also. I woke at about 8:30, repaired my Internet, and ate some ice cream for breakfast. At about noon, I went lifting with Trevor. After I got done with that, I came home and found out that I was able to go golfing with Kyle. That was a bunch of fun. I had never golfed before, and it was a good experience. I wasn't very good, but that didn't matter, neither was Kyle. I almost killed us on the golf cart, and I lost my grip once on the backswing when it was raining. It was hilarious. After we played 7 holes, Kyle took me home so I could get ready for work. I went to work, and that was not fun like golfing. Well, that was my weekend. Tomorrow morning driver's ed begins at 7:30. I should probably go to bed soon, but I more than likely won't.
Well, it's been a few days since I made an entry in this thing, but hey, I'm a busy man, I've got things to do. Well, let's see. Oh yes, Thursday morning. I got off to a good start, getting 9 hours of sleep. However, when I woke up, there was a problem. My leg, which had been injured the previous evening, had become very painful. I found myself unable to do more than walk, and even then I limped. After experiencing this, I can honestly say that "Limpin' Ain't Easy." I did need to walk several places during the day, but I was helped by a friend on one such journey. Bryan Jones picked me up and gave me a ride to McDonald's and home, which was awfully nice of him, and I am grateful that I did not have to walk that distance. Nothing interesting happened after that, except I struggled through 5 hours of work. That was basically all that happened on Thursday. Friday was slightly more fun. I once again got much sleep, roughly 10 hours worth. I sat around for an hour or two, then drove to get my check when my mother went to work. My driving was alright, although there was some room for improvement. I got my check and walked to the bank and deposited it, and then stopped by McDonald's again before going home. At about 1:00, Trevor came and we went lifting. When we got there, Kate Worden was there. Set a new personal record in the bench press, and had a pretty fun time lifting. After that, Trevor, Kate, and I went to the Pizzeria for pizza. Then I went home, and I went to work at 4. That was annoying and boring. When I got home, I learned that our shower was broken, and I had to help fix it. That was not fun. That was all of what happened the last two days. My leg feels better, but it's still not fully healed. I'll be alright. Ending this now.
i love the way we can hold hands, and it mean nothing more than friendship. i love the way we can talk. i love the way we can look at each other. i love the way we hug. i love the way we can be ourselves around each other. i love the way and all the ways we are together.
the last chapter of the fairy tale is over. forever in our memories, never far from thought. we all learned a lot about ourselves. the end. Las cienega just smiled... "see ya around" Y
i wish i could change the world. make everything the way i want it. but, then i guess it wouldn't be so "fun". you are still on my mind constantly. i think about the way you sit. the way you laugh. the way your lips move when you talk. i think about your gestures as if you were here with me right now in the same room. i wish you were. i just know i will never have the connection we have, with anyone else. and it tears me up to pieces inside my heart. no matter the akward silences, or anything. i just want to lean in and kiss you. like no one is watching. i want bear hugs. so big, you crush me a little. i want them to last forever. and have that feeling never go away. I'll stop the world and melt with you you've seen the difference and it'sgetting better all the time there's nothing you and I won't do I'll stop the world and melt with you
i felt fine today. why shouldn't i? it's not like we were more than what we were. i guess i thought it would hit me harder. since i take everything to heart, and fall too easily. at least i felt fine today. yesterday my stomach was churning at 100 miles per minute all day at work. i felt sick, and couldn't get the situation off my mind. i didn't tell you. i didn't want you to know. the sinking feeling didn't go away til i saw you. till i saw your eyes, and knew no matter what, i would be okay. i don't know why i get such a calming feeling when i'm around you. we had an instant attraction/friendship. but, i'm scared what i say will make you run the opposite way. but i need you in my life. not in that way, but in a best friend/big brother way. although, i am older. but, those are just details. i've been typing this entry for three hours. i'm reaching for all the right words. but they don't seem to be in reach. maybe i should stop while i'm ahead. i thought about you all day at work. everytime the phone rang, i hoped it was you. Take it back, take it all back now The things i gave, like the taste of my kiss on your lips, I miss that now I can't try any harder than i do All the reasons i gave, excuses i made for you Are broken in two All the things left undiscovered Leave me empty and left to wonderI need you All the things left undiscovered Leave me waiting and left to wonder I need you Yeah I need you Don't walk away Y
i don't hate you. i don't blame me or you. i will keep all my promises. i would never break a promise, especially to you . it just means it was one more night of making us closer. we make mistakes, we are human. i'm glad i got to know you that way. my heart does hurt, but just a little . you made a long drive, for me. i'm glad you did it. your eyes are still amazing. it's like reading a book when staring into them. but i can't look too long, or my emotions will take over. i've never looked into a friends eyes like i do yours. i wish more people were able to feel what i feel when i do. just don't ever forget. And I hold you close in the back of my mindFeels so good but damn it makes me hurtAnd I'm too scared to know how I feel about you nowLas cienega just smiled... "see ya around"
don't hurt it.
i still get tingles thinking about it. even butterflies in my tummy. things went better than expected. the connection was so wonderful. i want to live the last hour over and over again. just when life is going normal, you are thrown a curve ball. i held on to the curve ball. as it whisked me around. from one thing to the next. i want to do it all over again. and not change anything about it. over and over. how can we keep this simple. you held my hand and walked me home why you gave me that kiss it was somethin like this and made me go oh oh you wiped my tears got rid of all my fears why did you have to go guess it wasn't enough
journal whore? yes.

A soul mate doesn't necessarily have to be a love partner. A soul mate can be a parent, a sibling, a best friend, a helpful neighbor, a favorite teacher, or simply a compassionate stranger who helps youat a time of great need, then disappears from your life.

haha, hey ya'll, i know i said i wouldnt be on til the schoool year starts, but, i took a test or something and figured i'd forget the results if i tried to do it later, so here it is: You are Form 0, Phoenix : The Eternal. "And The Phoenix's cycle had reached zenith, so he consumed himself in fire. He emerged from his own ashes, to be forever immortal." Some examples of the Phoenix Form are Quetzalcoatl (Aztec), Shiva (Indian), and Ra-Atum (Egyptian). The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life, the number 0, and the element of fire. His sign is the eclipsed sun. As a member of Form 0, you are a determined individual. You tend to keep your sense of optomism, even through tough times and have a positive outlook on most situations. You have a way of looking at going through life as a journey that you can constantly learn from. Phoenixes are the best friends to have because they cheer people up easily.

No, not really :) I had a good day today. The day went by very quickly. Maybe that was because I slept until 4pm. I woke up, looked at the clock and said "Holy crap!! I have to be at rehearsal in 3 hours." I've never slept that late before without having been awake until 8am in the morning(which I've done many times before :). It's probably the reason why I'm awake now :) Anyway, rehearsal was great. We were supposed to run all the blocking for Act 1 but only got through the first scene because we were polishing everything. It's looking great. Ro and I have done a good job so far, if I do say so myself :) After rehearsal, I hung out with Ro and we watched a couple episodes of "Dead Like Me", which is an awesome show. I watched it a couple of weeks ago on Showtime On Demand and I told Ro "You so will love this show. You've got to watch it." Do I have good taste or what? Of course, it's easy for Ro to like something. He's a loser!!! I'm writing all this because I know he's going to read it :p Anyway, I have to get up in 4 1/2 hours so I'm heading for bed. Ben Folds in 17 hours. Report after the concert tomorrow!!!!!! Yes!!!!!! More later..........
Tonight I went with my family to my dad's cousin's house. We went to do some visiting and some swimming. The water was too cold for me which sucks because I wanted to try out my new bathing suit. Ah, well. My niece, Shaylee, went into the pool for the first time. She loved it. She had an absolute blast. We had a good time. Grilled some burgers, listened to her husband talk about Farenheit 9/11, recalled good old times with my sister. I had a good time but then I started thinking about things that have been getting me down lately and I kind of brought myself down, so I called it a early night. I came home and watched Road Rules and then Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. I really think I'm getting better at picking myself up when I'm down. I was watching RR and started feeling better right away. Either that or I'm just getting over being hurt....finally. It only took me a month after the fact to start getting better. That's something my sister and I were talking about. She said to me "f your ex was here, he'd probably be sitting next to you instead of being with the guys talking about that movie because it would still be early in the relationship. What, like a month and a half, right?" . "Yes" I told her. "Can we drop it please? It's already hard enough for me without you bringing it up." I've figured it out with the help of my sister that since I'm not sure exactly what ended the whole thing, that is the reason I've been so down. I've just been racking my brain with what I could have done wrong. It doesn't help the fact that everyone I know still asks me about him and says that(even though we dated for like three weeks) we were a cute couple and seemed to be happy together. The one thing that kills me is when people who think they're being helpful say "You're both so sad lately, ever since you decided to not see each other anymore." Okay people. Not my decision. Totally his. I just didn't want to ruin any fragment of feeling he might have for me by being a bitch. I have a feeling I was, though. I also feel that all my stress from theatre stuff didn't help it any either. He probably won't talk to me again. I'm dealing with it. I know now that he just didn't feel the same about the relationship situation as I did. It's a part of life. We deal with the cards we're dealt. I know that, hopefully , in a few months, I'll be able to watch Family Guy, look at the sofas at the theatre, and sit on Ro's futon without feeling sad. I digress. If I don't get better, I'm moving to Boston to live with my dad's family :) Move away and on from everything. I'm talking about this because it's better out than in. On a happier note, Ben Folds on Wed!!!!!!! Hooray!!!! More later!!!!!
Well, I've been offline for over a week because our computer had several viruses on it. Being the lazy, busy person I am, I had no time to find a computer to do anything on. I am now typing on our brand new computer. I was told that I could have the old one if we can get it cleaned up and running again. Some weird, kind of sad news: I have been diagnosed with having depression. I'm not all that surprised. I've been rundown lately and not in the mood for much of anything. My parents are concerned about me being like this. There are certain things that would perk me up but alas, I won't be receiving my wish anytime soon. I knew there was something wrong when I was watching Adam Sandler movies last week and not laughing at all. Well, that's not entirely true. I watched Billy Madison(my favorite) and laughed my ass off. I've never watched that movie with anyone else, just by myself. There are only a few people that are allowed to watch that movie with me. They can probably guess who they are, but I won't reveal names :P Anyway, the depression thing. Even theatre hasn't picked me up. Cuckoo's Nest opened on Friday. I got depressed thinking that I won't get any flowers during this show because I never get flowers from anybody. Not even when I was directing Birdie last year. Silly things like that get me near tears. I was out with my family and we were talking about going to my cousin's house to visit and use the pool tomorrow and I was sad because I'm odd man out again, as I always am. My sister and her boyfriend, Mom and Dad, the baby and the dog. And me, by myself. Things like that are so stupid, I can't believe they make me upset. I've been thinking about getting away for a while but I can't because of my committments to rehearsal for Stage Door and then performances for Cuckoo's Nest. I would go somewhere quiet with the one person who means a lot to me, but, of course, I don't even have that anymore.... See, I depress myself and now others. Argh!!!! :) Sorry for being this way. I think a lot of events have led up to me being this way. Running myself ragged with Ride The Winds, board stuff, having been hurt by so many people in the past three months, being hurt by someone I didn't think would hurt me, having my heart broken not once but twice in four months.....So many things. People tell me that I have to move up and on. Well, I would love to be able to freeze my feelings but it's not possible. As I told someone last week who also dealing with a lot of crap "Well, at least the person you care about is still there to listen. And you have someone willing to love you and listen no matter what". I hate to admit it but it's true. My friends love me but they are so tired of my crap, they've stopped listening. I have no one who cares enough to listen. I hopefully can go see a therapist to help me with deal with everything. No, I'm not suicidal. My friends seem to think I'll be back to my normal self when I'm done being hung up on things. My outlook on life has changed so much. I don't think I'll ever be the wonderful person I was a year ago. I meet people now who think I'm crazy bitch and I think to myself "I would love for them to have met me last year when my life made sense." Well, I'm off to bed. I'm not crazy, I swear. Just a little blue...... but then, who isn't, once in a while? :) More later.........

Well, with nothing to do since my best friend ditched me, I stayed home tonight and watched the rest of "Say Anything". I love this movie and not just because it has John Cusack :) I think the movie tells a wonderful story about how love will hit you when you're not expecting it. It also shows how love can conquer all and how it's always nice to have someone there to support you when everything blows up in your face. Every girl should have a boyfriend like Lloyd Dobler. He's persistent and doesn't give up easily in the pursuit of love..... Why aren't there more men like him? :) I was hoping I had someone like him but I was sadly mistaken. Que sera, sera. More later......... P.S. I MISS YOU!!!!!!
Okay, lately, I've been on a Hoobastank kick. Their music is sooo awesome. The words are heartfelt. You can really hear his pain and joy in every word he sings. Plus, right now, the songs express how I feel recently. Hopefully, some people can take hints from that. On another note, our first rehearsal for Stage Door went very well. Our cast is amazing and they will all be so much fun to work with. Cuckoo's Nest is going well also. Tonight Ro was bitching at me onstage about my entrance in the beginning of the 2nd act. "Why are you coming in? What's your purpose?" I told him to leave me alone and that I was coming to work. Kathe backed me up on that one. After a few minutes, Ro was his normally, sort of sane person. "What's happening, hot stuff?" Yada, yada, yada :) Dodgeball(the movie) tomorrow night, I hope....... More later.

urlLink Shaylster, me,and Mickey!!! I look like crap!!! Hey, that's on like 4 hours of sleep!!!
Can't sleep again so I ended up watching Punch Drunk Love which was a very interesting movie. I love Adam Sandler and he never ceases to amaze me with the characters he plays. So right now, I'm on an Adam Sandler kick. I'm finding which of his movies I haven't seen and setting out to see them. The only ones I haven't seen are: Going Overboard, Airheads, Bulletproof, Little Nicky, and Eight Crazy Nights. Yes, I've seen all the others. I own most of them with the exception of Big Daddy, The Waterboy, and 50 First Dates. The last one I'm getting soon. It's my favorite AS movie so far. I say that about all his new movies though. They continually get better. I have to watch all of Big Daddy and The Waterboy and determine whether I want to buy them. Word of advice to anyone: Check out "Mixed Nuts". It's one of his earlier movies. It actually stars Steve Martin but he's in it and he's hilarious. It's one of my all time favorite movies. Goodness, I must be really tired. I keep going on about Adam Sandler :) Well, he is good........ More later!!!! P.S. I STILL MISS YOU :p
Here it is, 4 o' clock in the fricking morning and I can't get to sleep. Good lord, someone hit me over the head with a frying pan, please :) In my insomnia, I put all my laundry away and watched 'Love, Actually' which was actually very good and very cute and oh so sweet in some places. Today I had my niece's birthday party which I was late to since I didn't get to sleep until 6:30 am yesterday(Sunday morning). It was fun especially for the baby. The party was at a park so we played on the playground, swung on the swings, and seed on the sawed. I, seriously, don't know what I just said :) It was great. I got some pictures with my sweetie of a niece, Shaylee, who is 1 year old today(June 14th). That's all I did. Pretty boring day. I was supposed to go to a line run but I didn't since it wasn't mandatory. I've been at the theatre a lot lately and will continue to be there much, much more in the two weeks to come, since I have Cuckoo's Nest and Stage Door rehearsals to handle. Plus, I found out that I might have to handle our first rehearsal by myself on Wednesday if Cuckoo's Nest isn't halfway decent tomorrow night. If we're not so good, we have rehearsal on Wednesday and Kathe needs Ro since he's the lead. Oh, well. If I have to run it myself, I can do it. I've directed before. Piece of cake....... I think :) Now, I'm tired. The plumber is coming to fix our sink in like 4 hours. Drat!!! No sleep til Brooklyn, I guess :) More later...... Happy Birthday to the Shaylster!!!!!
Everything is a blur to me. All I know is that I had a lot of fun tonight. It kills me because I tattled on Mark for drinking during intermission and I was drinking with him after we left Silver Diner. I saw my friend Steve tonight. Haven't seen him since about a month ago. Some people thought he was my boyfriend because he was super friendly with me. No way. I love Steve but not like that. It would take a lot more for me to love someone like that. I hope Martin got home okay, as well as Mark and Ryan. I had an awesome time. Lot of fun, lots of laughs. I wish I had known how much fun Martin and Mark were like two weeks ago. We could have done this sooner :) More later........
Well, I can't think of titles so I'll jsut use random words. I decided insanity would be a good word because of "Cuckoo's Nest". Friday night it was and our second to last performance of RTW. Afterwards, we went to Rocky Run in Columbia. I was doing good until "he" walked in. He had said he was coming but it was like an hour after we got there, I figured he wasn't coming. My heart jumped in my throat, as it normally does. It's silly for me to feel like that when 6 weeks ago I thought it was a bad idea to get involved with him. I should have listened to my gut instinct but I felt something special about him, so I gave him a chance. Where does it leave me? He's fine and happy-go-lucky and I'm depressed and wishing I hadn't listened to my best friend. I'm going to be so sad when the show ends tomorrow night. I know I won't be able to give him a hug or I'll start crying. Ah, well. He probably wouldn't want to hug me anyway, seeing as he treats me like I have lepercy or something. 'Tis my life. Sad, ain't it? :) More tomorrow.....Will she cry or not? Stay tuned........
Saw Harry Potter with Ro, Ryan, Tim, and Robin last night. I can actually remember some things from the movie now. I really liked the dementias. They were very creepy. The movie had it's funny moments. Emma Thompson was funny as the Divinations teacher and I especially liked the actor who played Professor Lupin, though I can't remember his name. Saw some ads for some interesting movies also. A Cinderella Story looks very good. Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray in a modern day Cinderella Story, natch. After the movie was over, we stood outside and talked for a while about all the theatre crap that's going on. It's driving Ro and myself to the edge, nuff said. We were going to go and hang somewhere else but Ryan has a new job I'm sure he doesn't want to be fired from and Robin also had to work today, so Tim naturally had to go with her since he came with her. That's all I can remember. I have to email my bio for "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" to Maureen. Tim asked me to write his bio last night. I'm not sure if he was serious or not, so I'm going to write it and see if he likes it. More later..........
Another great performance of Ride the Winds yesterday afternoon. Albeit I heard some stuff I didn't want to hear but since I didn't hear it from the person who supposedly said it, I'm going to give that person the benefit of the doubt and hope they didn't say it :) Are you following me yet? Anyway, after the show, I wasn't planning on going to the cast party since I was in a crappy mood(when am I ever not lately :). Ro and Kathe convinced me to go and it was nice. I swung on the swings and I felt the best I've felt in two weeks. After that, auditions. We were hoping to hopefully get more kids than we did on Saturday. Our wish came true. It was 6:50 and we already had 20 kids. I turned to Ro and said "It's only 6:50". When we started auditions at 7:15, we had 92 people in the building. Our auditions took over 3 hours and we've only so far cast the guy parts. We'll work on the girls tomorrow, hopefully. After auditions, we went back to my house to drop off the dog and pick up the tape I taped the Tonys on for my dear friend, Ro. Then back to Ro's for Tony time. Shhhh! No talking :) For those of you who don't know, Ro is my best friend. He's like a brother and one of the only people who doesn't treat me like shit. Anyway, it took forever to get the tape to rewind because the tape was crappy. We finally got the idea to run the tape and rewind it while it was playing. Tony night is like Oscar night, in the fact that there's no talking when the awards are on. The opening number was great. For those of you who care, more highlights: Fiddler #-Tradition; Tony Bennett sang "Lullaby of Broadway"; number from Caroline, or Change-Wow; Wicked # was good; Carol Channing did a rap with LL Cool J and she still has it; Wonderful Town #-loved it, wanna see it; Assassins was good; Best Director of a Musical went to Assassins; Popular Comic Actor Jimmy Fallon was funny; Avenue Q # awesome gotta see it; Phylicia Rashad won for her role in "Raisin in the Sun" what a wonderful woman, totally deserved it; The Boy From Oz # was cool, Hugh Jackman was great; Best Revival of a Play went to Henry IV; Best Revival of a Musical went to Assassins; Best Play went to I Am My Own Wife which is one guy playing over 40 roles; Best Actress in a Musical went to Idina Menzel from Wicked; Hugh Jackman won Best Actor in a Musical; and then Best Musical went to Avenue Q, whose producers were very very surprised. I think it was totally deservant of the Tony. I've never watched the Tonys before. They were great. Being a big fan of plays and musicals, I loved the musical numbers and will def. watch the Tonys again!!!!! More tomorrow night after I get back from Gavin!!!!!!!!! Yes!!!!! Gavin DeGraw...........
Today we had auditions for Stage Door, the summer youth production we're doing this year. We had a pretty decent turnout for the first day of auditions. I think we'll have an excellent cast. Ro and I are very excited about doing the show. I'm excited because the last show I directed was "Bye Bye Birdie" over a year ago. I'm also excited because directing a show takes up much of my time and that'll be nice. I've been lonely and a little blue and feeling like I haven't had much to do in the past two weeks since the "incident". If you know me, you'll know what the "incident" is :) Tonight we had an excellent performance of Ride The Winds. Tomorrow is our last matinee and also a cast party at Susan's. Fun,fun!!!!!!More later........ P.S. I MISS YOU :(
Okay. I've seen this movie twice now. I think I can fairly remember all the gory details. Actually, I can't :) Steve asked me today what my favorite part was and I couldn't think of anything that stood out. I can remember the people I saw it with(Michelle on Thursday and Ryan on Friday)but nothing else :) I remember someone saying they didn't get the end. It was very understandable, I thought. I can't explain it without giving stuff away. Oh well. I'm probably going to dragged along next week when Ro and Tim go to see it. Maybe I can post about it then. For now, I must sleep because I have auditions tomorrow or later today rather. TTFN
Today I woke up and went to a job interview, which went pretty well. Then I went home and fell asleep again(I've been doing that alot lately) until it was time for me to drive Ro back to Bel- Air. Yes, I am an extremely nice friend. Normally, i wouldn't have driven him but I have no life and he was giving me gas money. We talked about all the theatre crap on the way up there(1 1/2 hours because of traffic!!!) and about auditions. The "Board" came up with the brilliant idea of charging the actors to be in the summer show. It ain't happening. That's all I have to say. Anyway, we dropped Simon off and came back. Ro went on his merry way with Kathe and I went home. Surprise, surprise. There was no one home so I went to pick up my tickets for Harry Potter tomorrow night at Muvico. I figured since I was there and had nothing else to do, I'd go see a movie. Shrek 2 it was. Maybe I'm just in a funky mood but I didn't find it that funny. I'm sure when I'm in a better mood, it'll be hysterical to me. The story was good and there were lots of pop culture references. I will probably see it again, I'm sure. After I stopped at Ro's to just chill, I came home. I was going to stay at Ro's since he's out of town and has no problem with me being there but I decided to come home and sleep in my own bed. I'll probably stay there tomorrow night since the movie won't end until like 3am. That way I don't have to drive home. I still don't have anyone to go with me to the movie. These are the problems of a crazy person!!!!!!! :) More later.........
Hey. Thanks to all who have decided to come and visit my blog. I know several people that have one and decided that I'd like to have one too :) Don't worry. Mine will not have the nastiness that certain people's blogs do. I'm going to use my blog to keep people updated on my life, theatre and otherwise. Mostly theatre, I'm sure, since that's mainly what my life consists of :) I chose Kenzo's World because it's a nickname of mine that I actually like. My "brother" Ro gave it to me right after I started calling him Rory. For those of you that only slightly know me, let me tell you some more :) 24, single, love theatre, tv, and movies. Best TV shows: Simpsons, Taxi, Futurama, Family Guy, That 70's show, Cheers, and Wings. Also Monty Python and anything British comedy. Great movies include anything done by Mel Brooks or Kevin Smith. Also Sixteen Candles, Goodfellas, Say Anything, Tombstone, Bridget Jones' Diary, and anything with Adam Sandler. I love to laugh, though I haven't been doing much of it lately :( Long story. Send me something if you want to know. I'm a very kooky person and my life goal is to be happy with the right things and the right someone, who I'm waiting to be ready for me. Actually, if I have the right person, when he's right, I don't need a lot of stuff. That's all for now. I have rehearsal shortly and must get ready. TTFN!!!!!!
Wow. What an awesome show. I've never seen the show before nor did I know what it was about. It was sensational. I hope that Stage Door is just as good. When I dropped Ro off at his apartment, Ro, Kathe, and myself were all talking about musicals. I argued that musicals do have their place. Kathe disagreed. She's not a big fan of the musical. Ro, of course, loves them. I like ones that make sense. You know, things that could actually happen or have happened. This is why I despise CATS. Never could happen. My three cats don't sing and dance. Now, maybe, if the actors portraying the cats had more cat-like things. Like licking themselves whenever the spirit moved them or maybe plopping down in the middle of a number or leaving a dead small animal at your feet. Maybe then I'd see it. Ragtime was great!!! Set constrution tomorrow(Saturday) and Sunday all day. Well, tomorrow, Ro and I have my Daddo's 50th birthday party. Kathe is meeting us there. Ro and I are leaving the theatre about 2:30, 2:45. But then it's back there at 11 am on Sunday for finishing up on the set, cleaning the theatre, and Q 2 Q. If anyone wants to stop by and help, you're more than welcome. We can always use extra hands. I feel like a total goober right about now. I was on my way home tonight after dropping off Ro, and I started thinking about an ex-boyfriend(not saying which one) and about how he always made me so sexually aware of myself. I never slept with any of my boyfriends. Well, I slept with them but not in "that" way :) Now I'm making myself sound like a tramp. Well, those of you that know me, know that I'm not. You also know how many person I've slept with and how dreadful that was :) The boyfriend I was thinking of I never got a chance to "sleep" with, though, I wish I had. I regret it a lot sometimes. Like I say, que sera sera. Whatever will be, will be. More later......
God, some the stuff at the theatre is ridiculous. Everyone is fighting about petty things. Doesn't anyone understand the real reason we're all here? It's because of our love for this theatre. I would hate to see this theatre not work and have to shut down. It seems like everyone in this fight has forgotten that reason. People ask me if I want to act. The answer is "No". Yes, I like to be on stage. It's fun. My favorite thing to do is stage manage. Running lights isn't bad either. If I could, I would like to be a stage manager for a professional company if the teacher thing didn't work out. I live for working backstage. It's great, wonderful, and fun. You get to boss people around. That's always fun :) Tonight, the s**t hit the fan. Ro and I were getting yelled at by both sides about the program. It pisses me off how certain people want us on their side but they don't trust that we'll do the right thing. I know that they don't trust me at all and also for a fact that I am talked about behind my back. "Well, if she did that, how do we know she won't do it again?" I don't want to be a board member. I just want to do my artistic thing and be done with it. If I'm not trusted by them, why should I stay on their side? I won't go over to the other side either. I'd like to be neutral but it's too late for that. It's all bullshit. Nobody is doing what's in the best interest of the theatre. They all think they are but it's not true. Ro and I are screwed where this show is concerned. Both sides expect us to do what they say. We have personal ties on one side, veiled threats on the other. IT'S ALL CRAP!!! Just let us do what we came to do: Direct. I'm doing this for those kids. I'm not directing this show for anybody else. And I'll be damned if I let someone tell me how to cast my show. If you wanted a certain cast, you should have volunteered to direct it!!!! I also don't need or want directing notes from someone that doesn't know what they're doing in the first place and let's their actors dictate the blocking to them. I just had to get that off my chest. I feel so alone when it comes to this theatre stuff. I wish I had someone to vent to. Bad thing about not being in a relationship: No one to talk to about stupid things. Well, I can talk to my friends but we always argue. Anyway, the theatre is not the best thing for me all the time. It's ruined relationships with family members, friends, and boyfriends. In the past 8 months, I have had some much stuff thrown at me that my attitude has become worst and has made me a bitch at times. Ride the Winds was a show that I loved doing but working with Bill, who is on the other side, wasn't the easy thing. He would get on my case about choosing sides and a lot of other nonsense. Then I would take it out on actors who were my friends and who only want the best for me. My being a bitch ruined something good that I had going. I'm glad that I learned through that experience not to let theatre enter my personal relationships with my family and friends. I leave my problems at the door. So far, Stage Door has been wonderful. I don't let any of that bullcrap affect my rappaport with the actors. As does Ro. We treat those kids with the utmost respect. I love each and every one of them. I wish I could back and fix anything that was ruined during Ride the Winds but I can't. What's done is done. Anyway, my questions from yesterday. Bobby Eddowes was my first boyfriend and like I said, the sweetest guy I ever knew until my last boyfriend, who was as sweet as honey and just as cute as a teddy bear. Fave beer? Either Molson or Heiniken(sp?). Two favorite bands? Well, I have many faves. Let's see Barenaked Ladies, Foo Fighters, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Weezer, The Strokes, Green Day, to name a few. Movie posters on my wall? Sixteen Candles, Say Anything, Tombstone, Empire Records, Mallrats, Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, Mixed Nuts. New questions for today. Only a few will know this. First show I ever was in at Burtonsville Players/ Laurel Mill Playhouse? First show I directed? Where am I ticklish?My first crush on a celebrity/sports figure? What color is my car? Okay. Bed. Ro and I are going to see Rameen in Ragtime tomorrow night. That should be fun!!!!! More later........
Nothing exciting or of any interest happened today. I just went to the Dining Room read through and that's about it. I will answer my questions from yesterday. Fave hockey team? New Jersey Devils. Fave baseball: New York Mets. Fave football: New England Pats. I liked the Pats before they won the Super Bowl. I'm not jumping on the bandwagon. Hopefully, I can go to my first pro football game this fall. Did I graduate high school? Well I got my GED. It's a long story, better for in person. Any other schooling? No. Didn't have the money. Three animated shows I live for? Family Guy, Futurama, and the Simpsons. New questions: The name of my first boyfriend and the 11 year old boy I compare all guys to? J/K. I don't do that, though he was the sweetest guy I ever knew until my third boyfriend came along :) Favorite beer? Name two of my favorite bands?Name two movie posters I have on my wall (sorry, if you've never been to my house :) . I'll answer all the questions tomorrow. Now, I'm going to eat some pizza and watch porn :) No, I'm going to watch Serendipity.I'm looking for something to do Friday and Saturday nights. Any suggestions?More later.........
Don't you hate when that happens? Real quick post because it's raining outside and I want to go get cozy under my comforter and watch Happy Gilmore :) Rehearsal went pretty good tonight until the damn roof started leaking when the rain started. Hopefully, it won't be pouring tomorrow during rehearsal. I'll keep my fingers crossed. We have acostume parade tomorrow night plus we have to clean Act 3, Scene 1. It looked awful tonight. We'll take it slowly tomorrow and get everythingfixed that needs to be. Rameen isdoing a wonderful job. He's already off book.I hope we can get someone like that forJimmy :) Anyway, rehearsal tomorrow night. If anyone's ever in the area, you're more than welcome to stop by. It's always nice to see an adult face :)There is also a rehearsalfor the Dining Room(whichI'm stage managing) but obviously, Stage Door rehearsal comes first. Ihave to get something off my chest right now. There's alot of crap going at the theatre. Unfortunately, my parents and I are all involved at the theatre. We're all on Kathe's side but sometimes my dad will get on my case about something that I know nothing about. It's just all crazy. I'm still at the theatre because without it, I would be nothing. The theatre made me who I am today. Seven years ago, I was the shyest, quietest person ever. Now I'm still shy and quiet but I will be more bold in doing things. I'm going to watch Happy Gilmore. Before I do, the answers to yesterday's questions: Rory and The Real World: San Diego. I miss it on Tuesdays now. Ifeel like a gooberbecause I always used to say you wouldn't catch me watching that show but it's so addictive :) Questions for today: Favorite sports team in hockey? Baseball? Football? No basketball. I'm not a big fan of b-ball. Second question: Did I graduate from high school? If so,didI get any schooling afterwards? Third question :Three animated shows that I live for? Answers tomorrow!!!! Until then, Happy Gilmore here I come. More later.......
Stage Door rehearsal went great tonight. We had a reporter and photographer from the Gazette there. She asked the kids lots of questions and they all had a good time answering them and being silly. Unfortunately, we've lost another male actor due to sports. Does anyone out there want to act? It's real easy. One little scene in the 1st act. That's it. Anyway, let me know if you know of anyone. We only made it to the middle of Act 2 due to the late start. Ro is going to Pennsylvania with Timmy tomorrow so I'm running rehearsal by myself. Well, I'll have Stu. I know we can get through the whole show in 2 1/2 hours. We just need to pick up the pace a little. Wed, we have a costume parade and individual work. I'm working with someone and Ro's working with someone. One-on-one. The actress I'm working with just needs more of a shy, kind of sensitive touch to the character. I'm trying to decide how to approach this in a way she'll understand. On a happy note, Rameen and Tim have joined our cast as Sam Hastings. Rameen is doing the first three weekends, Tim the last weekend. We have a week and a half to get someone in who can learn the lines and blocking of Jimmy Deveraux. I'm praying it happens. Keeping my fingers crossed :) My questions last night in the blog were a little weird and maybe too personal. Only my best friend would know when I lost my virginity. Fave Kevin Smith movie? Mallrats!!!! Better questions : My best friend is who? MTV show I've hated to miss this season? How boyfriends have I had? I'll answer that last one right now since it's easy. The answer is 3. Have I ever had a serious relationship? No, not really. By serious I mean long term. My longestrelationship was 3 months long and that's when I was 11. Seriously!!!! In one relationship I wasn't ready for seriousness; the other realtionship, he wasn't ready for seriousness.I always used to find that I thought I didn't have the time for serious relationships.Then I discovered that if someone is special enough to you, you make time for them. I've had (and stilldo have) alot of guy friends that neverpanned out to relationships.My closest friends are my guy friends. My whole life has been like that. Some people get the wrong impression of me. I'm hanging around, talking and laughing with guys, I come off as a flirt. I'm totallythe world's worstflirt. I suck at it. Ask any of my friends. I think I'm bad because I grew up with the understanding that the guy should make the first move. Well, that and thefact that I'm a little shy and I don't thinkI'm verypretty to get most guys' attention. Whatever!! I've just gone on along tangent. Crazy or what? Crazy!!!! I'm going to watch my Billy Madison DVD that I got today and hopefully fall asleep at a decent hour. Yeah, right!!! Normal sleep has escaped me for the past two months ever since all this crap started happening to me. Oh well!!! More later..........
urlLink Love Gavin. Don't care much for the hat. I bet he took thestickers off of it, though : ) urlLink
urlLink Gavin "Call me Yummy" DeGraw urlLink
No, not really. Just seems like it. Friday night, before the show, Michelle and I went to Baltimore to see Gavin DeGraw(an amazing singer) perform at the Baltimore Orioles summer concert series. He was so good as he always is. He does an amazing cover of Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On.". I wanted to take Rory to see Gavin but he didn't want to risk being late to get his black eye makeup and everything done. My makeup is regular makeup so it was no problem for me. Anyway, Rory loves Gavin too. He would have had a blast. Michelle had a good time. We left at 7 and made it to the theatre at 7:35. I had plenty of time to get into makeup and costume. After the show, we went to Bennigan's where I discovered that by alternating drinking soda and liquor, you won't get much of a buzz. Either that or my tolerance level is lower than it used to be. Saturday, had rehearsal at 2pm, hung around with Rory for a bit, went home to take a shower, went back to the theatre for the final performance of Cuckoo's. Kind of sad. In my first scene, I was talking to Omar who sits in the "Station" with me. Neither of us could believe that it was the last show. We both agreed that it seemed like the show had been going on for like 4 months. It was the first(and probably last) time I've ever had a really long convo with Omar. Usually, we would tease each other. He started calling me "Cupcake" after I wore a shirt that said that on it. After the show, we struck the set. Everyone had a couple of beers while doing it so it was a very loose set strike. The thing I will miss most about Cuckoo's is the cast. What an awesome group of guys!!!!! I love each and every one of them. I'm glad to have met these guys, especially Tim, Robin, and Jack. Tim is one of the funniest people I've ever met. He can totally distract you from your problems. Jack is very cool and interesting person. Robin is so sweet. Always a nice word. He called me sweetheart and at one point, was trying to set me up with his son, who's the same age as me. I hope I can work with all those guys again. After strike, we headed to Rocky Run. Kathe said she would buy us all dinner, which makes her an equally awesome director. I missed her getting her cast gift because I had to run home before going to Rocky Run. They knew I was on my way. Why they couldn't wait for me? I don't know. Anyway, today, set construction for Stage Door. We built half of the set and have the primer coat of paint and everything. The upstairs is all clean and we organized a boy's side and a girl's side. After set construction and some pizza(thanks to Stu), Ro, Tim, and I went to Ro's to watch "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" on DVD. I had never seen the whole movie. Ro tried to get Kathe to watch it with us but she refused. The movie was great. Ro and Tim didn't like the fact that they filmed parts right out of the play but those parts didn't make the final cut of the movie. I love watching movies at Ro's. He only has a TV in his bedroom so you're forced to get comfortable. I had to share the bed with Tim because Ro has this chair that only he can sit in. News flash, Rory!!! No one wants to sit in your stinky chair anyway : p Afterwards, we chatted for bit about theatre crap and then bid goodnight. I went home and managed to squeeze in some time with my niece, who was visiting. Luckily it's summer so my sis and her family goes home later on Sundays. I miss seeing my Shaylee. After Stage Door, I'll have more time to see her. Okay. I have paint all over my arms and legs but I'm exhausted. I'm torn between shower or bed. I'll decide eventually :) Oh, the answers to the questions I asked in my blog last week(See? I said that I would forget). Anyway, my middle name is Michelle and my eyes are grayish blue. Two other questions: Favorite Kevin Smith movie? How old was I when I was no longer a virgin? Rehearsal tomorrow night for Stage Door. We have to block in Rameen and Tim, who are replacing an actor we lost last week. Hooray!!!!! More later........
What a boring day!!! Got up about 11:30, did some laundry, washed my costume for Cuckoo's Nest(hey, those nurses uniforms get hot and icky under those lights), listened to some music, and spent a good 2 hours on the comp. typing in the bios of Stage Door. I said that I would do the program because I want to make sure none of the kid's bios get cut. They've all worked really hard. They deserve all the bio space they want. That reminds me of a story from rehearsal on Wed. A reporter from the Laurel Leader was there. Ro was talking to her and Mary asked if I was going to talk to her. I said "Mary, I don't do this to get my name mentioned anywhere. I do this summer program for you guys. That's the most important thing." When I said that, I realized that the Summer Youth Program is my one greatest accomplishment so far. I started the program in 1998 and with the exception of last year, I 've directed every production. I live for the summer program. Not many directors enjoy working with young people. I like it better than working with adults sometimes. Young actors are still learning their craft. They don't get big heads real easily, they also don't get all pompous. They will, I've learned, complain about their costumes. I think every actor hates at least one costume piece they have to wear. I know I have. I dislike the cap I wear in Cuckoo's, I despised the habit I wore in Blue Leaves, I barely tolerated thestrectchy head bandin Deadwood Dick. The one show I've done that I've loved my costumes was Betty's Summer Vacation. Since we went with product placement in that show, I wore my own Old Navy clothes. Plus, I got to wear my two piece on stage. When I first found out,I wasn't thrilled but it was so much cooler on stage in a bathing suit. Anyway, I love my kids in the summer program. People keep telling me to go and direct adults. I have. I directed Birdie last year. It was great but I work best with younger actors. That's why I'm going to be a teacher, people!!!!! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tonight we had brush up for Cuckoo's Nest. Since Cecily was missing,I filled in for her. Mary and I decided it would be fun toput on long ball gowns and be very high class hookers. Mary(for those who don't know) is a young actress I met in the fall. I cast her as the lead in the one act "Meet Virginia". Mary has an attitude that was very much the character. Mary is a great, great girl. We get along so well. She's like a younger sister. I love her to death. I have told her that I would cast in one of my shows in a heart beat. She's in Stage Door and she's amazing!!! Anyway, Mary and I were upstairs trying on dresses and giggling like 7 year olds. When our cue came, we climbed through the window on stage and had a ball :) There had been a rumor about going for cheesesteaks but we decided maybe another time. Instead, we went to Oliver's. Let me say that Tim is one crazy, hilarious guy. Whenever we go out, Tim is the life of the party. He has funny stories and crazy songs he sings. I hope that Tim and I get cast opposite each other in Our Town. I think we'd work very well together. I can only hope. Last two shows of Cuckoo's Nest this weekend. Come and see it if you haven't. We strike the set Saturday and that's always a blast. We usually party afterwards. Anyway, I've got stuff to do tomorrow. Supposed to see Gavin DeGraw in the summer concert series the Orioles have. He's supposed to perform before the O's game. Don't know if that's going to happen. I'd have to drag ass to the theatre for the show. Kathe says she's not starting without us. But it's supposedly going to rain and I hate trying to park in downtown Baltimore. Expensive!!!!! We'll see. Oh, since I'm so nice, Happy Birthday to Ryan!!!!!!!!!!!!! More later..........
I'm keeping this short since I feel kind of blah. Stage Door rehearsal tonight. Ro and I were able to fine tune a couple of scenes that we felt needed work. Rehearsal ended at 9 (our earliest end time so far this summer). I workedout some costumes for different people. Ro and I went to Friday's to meet up with his girlfriend. She got there and then I had to listen to them argue for a good 15 minutes. One thing I don't miss about a relationship? The fighting!!!! Ro is my best friend and I love his girlfriend too. But geez!! Luckily, they make up more than they fight so..... I decided to leave early. I came home, ate my late dinner, and played a little NHL 2002 on my PS2. It was relaxing but then I got so bored. Now, I'm going to my room, putting on some music, and trying to go to sleep. Will I get to sleep? No, probably not until like 3am. Too much stuff going on in my head!!!! Usually if the music doesn't work, I'll fall asleep watching TV. Tomorrow night, we have Cuckoo's rehearsal and then a possible road trip to Philly for some cheesesteaks. It was Tim's idea. He says it'll take like 2 hours to get up there. We'll see......
No, nothing bad happened. That was just the first thing to pop into my mind right at that moment. Tonight I went to Columbia Mall with a friend. It kills me how packed the mall is on the weekends but even in summer, it practically deserted on a weeknight. We're going up Route 29 to the Columbia Town Center exit and come up on all this traffic. Whoops!! Concert at Merriweather. So we go a different, less crowded way to get to the mall. We're passing all the traffic for MP and trying to remember who was playing tonight. I ask my friend to look and see what kind of age range there is, maybe we can figure out that way. Well, there's people from 15-60. It's driving us crazy so finally we call information, get the number for MP, and call and ask. It's Nickelback and 3 Doors Down. How could I have forgotten that? Iheard the announcement the other day when a radio station was giving away tickets. Duh!!! Anyway, we go to the mall, get something to eat and then walk around. We hit the Disney Store, Sam Goody, B Works, Nordstrom(where there was the cutest plaid mini for $23 and also the cutest salesman :) . I didn't get either. Couldn't afford the mini, didn't really want the salesman. I have other people on my mind right now. After Columbia, it was still early, so we decided to hit Arundel Mills. I never really buy anything. I just like to walk around the mall and observe people and things. It's fun. More fun when you have someone to walk with. We leave Arundel Mills passing Bass Outside World contemplating how hard it would be to steal one of those boats they leave outside. We have nothing to do so we decide to just drive around. Since my brain wasn't properly working on Monday, I remember that I have to get the bios I left at the theatre so I can start doing the program. We're there looking for the bios when I get a call on my cell from my friend a.k.a "little brother" Collin. He had just driven by the theatre and seen my car. He was parked outside. He comes in and we all chat for a bit. I can't believe that Collin is driving now. I met Collin in 2000 during "The Music Man". He was 12 at the time. Now he's 16 and looks all of 22. When we hang out, people think we're dating. No thanks!!! A little too illegal for my tastes :) Anyway, Collin is one of my favorite people in the whole world. I haven't seen him since the Main Street Festival. I got on his case about not keeping in touch more. I tried to convince him to be in Stage Door, since we lost an male actor on Monday. He can't do all the dates. He asked me about my love life. My friend said "Better not to touch that subject." Collin has been my friend through many numerous crushes and flirting games. He understands me very well. He was one of the first to know about my crush on Steve B. during Music Man. He also knows about the not so hot January and Februrary I had with Erin. For someone a good 8 years younger than me, he reads me like a book. That's what "little bros" are for, I guess. Anyway, he had to leave to be home for curfew or his mom would have his hide. I found my bios and drove my friend home. Came home myself, put away laundry, and watched TV. Now I'm writing in the blog. What an exciting day!!!! Can't wait for Friday!!!! Gavin DeGraw concert before the O's game. I will make Cuckoo's in time. They can't start without Michelle and I. The concert will be over in plenty of time. Here's hoping anyway :) To bed, to bed. Have to clean the bathroom tomorrow. Yuck!!!! Other than that, a day of sitting on my butt typing bios into my comp. I can hardly contain my excitement. Rehearsal tomorrow night for Stage Door. More later......
Cleaned up the old homestead today and while I was doing that, I watched Dazed and Confused. I love, love this movie. Now it's not my favorite movie but it's high up there. I mean it has an sweet soundtrack plus a London brother. I love the London brothers, Jeremy and Jason. Why? I'm not sure. I think it goes back to when I saw The Man in The Moon with Reese Witherspoon and Jason London. So now, I'll deem a movie watchable if there's a London brother in it. Mallrats-Jeremy; Out Cold-Jason; Dazed-Jason; To Wong Foo-Jason. Jason is my more favorite of the two. He is the better actor and the one who's in movies. Jeremy does a lot of TV. Wow!!! Look at me go on about the London brothers. I'm sorry. They're just really nice guys : ) Anyway, after I cleaned my room, I was bored so I decided to take some pictures of it. To see what my humble abode looks like, you can go to: urlLink http://www.msnusers.com/3o910moa7koq6jogh656aiaic6/documents.msnw?fc_a=0fc_p=%2FPictures%2FKendra%27s%20Room Yes, I'm kooky. I'm usually very bored all day. If anybody ever wants to come over and hang, that's cool. I have lots of movies and digital cable : ) Anyway, I'm taking a shower before heading off to the mall. More later......
when I can't think of a title for a post :) I'm usually more creative than this. Whatever!!!! My brain cells are going down. It's from hanging around all the smokers that I do. Well, that and the alcohol. Of course, I don't drink that much so maybe it's not that :) We had Stage Door rehearsal tonight. We were supposed to run the whole show but since we got started late due to a parents meeting we only got to Act 3, Scene 1. But we did the curtain call so that's one less thing to worry about. Whew!!! I also saw some Ride the Winds people tonight(Susan and Ryan), which I wasn't expecting. If you guys read this, sorry I wasn't more talkative but it was a little crazy tonight : ) After rehearsal and after arguing with Ro about something (he thought something that I thought was wrong and could never happen because wishes don't come true), I drove Ro home but then I had to go back to the theatre because I forgot some papers that we needed. So I'm leaving the theatre and I get a phone call from a friend. I'm sitting in front of the theatre chatting on my cell phone for a good 20 minutes. Yes, I could have driven and talked at the same time but I wasn't in a hurry to get anywhere. I was on my way home when I realized I forgot something else so I headed back to the theatre. Then I had to stop at the store and get some food. Now, I'm going to eat and call it a night. A lot of stuff is running through my mind right now so hopefully I can sleep. I'll just let the sounds of Route 29 lull me to sleep :) If anybody reading this is free the weekend of July 31st and August 1st, we could use some help building the set. Thanks!!!! Tomorrow night, I have nothing so I'm hitting Columbia Mall with a friend. More later......
or so I'm told. Last matinee for "Cuckoo's" today. It went surprisingly smooth except for Steve putting his hands all over me on the "Sweet thing" line. Total surprise!!!! After the matinee, there was a little cocktail party at Cafe de Paris in Columbia. The whole cast was there, well, except Gary and Ken. It was great fun. I had a Bass Ale and then a screwdriver. I had a bit of a buzz when we sat down to eat dinner. I didn't have anything because that place is expensive. Anyway, after that, we kind of hung around and chatted theatre stuff. Kathe and Michelle were discussing casting for the Dining Room. Ro suggested we all go to his place and discuss it. While Kathe and Michelle discussed, Ro and I watched "Viva La Bam". That show is crazy, but so fricking hilarious!!!!!! Afterwards, I went home but couldn't sleep so I went out and drove around for a while. I was in Laurel and stopped at the theatre. I tried to sleep on one of the couches upstairs but those things are uncomfortable even for a 5'5" person like myself. I knew this already from a past experience but I figured since I couldn't sleep in my bed, maybe an uncomfortable couch was the answer. It wasn't. I was tired of driving around so I got one of the many decks of cards from Cuckoo's and played some solitaire. I hate that game. I totally suck at it. Blackjack, WAR, Asshole, and Go Fish are more my games. That way you can accuse people of cheating : p Even Uno is a better game than solitaire. Anyway, long story short (too late), I got bored and came home. I'm now writing in this blog and I'm exhausted, finally. I've decided to make my blog more interesting. I'm going to ask questions about myself to see how well my friends(which hopefully all of you are) know me. First question, what's my middle name? Second question, what color are my eyes? I'll post the answers in the next blog and when you read it, you can say "Now there's something I didn't know". It sounds like a good idea now but I know it'll never work. I'll forget to do it. But let us pretend like it will work and answer the fricking questions : ) More later.............
I haven't had a drink in like two weeks, mostly because I've been fighting a cold. Tonight after the show, we went to Bennigan's. I ordered a screwdriver. Maybe it's because I didn't really eat anything all day but I got really weird. I can honestly say that I love drunk Kendra. It's the usual me, just a little more uninhibited. So word of advice : You want me to do something crazy, get me a drink. I love being crazy. I'm just less shy when I've been drinking. I also tend to run my mouth off more and I'll say things I didn't mean to let slip out, like most drunk people. I was fine to drive home as I usually am. I took my drunken time to go over some odd things that have happened to me in the past few days. A drunken reflection if you will. I'm a little sad my buzz is wearing off. I wish I had a party to go to or something but I have a matinee tomorrow. Aw, crap. But on the bright side, cocktail party afterwards. Hooray!!!!!!! I'm still in search of a "Parchessi" partner. More later.......
Why do I keep hitting my knee on this stupid desk? I just did it again. God, I'm getting retarded :) Either that or senile. Do you ever have one of those days where you get nothing done that you wanted to do? Well, that was my day. I sat at home and watched "I love the 90's" on Vh1. It's pretty funny. Then, of course, I took a shower and headed to the theatre for what seems like the 18th week of Cuckoo's Nest. I love the show, don't get me wrong, but it seems like it's been going on forever. Maybe it's because I'm usually hanging by myself upstairs when I'm not on. I wish Ride the Winds was still going on. At least then, I was always doing something. We have a matinee this Sunday. If there was no matinee, I might have gone to OzzFest. They have some good bands this year. My only problem is that it's at Nissan and I hear traffic is a nightmare. Ah, whatever, I can't go anyway. A side note, a lot of my friends have been odd lately. I feel like a lot of people around me are treating me like garbage. I hope I didn't do something mean or nasty. It bothers me when people don't tell me what their problem with me is exactly. It'll drive me crazy for days :) Oh, I have to get up to get costumes out of storage and other fun stuff before rehearsal at 2 tomorrow. I better get to sleep. More later........
I got a responseabout my post the other day about my needing a "Parchessi" partner. Person who responded: All I have to say to you is "Okay". You know where to find me if you're serious ; p I dare you
urlLink Jen and me at the wave pool. We're bathing beauties. I can see how people think she's my older sister. urlLink
urlLink My sweetie, Shaylee. You can't see but that's a Red Sox hat she's wearing. She has good taste :) urlLink
Yesterday I went to Six Flags with my sister, Rob, Shaylee(my niece), and my mom. A great time was had by all. We got there about 10:30, right when the park opened. Rob decided to hit the roller coasters in gotten City first(Superman and The Joker). He had to go by himself because the rest of us aren't big roller coaster fans. Meanwhile, my mom watched the baby and JennyandI went on the AlpineBobs. What an awesome ride.It goes forwards and backwards. When it started going backwards, we're like "This isn't so bad." and then the ride started picking up speed. Suddenly we're like "Tell us when it's over.":) After that,we rode the Blizzard River ride, which is basically a tube down a long water slide. You don't get very wet but like most water slides, it's lots of fun. Then for the baby we went to Looney Toons land, or whateverit's called. We rode the carousel because Shaylee was too short for all the other rides. Oh, well, there's always next year when she's 2. Rob said they would bring her back for her 36" anniversary. We then decided to take a break for lunch. After that, water rides. We hit the wave pool with Shaylee. She had a great time trying to bend down and drink the water. When the wave pool closed for a 15 minute break, we went over the Kiddie's Cove so Shay could play in the water with people her own height :) Jen put her down in the water, Shay lost her balance, and fell face first into the water, but no tears. She was okay. After Kiddie's Cove, we went on the Lazy River. What a good way to get some sun. You can lie there and think about getting tan. After Lazy River, Rob decided to hit the wave pool while the rest of us dried off by lying in the sun. Shay took a little nap and when Rob came back, he , Jenny ,and I decided to go to the waterslides. We went on the colored ones(red and blue). Those slides have been there since the park was called Wild World. We went down those about four times and went back to the chairs where Shay had woken up. Jenny took Shay into the pool with her and then her and Rob went down a couple more waterslides. It was almost time for me to go so Jenny and I went on the tilt-a-whirl. Then unfortunately, I had to leave to go to rehearsal. We had a final blocking rehearsal last night. Originally, I was supposed to stay at Six Flags a lot later but then I won tickets to a concert at the 9:30 Club. Then I was reminded about rehearsal, which I needed to be at, so I had to find someone to give my tickets to. Luckily, Ro helped me out and found someone. I was looking forward to going to that concert too. Ah, well. What are you going to do? Anyway, my day at Six Flags yesterday was a lot of fun. If I could go every day,I would. Look for pictures I post from my fun day. More later......
I just my knee on the stupid computer desk. Cuckoo's rehearsal tonight. Best rehearsal ever. It was hilarious. Brush-ups can be. Someone made a comment about Tim not being suicidal enough in his portrayal as Billy Bibbit, so tonight we made him a sign to wear that said "I'm suicidal." Anyway, fun, fun. We went to Oliver's afterwards. Steve B. (a friend of mine) came with us since he's going to be filling in on Sunday for someone. I love Steve and we've been friends for years but I always feel like he might be hitting on me. He's nice but I don't think so. Maybe 2 years ago or even a year ago but not now. Tomorrow night we have Stage Door rehearsal and the people from MPT are supposed to be coming to tape. We'll see what happens there. On another note, I'm going to Six Flags tomorrow. Hooray. More later......
My best friend keeps telling me that I need to "get some action" as he so lovingly puts it. Any takers? :) Seriously........anyone willing to play Parchessi(as we call it) with me? I'm not the champ but I'm not a beginner either ;0) Okay....What an odd message. Aw, whatever....... More later......
Now that I have your attention :) What a long fricking weekend. Performances Friday and Saturday and Sunday afternoon. Rehearsal Saturday afternoon. Auditions Sunday evening. It's crazy, right? Well, yeah, but what fun!!!! I'm only on stage for a short amount of time as are two other female roles. The three of us will just sit and talk outside while we're waiting to go on. It was especially great this weekend since Kathryn was filling in for Diana. Mary and I were so glad it was Kathryn, who is loads of fun!!!!! Saturday after the show, we went to Rocky Run with some people from the Ride the Winds cast, who had come and seen the show. It was Steve's birthday and the restaurant staff sang "Happy Birthday". Nik, somehow, knocked over and broke a bottle of hot sauce. Ro was making friends with people at the next table, who had come from the Kenny Chesney concert. It was great. I haven't had such a good time in weeks....But I wake up Sunday morning to discover that I am developing a cold. So through Sunday's performance, I'm sniffling and I'm also overly warm on stage. Then we all go and eat at C.J. Ferrari's, an Italian restaurant,which makes one of the best steak sandwiches in the tri-county area. It was nice to sit down and talk to Robin, who plays Scanlon. He lives in Germantown so he doesn't usually come out with us. He was sticking around to audition, so we dragged him along. Auditions went very well. I think Kathe (the director) wasn't expecting so many guys. There are more auditions tonight so we'll see how she decides to cast the show. If not cast, I'm going to stage manage. I was asked to do "An Amercian Daughter" at GAC but have decided to not. I love working at Greenbelt but I'm just not sure about the show. I've also been asked to audition at PGLT for "Lady Wyndemre's Fan" which opens in October. I might and then go into "Our Town". Yes, I'm keeping busy but I know where my priorites(sp?) lie. Work, family and any relationships I might have in the near future always come first, before theatre. We were just finishing rehearsal last night and we were turning the lights off. Ro left the stage lights on and then turned to me and said "Isn't it beautiful? The stage. She's always faithful. Sometimes cruel but always faithful." Spoken like a true theatre person, Rory!!!!!! :) Well, blah, blah, blah. Yadda, yadda, yadda. More later.......
I'm so sick of liars and assholes. Quite simply, men. I don't mean to offend since I know women do the same things that guys do but why do guys say one thing and then turn around and do the complete opposite of what they've said. It makes me sick. Maybe I should take my mom's advice and become a nun. Arrgh!!! There are some things I thought I could deal with but I'm wrong. I know everything happens for a reason but why does alot of the bad stuff happen to me? :)On a different note, my ex-shag buddy(or as he has been called by some people : Tool) is coming to see the show next weekend. Whoop-de-do.I used to have this big thing for him. I'm so glad those feelings are gone. He could be a prick sometimes....More later.......
Hey. I made a incredibly retarded film. Check it out. http://mm.dfilm.com/mm2s/mm_route.php?id=1881972
"It's time to take out the trash -- dump whomever needs dumping, clear out your emotional baggage and get ready for new love coming your way." This is what my horoscope said today. I'm going to ignore the whole love thing but I take everything else to be a sign. I'm going to clear all my emotional baggage away. Be gone, big suitcases of woe!!!! Shove off, duffel bag of despair!!! God, I'm such a goober :) Anyway, rehearsal tonight for Stage Door. Good as it usually is. We're blocking the rest of Act 2 on Wednesday. We're getting closer to the end of the blocking. Yes!!!!! Now, I can finally begin to watch what the actors are doing with their facial expressions and body language. After rehearsal, Ro and I watched Road Rules Xtreme while going over the bios and character studys our actors turned in. Road Rules was kind of ho-hum. The character studys, however, were very interesting. Some of these kids can really write. Speaking of which, a dear friend of mine told me that they read my blog and gave me some advice. "Don't let your life go to shit. You are extremely talented." Well, duh, the talented part I know :) Just joking :) But I know that they're right. I graduated high school 6 years ago and I haven't really done anything with my life since then., Except join up in community theatre. Hopefully, when I get some money, I can get some schooling done. I'm going to apply to Simmons College in Boston for the 2005-2006 semester. They have a great liberal arts program there and since I want to be a teacher, that's a good program to get into. More later......
HAPPY JULY 4TH!!!!! Normally, I'm not all that big on July 4th. This year, however, was my niece's first 4th with fireworks. Last year, she had been born but my sister wasn't real big on bringing a 3 week old baby to a fireworks display. This year, we hit Fort Meade for some good family fun. We hung out for a bit at the carnival they have at MeadeFest, I freaked when I thought I saw an ex of mine, calmed down when I realized it was only a remarkable double (just missing the glasses).Then we settled back to watch the fireworks with some drunks near us adding the usual ohhhs and ahhs. And of course, every year, I have to sit near someone who starts singing(badly, I might add) "Proud to be An American". It's usually a drunk doing the singing. On the drunk note, I just want to say that all my friends who drink,(whether it be legally or not ;) I just hope you all got home safely. Some of you I know were okay, others I worry about alot(you know who you are). My niece, Shaylee, had a blast at the fireworks. She sat very nicely for all 25 minutes of the fireworks. Then I sat in traffic for a half an hour with Michelle, waiting to get off the base. But it's okay. We sang along with Hoobastank the whole way home :) HAPPY 4TH!!!!!
I'm feeling sooo wonderful. I had a long talk with one of my closest friends tonight. We talked about all sorts of things that have been going on and we rehashed some old memories. She made me remember things that were kind of painful but also special. I'm glad to have found someone to sit down and listen to me blab on for 20 minutes at a time :) Thanks Mickey!!!!!!
We had another great performance tonight. After I did my scenes in the first act, I went and sat on the roof and looked at the stars. It's my new calming technique. Not that I really needed any calming :) It was just so beautiful outside. I just wish I had someone to sit with me on the roof. I love my friends but I have no one fun to talk to. I enjoy talking with my friends but I miss talking with a great sense of humor. My friends always talk about the same things. I miss the good talks I used to have with .... Oops, forgot that I'm trying not to mention old hurts anymore. Trying to keep myself sane :) Ha!!!!!!! Cuckoo's Nest is fun. Not as much fun as it was in the beginning but still fun!!!!! We're missing an actor all next weekend and then we're missing an actor for our second matinee. We have a replacement for next weekend. We're trying to find a replacement for the 18th. It's a small guy part. If anyone knows of somebody, let me know. Thanks!!!!! I'm supposed to go with Eric to the movies tomorrow, or rather, today. Don't know if I will. Not the brightest idea right now. I'm worried that I'm too suspectible to anything right now and that I might do something I shouldn't with him, when there's only one person I want to do that sort of thing with and, no it's not Ro!!!!! Never in a million years!!!!! He's my brother for god sakes. More later..... I hope you checked out my pictures from after the concert the other night!!!!!!
urlLink All together say "We love Ben Folds!!!" No bunny ears this time. urlLink
urlLink Hey. No smoking in the elevator, Ro!!!! urlLink
urlLink "I hope you're not giving me bunny ears" is exactly what I'm thinking. urlLink
Went to the Pier 6 Pavilion with Rory on Wednesday and saw Rufus Wainwright, Ben Folds, and Guster. It was a great show. Very well done!!!!! Ben Folds, you are still the piano god. Guster was excellent. I saw them open for BNL a couple of years ago. I have a couple of their CDs. They went on last after Ben, so by then, I was all yelled out :) Ben rocked as he always does. He did many amazing songs from his new EP, which will be very welcome by yours truly :) Rufus Wainwright has a beautful voice and I'm going to see again as soon as I can. All in all, the concert was great. More later!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have nothing to report. Boring, boring, boring!!!! Oh, well, my 'rents are headed up to Boston tomorrow evening for a week. Some alone time. Hooray!!! Not like I see my parents every minute of every day but you know, I love having the house to myself. Ahhh. Now I can walk around naked : ) Tomorrow starts another fun weekend of performances. I hope they go as well as last week's. More later........
Wow!! The BNL concert was awesome on Tuesday. I met lots of people I've only talked to online before and I had a great time. Got to Merriweather about 6:15. Parked at the mall and then went to MP to meet up with Katie. She informs me that the seats we got aren't that great. I said it was fine. I'm not picky. Anything is better than the lawn, though lawn seats have their moments : ) We walk around for a bit and then find our seats. The opening act is some guy named Mark McAdam. He was pretty decent. No Gavin DeGraw, but still fairly good. After he was done, we waited a good 40 minutes for Alanis to come on. I was worried her set would run into the Ladies' set but she finished when she was supposed to after a rocking encore with BNL. Having never seen Alanis in concert before, I didn't know what to expect. I thought she might suck but she was great. Not much acknowledgement of the audience but some artists are like that. The guys came out during her last song and started rocking out and then they all started grinding with the guitarist. Funniest thing all night. After 20 minutes for set up, it was BNL's turn. They opened with Brian Wilson. Some Fantastic next and then banter and a rap about the eye makeup Steve was wearing. The reason I love BNL is the banter they have between themselves and how they manage to include every single person in the audience into their talks. They're just awesome. They played for about an hour and 20 minutes, closing with Shopping, which is a great song that features choreography with shopping carts. Yes, shopping carts. They left the stage. Came back on for an encore of Break Your Heart(beautiful song) and It's All Been Done. Left the stage again. Came back for a second encore with Too Little, Too Late. They usually only do two encores, so after that the concert was officially over. Katie and I decided to go and try to meet the band back by the buses. While we were contemplating this, a guy walks up to me and starts talking to me about the band and how he can't believe he's meeting me. I have no idea who this guy is. Turns out he's from barenaked.net, which is a fan board I belong to. I've talked to him a couple times and he turns out to be very sweet and kind of cute. He talks to us for another minute, then goes back to his friends. Katie, myself, and several others wait outside the back gates for an hour before being told that the band won't be coming out because it's a crew member's birthday. Having met the band, I wasn't too disappointed. I had a good time hanging with all the other crazy BNL fans. We walked back to our cars, Katie dropped me off at mine, I came home and dropped. My legs still hurt. I could barely stand up at rehearsal tonight : ) I was dancing all over the place at the concert. That's what concerts are for!!!!! Anyway, I had a marvelous time and can't wait for my next BNL concert. This weekend is looking to be pretty boring. My 'rents are going on vacation starting Friday and I'll have the house to myself. Snooze-fest!!! I'm going to be so bored. Thank goodness for the show!!!!! More later.......
is what the concert was !!!! Alanis was supposed to close but the Ladies did instead. It was amazing as always. I just got back and I'm exhausted from standing so much and screaming. I'll post more tomorrow before Stage Door rehearsal. My new friend, Katie, and I were talking about Green Day and how we can't wait to see them this fall. Anyone want to come with us? It's going to be a rocking time. More later......
I changed the way my blog looks. I hope it doesn't confuse people. I don't want anyone to think "Oh, this isn't it." and leave. I'm very excited. I'm seeing Barenaked Ladies tomorrow. i haven't seen them since Februray. I'm sure they'll be great. Tomorrow would have been concert day anyway. If not BNL, I would have headed down to Virginia and the Project Revolution Tour with Korn, Snoop Dogg, and many more. I'm going to see BNL with a new friend tomorrow, Katie. We met through the fanclub. She has an extra fanclub seat and asked if there were any takers. I took it. It's going to be a little weird. I usually go to BNL concerts with my friends. Katie is a HUGE BNL fan so I'm sure we'll get along very well. I have to hit the shower and then I have Dining Room rehearsal at 7:30 at the theatre. More later.......
Matinee today. Very good. We did nothing afterwards, so I am now sitting at home bored out of my mind!!!!! What to do?!?! I could play Parchessi but, alas, I have no partner!!!!! The answers to my two other questions: Where am I ticklish? Def. the sides and I'm been told I'm ticklish behind the knees and on my neck. I don't agree fully with that. First celebrity/sprots figure I had a crush on? Scott Stevens. He played for the Washington Capitals years ago and he is the reason I love th NJ Devils. He is the most awesome hockey player in the world!!!!!! More later.......
Real quick. Show went very well. No one called me any names. We all had a great time at Bennigan's. I love these kids!!!!!! My parents are flying up to Boston this morning and will be back Monday night. Party!!!! No, I'm kidding. My great aunt passed away Thursday night. She was a great woman. She will be sorely missed. My parents are flying up there today, but then driving up there on Friday for vacation and to stay a week. Too bad they couldn't figure out some way to stay. It would make it easier, I think. Okay. That made no sense :) Matinee tomorrow afternoon and then possibly supper with the cast of crazies we have. Someone call me if you want to hang with my lonesome self!!!!!!! More later.......
Well, tonight went great!!!! We had a sold out house, the audience loved it, and the cast was awesome!!!!! It would have been great except that somebody(not a cast member!!!) called me a bitch. I've actually never been called one to my face, especially not by someone who is a good 25 years older than me. Very mature!!!! I was confused because I wasn't sure that he really said it and then he said" That's what you are.". It's all this theatre crap again!! The person in question is on the other side, majorly. I wasn't mad until I realized that he actually said that to me. I then got really pissed because I've never been anything but nice to that family. I know that that's the way of the world. To add to all the crap, we went to Friday's afterwards and everyone(practically!!) was coupled up. I hate when that happens. I've come to the conclusion that I'm not meant to be relationship material for anybody. My friends are always telling me "You're so sweet, pretty, and funny. You'll meet that right someone." I'm at that point in life where I feel like I might have already met that person and I let them slip away. Do you ever get that feeling? I also feel like I'm never going to play "Parchessi" again!!! I had an offer but I guess he chickened out. Aw well!You know where I am.Come and get me : p Blah, blah, blah. I'm tired and confused!!!!! Goodnight, Montreal!!!!!! BNL in 4 days!!!!!! Hooray!!!! More later.......
I've decided that since I'm so bad of thinking of titles for my posts, that I would just use Barenaked Ladies song titles. Creative, eh? It means I won't run out of titles for a good 3 to 4 weeks : ) On to the post. We are in Hell Week for Stage Door. Everything is looking great except for the middle of Act 3, Scene 1. Hopefully, we can get it running right by Friday. I've also discovered last night that I have to do the whole program myself since my print program won't allow me to send it to the person who was going to put the bios and graphics together. Mo's going to be upset but oh well. There's nothing I can do about it. Tonight Ro informed me that Dining Room was going to be rehearsing upstairs so we needed all the kids to stay in the back yard. Ordinarily, I wouldn't have a problem with this except when we started the show tonight, it was a good 85 degrees outside and these kids are wearing suits and long dresses. I also was informed from a couple of parents that someone from DR was very rude when one or two of the kids were trying to get their shoes or costumes from the side where they were rehearsing. I have a good idea of who it was. I told Ro that they cannot rehearse up there on Thursday. I am planning to run it like a real performance and we wouldn't be running a rehearsal during a performance. I respect their right to rehearse but we were not informed ahead of time that they would be rehearsing up there. Also, our kids need to get changed and several other things too. I'm going to really miss Stage Door rehearsal. It's been keeping me upbeat and happy. I haven't been in a good mood like this since hell week for Ride the Winds. That was one of the best weeks of my life. I just had fun working lights and stage managing that show. I was in much happier place then, lifewise. Cuckoo's Nest hell week was blah. Never looked forward to it at all. I won't have anything to do now. Not many Dining Room rehearsals I have to attend since I could stage manage in my sleep. I'll have to ponder over what to do while I'm working on the program all night!!!! Oh, answers to questions. 1st show I ever directed? You Can't Take It With You.1st show I was ever in? Little Women, I played Meg. My car is dark blue. I can't remember the other question, if there was another question : ) More later........ Please come and visit if you're in the area this week. My job is basically done!!!!
In thinking about the Eric situation, I know that I would definitely not date him. He's great and all but there are only about 3 guys I would want to date right about now. No fair guessing who!!! More later....... HAPPY BIRTHDAY DADDO!!!!!
I was awoken at 3am because, stupid me, I didn't put my phone in silent mode as I normally do. I looked at the display and saw that it was my "buddy" Eric. I was half asleep and didn't feel like talking since we usually talk for about 2 or 3 hours, so I didn't answer. I love Eric(or Eazy E, as he's sometimes called). He's been there for me when I've been dealing with some bad stuff. He was there after my last relationship and he felt bad for me. He told me that he thought it might be something really special since I seemed to really like this guy. Then he asked me if I wanted him to kick his butt. I said "No!!". Eric is someone I sometimes consider dating. He's a good listener, funny, and cute. He can be very goofy!! We talked on the phone a couple of months ago on the night Ride the Winds closed. I remember because I was in a funky mood. He asked me if I would ever date him. I said"I guess." "So, that's a yes?" "It's an I guess!" I'm really not in the mood to get hurt for a 3rd time this year. And I think Eric would hurt me. This is someone I almost dated 3 years ago but didn't for good reasons. I don't know. Eric is a unsolvable mystery, much like another guy I know. You think you have figured what they might do and then they turn around and do the complete opposite. Yes, I know a lot of people are like that. That's life. I'm exhausted so here's a weird fact. Thinking about Eric reminded me of this fact. Guys that wear glasses, I find really sexy. It's not because I wear them. It's usually guys that wear the glasses for reading or driving. I don't why but it's really sexy when they wear those glasses. This is the case with a lot of guys I've been attracted to in the past. Eric, Steve, others.... Call me crazy and get it over with : ) I just love it : ) More later......
That's me : p No, really. I had a nice weekend, albeit a little crazy. Friday I went with Rory to see my friend Rameen in Ragtime. I've already posted about that. Saturday, set construction for Stage Door and a little rehearsal. We've gotten Act 3 , Scene 1 down to 23 minutes which is decent. Hopefully it'll be less than that tomorrow night. I stayed at the theatre until about 3:15 on Saturday. Then I went to my Daddo's 50th birthday party. We had it at my cousin's house. It was great. She has a pool and it was such a beautiful day. Lots of theatre folks were there and everyone had a great time. Ro and I then went back to the theatre to help put in the steps. Well, since neither of us are very good carpenters, we ended up writing Ro's bio and the directors' notes, finally!!!! The directors' notes are very good. A little sappy but we feel very strongly about this show and the young actors involved. Anyway, then I drove Ro home and we watched Road Rules and waited for Kathe to come home. When she got there, we read her Ro's bio which she thought was very high and mighty even for him : ) I went home and fell asleep late. Then this morning I had to get up and try to get to the theatre on time. Of course, I didn't get there until about 12:30. There was lots of stuff to do, though. Finish painting the floor, clean the risers off, put another rack for costumes upstairs, put a railing on the steps onstage. Much, much stuff. And it all got done. At 7pm, we had a Q 2 Q and it was long. We got out of there about 10:15 or maybe even after that. I was so exhausted that I came straight home. Did I go to sleep? No, of course not. I have to finish the program and send it to the woman who is printing our programs. I better check my bio. I might be sending an old one. I hope that I'm with it enough to make sure I send the right one :) Rehearsal every night this week and we open on Friday!!!!! Oh my goodness. Are we ready? I sure as hell hope so. More later........
We got a new puppy. She's adorable, of course, but she has no name. I started my training at Outback. It is fine. So far none of my 2 trainers have made very much money so it makes me wonder. I might as well try and find another job during the day so that I don't end up living at home forever. Or I could just play with the pup or lay out by the pool until it's time to go into work everyday. Tomorrow I'm gonna go eat at Thai place, the best restaurant in Kansas city. Yum. It's so fattening and great. The guy who trained me at work tonight is moving away so I will probably never see him again. I'm not sad about it at all. Sometimes I feel weird whenever I drive by cars or somethin and see the people doing their thing and realize that there is probably no chance I will ever see them again in my lifetime. You'd think it would make me want to get to know people better. Hmm. It doesn't, though. The other day I must have dislocated my jaw temporarily because it hurt to chew or brush my teeth (but I still did both anyway). It's okay today. I've eaten pizza the past three days in a row. I am on the all carb diet. Oh, except for I drink Diet Sprite, just to save on the calories and all. I need to go to the gym but instead I'm going out to eat for lunch tomorrow. My priorities are not really in line. One day I will work out every day and eat healthy all the time. I'll probably die that next week. I truly believe that I am going to live to be 103, though. When they ask me "what's your secret?", I will tell them that I ate as many carbs as possible and that I watched infomercials about workout equipment from the comfort of my recliner. Hopefully I will get at least a mention on the 10 o'clock news. I would go on but I really feel like I can't write much now that I've been talking about the last birthday of my life. I'll start new next time.
I start working Saturday. I need to make a resume so that I can get a real job, though. My dog must have rolled around in something bad outside because she smells really bad. I don't even wanna touch her. I need to mow the yard tomorrow. I like listening to my mp3 player while I mow the yard. My mom and sister come home from Las Vegas tomorrow. That would be nice if they brought me back some cash. My sister got her picture taken with Tommy Lee in the Las Vegas airport. I've never met anyone famous before. Unless you count Jason Mraz. I have a picture with him. He's skinny. When he signed the poster I got of him, I made him draw a mustache on himself. I gave it to my friend because she's in love with him. That was my brush with fame. I would like to be famous. I would like it if people wanted to know my business. I need a job. Good thing my dog left me alone because she stinks and she needs a bath. I should become a professional dog bather. I might get bitten but it's all in a day's work, I guess. I need to find my calling one of these days. I'm off to look for it. Goodbye.
I need a job. I have 2 five-dollar bills in my purse, negativefiftyfourdollars in my checking account, and only half a tank of gas left in my car. Going to spain for a semester was actually a good idea for someone who doesn't mind going into a little debt. "It's okay, I'll come back and work at Hereford House whenever I come home", I told myself back in January when I had over $2,000 in my bank and no bills to pay off. So I've been back for practically a month now and I'm finally forcing myself to find any other place that will hire me since my old job apparently has no room left for me to work there. They're missing out. Oh well. Bigger and Better. hmm. Too bad the only 'Bigger and Better' in my future is the Outback Steakhouse. Crikey! My life is great. I really need a job, though.
Writing in my blog reminds me of going to the gym. I don't have to make excuses though. In the long run, I'm the one who will suffer. Nobody else. I'm the one who will be out of shape and void of any useless memories as the ones I might write about today. That's okay though. I'm sure I will forget about this blog one day altogether in the same way that I will forget about going to the gym ever again. When I'm stuck with a day that's gray and lonely, I just stick out my chin and grin and say. The sun will come out tomorrow. Come what may. Musicals hold the answers to many of my questions. Or maybe I should say musicals hold the answers to too many of my questions. If I only had a brain. Right now I have two dogs trying to convince me it's time to go to bed. The two pound puppy was fine laying on me but now that the eleven-pounder is up here too, it's a bit much. No offense, Bella, but maybe you should consider taking up a yoga class or something. I joke, I joke. I love my mutant chihuahua. Speaking of yoga though.. I should probably start off my week with a trip to the gym tomorrow. Or I could stay home and write in my blog some more. Somewhere out there, skies are blue, and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true. Sweet dreams.
i actually have a blog? haha well we'll see how long i keep up with this..............
the word ‘love’ is said too often too easily too much too cheaply taken for granted used to achieve some other intentions to express other vague emotions not understood why?
life's taken an unexpected turn, i'm happy as it is right now.......... Talked to an old friend whom btw i've never met before (how bizarre *grinz*) all these yrs we never clicked as much as we did ytd, would not happen if we tried earlier. 'all in it's time' is probably my slogan for now i must keep reminding myself that. I swear God has this sense of humour. I feel right now as if He's taking me for a drive. Although, He keeps me up with His 'jokes'. You probably wouldn't understand what I'm talking about, might as well hahhahaa.... all I asked for in one guy He manage to spread in quite a few, characteristics coming from totally unexpected direction. My life's becoming one big korean drama *laugh*. In search for love itself He had shown me a lot. No matter how much I grumble I do realise that this grace time is much needed and I will eventually get there and find the 'one' or one of the 'ones', someone said to me one that she believes there are more than one the 'one'. maybe it's true... whatever it is I'll be here waiting, I'll try to be patient though it's hard sometime.....
I want to be free of this ridiculous worldly affair............ but how? how do i undo all damage done? how do i erase mammories, get rid of worldly needs? be content with myself as it is? i should be, i try to be. sometime i manage to but at other times i can't. i'd get disturbed by the most ridiculous trivial things. things that shouldn't bother me anymore. why am i so sensitive? why do i think too much? i have other things, bigger things in life that i lose focus of from time to time, why??
urlLink just moi urlLink
I'm tired.......... I just wanna go home..................
and hide from everything. that's what i feel like doing right now. *stress*
i've fallen out................. it was just a matter of time. as expected.
i was standing over my baked pasta earlier...... if only i have ppl to share it with....... tough thing being away from home, from your family.... in context of mother's day. mothers are the most selfless ppl. they give and give and give..... even without realising it themselves or realised by others sadly. and yet.... how many of us, at one stage in our life was ashame of our mothers? mom come on let go of my hand! what if my friends see....... then ou grow up and THEN sometimeyou wish your mom could hold your hand but she's not there. mom gells a family together. at least i think so even if you don't. not saying dads aren't important. dad's the back bone of a family but moms gell everyone together. i want to be a mom too.... one day...... if given the opportunity. it is a blessing to become a mom as much as a mom is a blessing to her family...... or at least i think so :O)
For those of you out there who are in love and lucky enough to have each other, do realise how blessed you are........ please do not take the fact that you are with your love for granted. not everyone's that lucky.................
picnic was......... oh i can't describe it in one word..... ok imagine...... green grass.... cool air, warm sun........ on a hill under lots of big ancient trees, the river in the distant...... jazz in the air (brought my boom box along hehe)...... pancakes, ice cream.... laughters...... more laughters...... and even more laughters.... especially when this guy patrick started throwing spoonfulls of fresh cream with closed eyes (the i dea is it hits whoever it hits hahahhaa) but somehow the biggest dollops ALWAYS landed on lizzy....... or when lizzy, pat and lindsay tried posing for a cool pose photo, a soccer ball hit lindsay at the back of her head!! hahahahaaaa was the funniest moment!! oh photos! took them with my semi auto non digi though so gotta wait for me to finish the film and develop :O) perth..... could be a great place...... with the right company *smilez*...... i will miss all this one day if i move away. Sometimes such times feel like gems you found on the road as you walk along the road of your life, to be collected and kept carefully in that little treasure box in your chest and you want to hold on to them with your dear life coz you can lose everything in life but no one can steal memories........ that's why i think when i get old rather than getting alzheimer and lose my little gems or forget ppl that i love even! i'd rather die..... *smilez* well..... that's my sunday so far..... been sitting on my desk otherwise trying to get some work done. it's beautiful outside. 25 degree.... all blue skies and breeze. perth is btw one windy city. the air is hardly ever still. i'm lucky to always be near the river. the swan river. live on the shore of it, drive along it, walk along it.... see it, breath it every day. just one of those days. when i'm just thankful for what i have :O) one gem of a day............
I'm sick and tired of always feeling sick and tired!! to quote anastacia's new song how appropriate........ *groan*
The house is full of loud noise, people doing several things at once and here I sit with a set of earphones and my portable cd player. The music is "Celtic Devotion" by Oliver Schroer. It is good to hear so much noise in this house again. All three of my children under one roof for the moment. I smile. I am blessed beyond words. Soon enough the house will be quiet again. One son will drive off tomorrow back to his home in Quincy, Calif. The kid brother and my youngest will take themselves off to do what needs doing so their work week will start off right or be relaxing with a video game. The hubby will be snoozing in his chair and I will be puttering around doing household chores, seeing to email or hopefully writing. My daughter will be cleaning house after her two whirlwinds aka children. For the moment, this moment, I bask in the noise that is beyond the office where this computer sits. I did a good job. I brought up three wonderful children, gave them a sense of belonging and of right and wrong. I gave my kid brother the support and love he so much needed when the bottom of his world fell out one night 16 years ago and I had to come home and tell a 16 year old boy his mother was not coming home ever again. All our lives changed that night, certainly not for the better, but we're all stronger and those of us who aren't... I hope that by now they have found themselves. The night is clear and warm, the stars are bright, the music is soft in my ears and I could dance under the heavens..perhaps I will before I turn to my slumber and my dreams... On this eve of Beltane I wish you all Hope, Renewal and Promise... May music dance through your soul... May Laughter and Love be the shining star the guides you Through this sometimes weary world.... Blessed Be... And My Honored Knight... Come dance with me...
The Day has slipped through my fingers like water. I got an early enough start on work. My mother-in-law called to see how we were. We talked for ages. I then called another couple we are rather fond of to check on them. They just got home from a visit to England. Oh yes, let me not forget to mention the usual various calls from my daughter who seems to think she must call me every single time the status of their apartment hunting changes. By the time I glanced at the clock in the livingroom I figured I had a few moments to myself before my hair appointment. I sauntered into the office and sat down at my desk, glanced at the monitor, swore, dashed out, scooped up my purse as I went and beat it down the dirt road to hopefully make it to the hair dresser's. I did and for once she wasn't running behind schedule. Let me pause here a minute and backtrack. I have come to the conclusion, one, I not only live in a zoo, but two, I live in the twilight zone. There is not one clock in this house that runs on the exact same time, right down to the cellphones, all 3 of them. You can go from room to room, from vcr to vcr and you won't find the same time anywhere. By the way, I have one in the masterbath that's stuck on 12:30. I think a new battery is in order. I'll put it on the " Honey Do " list. There is a reason for each of these clocks being at the time they are on... I won't list them, trust me, let me spare your conscious mind. Besides, I don't want you to get sucked into this twilight zone... it's almost like a weasel getting sucked into a jet engine. Would you believe I have been after the hubby to change the clock in the office. By the time he got around to it, Daylight Savings Time had rolled around again. I don't wear a watch, despise them. I will consent to wear one if I have to be on a time schedule with appointments pending. At the moment, I find myself with a few moments to jot down this blog while getting into Yahoo Groups to authorize a message or two for posting to Camelot's email list. I may even drop a line or two in myself. Then it's off to that movie I've missed out on so far. Nope, we didn't go last night. I was just too tired and my stomach was killing me, nerves is my guess. Tums are a wonder drug. So, third time is the charm, right GQS? ~grin~ The movie is Mel Gibson's latest, " Passion of the Christ ". My hubby is Catholic so he is curious, as I am. I am not Catholic however, I am Wiccan. My spiritual take has always been, 'all roads lead to the Divine'. I am more curious from a writer's viewpoint to see what has everyone talking so. I am also curious as to the graphic content I am hearing so much about. Late dinner afterward. I get my grandbabies tomorrow, so my day is accounted for. My granddaughter is 7 and my grandson is 3. When we went to Vegas, I bought my grandson a broad sword and shield. I also bought a set for the granddaughter out of self defense. We'll see how it turns out tomorrow. The toys, needless to say, are going home with them. On Saturday I am off to the Renaissance Celtic Faire for the day. The weather is suppose to be grand as well. Another full day of knights and ladies, jousts, plays and good food. I am looking forward to it. Maybe I'll find that elusive Muse!! Intertwined in all this is work and more work. My cup runneth over and is flooding the floor. I just hope I don't slip in it.... Oh! And my granddaughter and South Park is another blog for another day... ~eye roll~
It's been one of those days. Today should have been a Monday. Everybody's calling, wanting a piece of me. There's work on my desk that's a small molehill. My contractors are demanding, my vendors are whining and I want off the friggin' merry-go-round, thankyouverymuch. Yesterday my husband and my youngest son got into it and I shouldn't be surprised, they were due. it's like clock work, about every six months. In turn, my hubby decided to snap at me as well. Surprisingly, I didn't blow my own headbolt. I don't mind the arguments, I just don't care for the sarcasm. I don't need it. Call it a shut down for my own survival. I let him rant and cuss and stomp off. He took himself off to the back forty to mow the long grass, might as well be constructive in his temper tantrum, hm? The youngest got into his car and went driving. He's not stupid, I'm not worried. He just needed to get out and away before he did or said something disrespectful. Needless to say the young man came home, the hubby came into the house, they made it good. I got after the youngest, nicely...isn't he lucky? The hubby apologised for getting angry and messing up our dinner and movie date for the evening with a promise we'll do it tonight. Right now, I don't care. I'm numb. I haven't a creative bone in my body. I'm plugged into my cd player and listening to Martina McBride's Greatest Hits. I need something.... I just don't know what. On another front, I just read GQS', my twin-soul-sister, latest blog entry. She made me smile. I'm glad it worked out. She found validation and it will all work out for the best. I could have told her that...wait.. ~grin~ I think I did. All in all, my life is good. Sometimes, I feel like something is missing.. I could list what I think that is.. what I know it is.. what will it serve? We can't have everything our little ole hearts desire, not without a price and at this point in my life, the price for that bit of self satisfaction is not worth the rest of my life. Right now, I'd just settle for a bit of inspiration for my various muses...what I can't have in reality, I can find satisfaction in and through my imagination... I need to find some time for roleplay in channel. I have a commitment there. It's just that I fall asleep so early lately and get up even earlier or my sleep is broken up with this or that. Something is making me restless and I need to deal with it. In other words, I need to get a grip, but how do you get a grip when your handle on life just broke? ~grin~
Personally, I don't think I am the stereotype mother-in-law, then again, that's my opinion. I have only one son-in-law and thank the heavens it's enough. Basically, he's a good person. I call him Fertilizer Boy and shall hence forth be referred to as " FB". Why do I call him FB you might ask. I'll tell you. Since my daughter married him, there are times I have wanted to bury him in my rose bushes and use him for fertilizer. My mantra where he is concerned seems to be, " He's young. He'll grow up. We're all a product of our enviroment. There's still a chance". Of course, there is the fact that my daughter has to sleep with him (Gee, I sound like my mother about now) and I don't. She set her sights on him from high school. Several years and one daughter later, she married him. Like I said, he's a good person. He loves my granddaughter as if she was his own flesh and blood. He does look after the kids, my daughter has CFS and a host of other illnesses. In her own words, she's a poster child for medical problems. She's trying to learn to live with it, he's trying to live with it and I'm trying to stay out of it. Now and then though, I want to go "POW" straight to the moon. Oh, let me add here, my daughter is not blameless in all this and she does get an earful from me when I do need to say something. Example: They live from check to check and scrape by. He went back to school on the GI bill and on his VA disability. Sometime over Thanksgiving, his brother (the one home from Iraq) gave him $1,000.00 to spend on himself. We don't know what the exact conversation was that took place between the brothers, but it ended up with FB getting a check for $1000.00. He didn't mention it to my daughter. She found the check when his wallet fell out of his pants and came open. Long story short, he bought himself a laptop AND borrowed an extra $300.00 from a friend to get it. The friend is suppose to get his money back via some rebates FB has coming to him. FB has wanted this laptop, he didn't really need it. Who needs a laptop really when you come right down to it? My daughter wanted him to have one but told him it had to wait until they could afford it. So much for that. Oh, did I mention that after she found out about the check, FB told her she couldn't tell me about it or his dad? Why? Because if they got into a financial emergency, I wouldn't help them out if I knew about it. Damn skippy. At least he kinda knows me. Needless to say, my daughter advised FB that if and when my granddaughter's sperm donor ever coughed up child support, he wasn't seeing any of it, period...well at least a $1000.00 of it. She recently got some money from the county in relation to collections. True to her word, he didn't see any of it. He isn't happy. He also isn't happy that she didn't tell him when she got the checks. She reminded him that he didn't tell her about his check. Stalemate. Example 2: When they lived here with us, he was a slob. They had to move out. They moved in with his parents. She was deemed the slob and could do no right. They got into fight one night and his father got in her face and yelled at her to shut up. FB let him. Then FB took their son and locked themselves into his parents room and wouldn't let her take their son with her when she came over to my house for the next night or two. When I came for her, his father made it abundantly clear that she wasn't taking the boy anywhere. It was a good thing I was on his property. His mother proceeded to tell me what an awful slob my daughter was and how my daughter spent money like it was water and was ruining her son financially. Not exacftly those words, but it meant the same thing. Needless to say, I told her what I experienced with their son and then we left, minus the baby, called the sheriff dept and found out her options. Like always, they worked things out, especially when he figured out that he was not going to get custody of his son. They always manage to work it out. Example 3: FB is flunking a couple of hard college classes. Who's fault is it? His wife's. She always has him doing things. Well yeah. However in her defense, she tells him over and over to let her know that he has homework and she will make sure he has the time alone to get it done. Recently she found out that he could be doing extra credit to help pass. He's known it for awhile now. He hasn't done it yet. Why? Her fault. She has him doing things. He's known for many days, if not weeks now. No excuse. He rather play on the Playstation. He can be an irritating little chit in a friendly sort of way. He buys me gnomes for my garden. I think gnomes are cliche. I accept them in the spirit they are given, with humor and friendship. He helps buy cards or presents for me and his input is pretty good. He loves his children and takes care of them as much, if not more, than their own mother does sometimes because of her illnesses. He stands by my daughter even though she tries his patience and his nerves. My daughter is no angel. She can't even begin to claim sainthood. She could keep house better. She could do alot of things better when she's feeling up to par. She knows it too. There are more examples but I won't even go into them. Why is she still with him? She sees the good things. She sees the possibilities. I applaud her and I listen when she needs an ear to chew on. This is her life to work out, not mine. I've been there, gotten the t-shirt and shredded the damn thing, moved on. As for me, I like my sanity, what little I have left. I stay out of it. I don't even offer advise. Most times when I think about FB, I still want that shovel.
....or was it intentional? I've noticed there are a lot of little things Mom forgot to tell me about and now that I am a mother myself, I'm beginning to think it was intentional. I think it's all part of that "just you wait" mentality. It's all part of the Mother's Curse, I believe. I'm referring to children in case I've lost anyone. Things like... My daughter has a family of her own now and since she moved back up into the same town as I am, she calls everyday. Okay, let's be honest here, she calls many times a day. Sometimes I wonder why she called at all at certain times. When she doesn't call, I worry. Something surely has to be wrong, right? Now if I could just get her down to one or two phone calls a day Maybe that's why I take vacations and only leave the room info with my kid brother and I turn off my cellphone. My oldest son is also married, celebrates his first anniversary next month. He is one of the sweetest young men I know. He's thoughtful, kind, respectful and clumsy. If there is any way for an accident to happen, he'll find it. I usually get a phone call from him to say hi and find how are things are and then casually tries to slip in the latest accident of his. I use to worry about his happiness, but since he met his new wife, that is no longer an issue. I have no concerns where she/they are concerned. I don't get calls often from him. He is doing all the things a young person needs to do to get his new life on a good path and I don't mind that. My youngest son seems to finally be getting his life together. He got out of a bad relationship about a year or so ago, moved back home and finally got his old job back. He's more mature and responsible these days. He's still a loving pain in the arse. I find ways to get even. I live to get even. He finds ways to irritate, lives for it, so things balance out. The reason I went through all of that was to show they do have lives of their own, that keep them busy so why is it their timing sucks? Is it inbred in their DNA? I noticed it from the time their awareness kicked in... the " time to mess with Mommy" awareness. You know.. those times like... no one needs me until I head off to the bathroom because nature demands it type of thing or when I think I've finally carved out that time for a private relaxing bubblebath I've always wanted and EVERY-friggin-one needs a moment of your time just as you sink into that warm water piled high with bubbles. I lived with the blissful ignorance that ONE day all that would stop. They would grow up, move out, get a life, a husband, a girlfriend, a wife and leave me in peace to have that bubblebath or just some quiet time to relax. Mom, in her sly " just you wait" silence, merely grinned inside. She knew, dammit, what I have finally come to realize, IT NEVER ENDS. Well, not until I shed these mortal clothes for another chapter beyond this world of reality and that just plain sucks. There are things here I want to enjoy...alone. I catch myself muttering to myself, " If I knew then what I know now, I'd never have had kids. " Yeah, right. Lust...love... it's all blind. You live in the moment and in a period of weakness, at some point, you decide to seal your fate and have..children. Life is never the same again. Life as you once knew it is never the same again. I've decided that I was a Marine in a former life... I've learned to adapt, overcome, improvise. Semper Fi. And I am doomed... because I wouldn't change a damn thing. When I want privacy and peace, I'm now in a position to run away from home.... hey.. maybe we do regress to our childhood.. maybe it's my turn now to give them a taste of what they've given me all these years.... On second thought... I'll just send them the Mother's Curse. Let their children deal out my justice, after all, it will at least be, oh, shall we say, three-fold?
I'm home and thankful to be so. Since I have been journalling the trip to Las Vegas, I guess it is only fitting that I finish it out, so here we go.... We decided to travel up Nevada for the trip home instead of reversing our path back up Calif. Truthfully, the hubby didn't want to chance crossing the Mohave and getting another ticket. Aside from that aspect, we wanted to see how that route was for the planned trip next year. The route was nice. To some it would seem boring but I found it less stressful....until we hit an area where there were high winds and sand storms. We were scooting right along when we came up behind a flatbed 18 wheeler hauling a M1 Brady tank, probaby on its way to Fallon. Did I mention the road is just a two-way? At any rate, the way ahead was clear, so hubby makes to pass. Halfway around the 18 wheeler, out of the sandstorm, with no headlights on, looms a white 18 wheeler, coming straight for us. At that moment, I truly believed I had met Death. There was no way I could see of us avoiding a collison of some sort, with us coming out of it, not at all. Somehow, and I am convinced of this, through Divine Grace, my mother's spirit, the expertise of my ex-deputy sheriff hubby and as much help as those 2 truckers could have provided under the conditions, I am alive today to be able to sit here and type this. In retrospect, facing Death was not like seeing my whole life flash before my eyes. That little window of a scene moved in slow motion until the moment we actually moved past the tank's 18 wheeler and back into our rightful lane, then everything seemed to catch up to speed and returned my consciousness back to the fast pace it had left for just those few moments in time. This leasson, whatever it might have been for me or my hubby or the tank 18 wheeler's driver, I KNOW there was one in it for that driver of the white 18 wheeler... drive through a sandstorm with your lights on..you never know whose life you could save. I hope he got it. I know that if the hubby had seen even a hint of headlights coming from the south bound lane, he would never have attempted to pass. When we got home and I related the incident to my kid brother, he said something to me that has given me something else to think about when I have a moment to spare. He said, " Did you ever give thought to why it was a white 18 wheeler? Of all the colors there are, what were the odds of this one being white? " I don't believe in coincidence. Everything always happens for a reason, even if we don't grasp it and maybe never will. In my lifetime of travel on the road (and believe me there has been plenty) the number of white 18 wheelers I have seen, I could count on one hand and have leftovers. Go figure. All and all, despite the tribulations, we had a good time. It was nice. It was enjoyable. I look forward to my return trip next year. Tuesday, we simply relaxed, did nothing, became mushrooms, sleeping when we wanted to, eating when our body demanded it..and Life.. including trials... is worth living.
oh my..oh my.. oh my...we just got back from seeing the Tournament of Kings at the Excalibur Hotel here in Vegas. I got us front row tickets. Now, dinner was running late because they were short staffed. By the time I started to eat, I had a mouthful of cornish hen when young... well muscle toned men entered the arena in nothing more than black tights and well, basically a thong... thought I was gonna choke. It was something my soul sis forgot to mention, thankyouverymuch. Other than that, we kicked up the noise and encouraged the others in our section. All in all, we didn't do anything super special for our anniversay, but we spent it together and it's a nice gentle, loving atmosphere we're currently sharing... so, I'm out of here. More from the grove tomorrow
Ever had one of those days when just one itty bitty thing goes wrong and it's all a downward spiral from there? Where shall I start? I went to bed Saturday morning after I sent my last entry. I even went to sleep. The alarm clock went off a few minutes later. The hubby was not ready to get up yet. We got up and moving by 6am. What time we left the homestead is a whole different ball of wax. The hubby couldn't find his wallet. We finally found it and got out of Dodge about an hour later. Got halfway there and I called home. Yep, just as I thought, hubby forgot to pack my make-up case. Now, some might be thinking, why didn't I just do it. We do things a certain way... he packs the truck. I stay out of his way. At any rate, oh well to the make-up case. Somewhere along one of the highways we were on, there was a horrific accident. One 18-wheeler and one compact car. I'm not sure what happened exactly, but I do know no one in that compact could have survived. The Mohave Desert is quite larger than I figured. It's also flat. Hubby got a speeding ticket. Cop said he clocked hubby doing 95 in a 65. That would be quite correct. Good thing we found his wallet. Btw, did I mention, I was not leaving home without the wallet. Good thing too. He hasn't gotten a ticket in 7 years. Hot damn, Momma gets a new outfit equivalent to the price of one speeding ticket. He barely managed to avoid any more. Needless to say, we checked in around 8:00-8:30pm. We had to go out and buy a few things and pick up something to eat. By 11:00pm, I took an ibuprofen, 600mg and crashed. I woke up this morning in time to watch the sun come up then dozed on the couch until about noon. That was nice for a change. We headed over to the Excalibur to pick up our tickets for " The Tournament of Kings" tomorrow night. We also roamed around and bought a few things to take back. We bought the grandkids swords and shields. Yea, verily, I say unto you, their mother is going to loved me for it...NOT. Then we took the tram over to the Luxor and roamed around there. Hubby has convinced me to to do the 3D thing of the Haunted House and maybe even the ride there, kinda like the Star Wars ride in theatre they have at Disneyland, at the Luxor tomorrow. He wants to do the 3D thing of NASCAR. I told him to go ahead, I'd puke if I did it with him. We saw Penn and Teller tonight at the Rio. It was cool. Although I didn't like the part of putting the cute bunny in the wood chipper. Yes, I know it didn't really happen. It's always the short quiet ones that have a warped mind. Gotta love it. Other than not managing to get into 2 car accidents, we're doing good and relaxing. We'll definitely come back. This time share was a good investment.
Apparently I am not going to be allowed to sleep until we're on the road today. If our calculations are right, if I know my hubby, we'll be in Vegas in 8 hours commencing at 6am, that also includes a small stop to top off the gas tank. It will have to do. Once awake, the hubby has to drive. He may even drive the whole trip. We don't have anything planned for tonight so he can rest his back in the whirlpool tub once we check in. So, why am I not asleep this early? My toothache. I think an internet friend of mine is on the right track. Since the tooth in question has had a root canal and I am guilty of crunching ice, mainly on that side, I think I overly stressed it. It wasn't hurting during the day but after a late dinner(and yes, E, I ate on the opposite side) and a hastily thrown together suitcase, I settled down to sleep and no such luck. I am not going to let something as small as a toothache keep me from enjoying the next four days in Vegas. I am not a gambler and for this trip, not much for sight-seeing either. These next four days are for de-stressing, vegging and hopefully being creative before I am launched into our new working season. I am all right with that. The past three months have been stressful in making ends meet. Hm. Maybe I am not putting that right. It has been stressful worrying about the next month. Yet, some part part of me has always had faith that the Lady's Grace would be there. She hasn't let me down yet. Oh, I've had to work at it, nothing comes without a price, but.... I think the worst of it is over, at least financially. I do not care for roller coaster rides. I do not care for the " ant and grasshopper " analogy. So, this year, I make sure it doesn't happen again. The business shows signs of doing quite well this year and if I can incorporate the word " organization" into my hubby's vocab, I may even get to keep my sanity... wait... I forgot about the children... ok... how about a small piece of my sanity then? That sounds reasonable. This early in the morning, all kinds of thoughts meander through my gray matter. Yes, I now have possession of " The Cell ". That's another blog for another day. Suffice it to say, I have a twin soul sister, Griffen QuickSilver, who lives miles away from me, several states away and yet, we have a hard time knowing where one stops and the other begins. We share much between us and with a few other ladies. Ahhh, now there's another topic for another blog, this relationship I have with some ladies. I am constantly amazed by it. I just have never had girlfriends I could count on, even if they are miles and miles away. Ever had thoughts you wanted to put to paper and said to yourself, " Oh, it'll keep until later ", until later arrives and *poof* they no longer exist and you mentally kick yourself for not writing them down sooner? Well, that's me. So, hopefully, this journal will pick up some of those thoughts and if anyone gleans something from it, huzzah! If not, well, in and out. Do not repeat. Hmmm, seems Morpheus is knocking, but you know something? His timing sucks. The alarm clock is going to go off in about 15 minutes, talk about a quickie if I consent.... then again.. maybe 15 minutes is better than nothing.... Laters gators!
I've decided to move my blogging here from another site. Why? Because my soul sister decided to start hers here and another sister has her's already here. I might as well jump in here too, heaven help the general population!
I sent my hubby off a little bit ago to carry out his Honor Guard duty at the Civic Center. He's looking quite handsome in his uniform. Yes, he cleans up quite nicely, thank you. Today, he does not just represent one branch of service, today he represents all veterans, those who gave their lives and those who are still here. I read an article in yesterday's paper how the Dept of Veterans Affairs has one of the biggest budgets in our country today. I could go get the exact figures and quote them to you, but that is not my focus today. I also have read where veteran hospitals are being shut down around the country and others are being built. There are articles about the lack of prompt health care or even no health care for certain things. There was also a portion in the paper yesterday about a politician who questions if we, the people, should be caring for all the veterans' problems that aren't service connected. Can someone explain THAT one to me? How can anything not be service connected or service related? We're talking about an individual here, one body with parts. One thing always effects something else in the long run. My answer to this politician is, yes, we should be caring for our veterans, period. They offered up their lives, they went into combat, saw things, did things we can only imagine and some we can't. Many of them came home, forever changed and some never came home at all. Here, in Shasta County there was a big stink about making a veterans cemetery, a cemetery for Lady's sake. All these people wanted was someplace to bury their loved ones' remains with the honor, dignity and acknowledgment they deserved and all the politicians wanted to do was argue over who the hell was going to pay for it. It took veterans, widows of veterans and other loved ones going to Sacramento and lining the Capital steps with urns and representative caskets to get these politicians off their crabbing and actually do something. Why? Don't talk to me of money. Yes, it's a necessary evil, but we all wouldn't be worrying about money if these veterans hadn't done their job. Maybe some of those politicians should take a pay cut to show their respect for service people who made it possible for them to sit up there at Capital Hill and crab about how to run our state, spend our money or make it possible for them to live comfortably in their neat, expensive houses and drive their SUVs or have that expense account so they can smooze some guy into voting their way. Btw, we got our cemetery and with the federal monies promised, but not without compromise. At least now those widows will have someplace of honor to inter their loved ones remains instead of the urns sitting on their mantles at home. For those who are griping about what a lousy President we have, including those who even now wear the uniform, at least give a moment of thanks for those who have gone before you and made it possible for you to gripe today. Say thank you for those who now work to ensure that we never have to live in fear of random acts of violence that has such vagrant disregard for human innocence and life. While you are at it, say a prayer that we never have to live with the threat that such terrorism as we experienced with 9/11 will never touch our shores again. Human life is precious and war is a vicious evil necessity. I wish it weren't so, but until human nature evolves, there will always be someone with a great arrogance and a sadistic nature. There will also be the shining glory of courage, the belief that if freedom and peace can not be kept with talks, resolutions and respect, that there will be people out there always willing to defend and fight to the death if necessary to maintain and secure the gift of prosperity and freedom for all. For those of you who have gone before, I thank you. I owe you more than I can ever repay. Because of you, I have children and grandchildren who have wonderful lives, children who have never feared speaking their minds or have the opportunity to become what they dream of. You made it possible for me to have my dreams. You laid down your life for me and mine that we might prosper in a land that is free. For those of you who are now, May the Lady's Grace shine upon you and keep you safely so that you may return to your loved ones and bear the torch so all those who sacrificed so much will not be forgotten. Thank you for your dedication, willingness to serve and your faith in the very principles that this country is built upon. Thank you for believing in the necessity. Thank you for showing compassion. One day there will be a time when arrogance and greed will be subdued before it can even come to any kind of dark fruition so that humanity will never have to bear scars. Until then, I thank the Lady that there are those who are willing to brave the shadows and secure the Light.
Have you ever wondered what happened to someone from your past? It doesn't happen to me very often, more like once in a blue moon. I am not one to look backwards. He was a MSG in the Army, stationed at Schofield Barracks, Field Artillery. I had never met a man like him before or since. As far as I can gather, he still lives in Virginia. I was working for a prominent non-profit on Schofield back then. I still live here, in Northern Calif, where I told him I was going upon leaving the island. Our story doesn't matter except for me to say that I hope he has found some happiness, some peace in his life. He meant a great deal to me back then and he will always mean a great deal to me. He gave me back a part of myself that I thought I would never recover. He gave me back faith and belief in myself. If things had been different, our lives would have been different. They don't grow men like him on trees and my Momma didn't raise a fool. However, that is all moot. Both of us at the time were going through so much turmoil and hurt. There was no other way for things to turn out other than the way they did. I know I was responsible for some of that turmoil in his life and I wish I could apologise for it, but I can't. I will not put myself in any way, shape or form, in his life again. It is better to let sleeping dogs lie. We're both different people today, I'm sure. If I had but one wish to give, it would be that L.A. is happy. Some part of me wants to know that for a fact, because he gave me so much, much more than he could ever possibly know. I guess I'll just have wish it upon a star.
If Jim Croce can ask for time in a bottle, I want to ask for some 7 year old energy in one. How do they do it? They get up early and don't slow down until it's time for bed, even then it's one last hurrah, a bedtime story. I had such high hopes for today. Did I accomplish any of them? Nope. What did I do instead? I humored a little seven year old girl. We played, we baked (pineapple upside down cake from scratch), we sent email to each other, we watched the antics of Mr. Bear, Penguin and the Taco Bell Dog and had giggling fits. We colored pictures, I cut bangs and french braided hair. No doubt before she goes home sometime tomorrow I'll be sporting a colorful new look all under the guise of a makeover. Maybe I can apply as understudy for the Drew Carey Show. Mimi won't hold a candle to me. My little makeup artist is rather good at makeup actually. She should be, grandma use to design makeup charts and apply it for stage productions. She just likes to believe she shocks me and I let her. My writing partner is an angel. I totally ignored him today when I had mentioned I hoped to be able to play. He's also the reason for the shared giggles and for that I could kiss him. A cyberhug will have to do. Maybe today didn't go exactly as I had hoped, but I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. One of these days I won't be around to do these things any more and Mr. Bear, Penguin and Taco Bell Dog won't be either but somewhere will be a little lady who fondly remembers her Meh-Meh and how they baked pineapple upside down cake together, how a glass got accidently broken and no one got yelled at, how peanut better on a spoon tasted so good and how the simple antics of a sweet man she never met except through a computer monitor and a few stuffed animals brightened her day. Good Night Mr. Bear. Stay away from that keyboard and sweet dreams. Good Night, Sir Knight. Thank You from all of my heart.
( It isn't midnight, but hey, it's close enough)Today was filled with work, so I can play more this weekend, and today was filled with time for the grandbabies. The Grandson likes the plastic golf clubs grandma and grandpa bought (we're more commonly known as Meh-Meh and Papa. I got Meh-Meh because Pookie couldn't say Grandma and Meh-Meh came out, it stuck). The only near thing was yours truly dodging a swinging golf club. Hell yes, I yelled, that boy has a wicked swing. If there were any tornado warnings tonight, rest easy, the darn thing landed in my livingroom. I did have some deep thoughts rummaging around in my gray matter, even if it isn't my day for the Cell. That's okay though, I get an extra day...muhahaha.. I get the 31st and the 1st. Odd days, gotta love 'em. Okay back to the deep thoughts before I crash. I have very few women friends. I have never been comfortable around women. The best I can remember was when I was a little girl, even then, I was a tomboy. Maybe it was because my father wanted a boy first and he got 'em last. He raised me like a boy. Maybe it was because my mom, whom I adore, never felt comfortable with displays of affection. Whatever the reason, the bottom line is I have very few close women friends and even fewer that I feel comfortable around being simply unadorned me. The women I do call friends, I love dearly. They are funny, intelligent, insightful and just simply beautiful. I can tell the seas are rough for one of my friends and I'd like nothing better than to talk to her about it but I'm not going to. It's not a matter of letting her off the hook per se, but rather the knowledge that I've been there, done that and learned something invaluable of myself. I want her to find it too. There is no one anywhere that can change her situation but her. All her friends can talk to her until they're blue in the face and in the end, the decisions, the choices, are hers and hers alone. Life is about choices, good, bad or indifferent and in the end, it's also about tolerance. To the greater degree, we commandeer our own ship. If I don't like something on tv, I turn the channel or turn it off. If I don't like something I read in email, I delete it. Life really is simple. Don't tell me it's complicated, it's not. Excuses make it complicated. Fear makes it complicated. Each of us has to decide for ourselves what we will tolerate and put up with and what we won't. If I am putting up with something that's making me bitch, then I better shut-up and quit whining because I decided to accept things that way. Life isn't easy. If it were easy, what would be its worth? Over the course of 17 years I tolerated a lot. I made the excuses...I played the martyr.. I played the woeful drama queen... until I found myself backed into a painful corner and what does an animal do when it's backed into a corner? It finally has to fight its way out. It wasn't pleasant, it wasn't pretty and it damn well was scary as hell. I learned that I could be on my own and appreciate being alone. I worried about how to feed my family, keep clothes on their backs and how the hell I was going to fix the roof, but you know what? I managed it all and more importantly, after a time, I didn't hurt inside any more..not like that.. No woman and I mean NO WOMAN should go through that kind of emotional and mental pain. It wasn't physical. Sometimes I wish it had been, that would have been easier to deal with... slap a band-aid on it and suck it up. I knew how to do that..but to set about finding out who I was and what I was made of, that was a whole other kettle of fish. Do I have sympathy for my friend? Maybe just a little. My heart hurts with hers. In the end, it's about each of us. This is an individual journey and we only get one shot at this certain journey. We either learn to accept and live with the people in our lives the way they are or we try to find compromises we both are willing to make or we move on. Bottom Line. Friends are wonderful. They love us despite our faults. They listen to us bitch. They cry with us, they laugh with us, they reassure us. They are there when we need them for support and laughter and more importantly, for a reality check. They give us everything and let us get away with nothing. Truth hurts. Reality hurts. Love hurts. And all three Heal.
She's back. I got my baby girl back this morning. She's a bit on the reserved side and skittish. She's afraid we're going to take her back there again. They gave her a pain patch and because she is such a mellow, good dog they weren't sure if it was the after effects of surgery or the patch that made her so quiet. The doc rather err on the side of caution. They also had someone with her all night to keep a watch on her. You know, it seems like a lot of trouble to go through for an animal, not to mention the expense, at least, at one time I would have thought so. At one time there was no way I could afford that kind of care. My children are grown, they have money of their own so I can do this and besides which, these are my babies. They are like another set of kids to raise. Their capacity to love is so deep and true and selfless. Okay, so I have to make sure they get their goodies, but that's such a small thing to want in return for what they give us. I took a wee nap finally and no, I didn't get any sleep last night. Ask my hubby, if you can understand him through his yawns. Poor baby. EEP! I would write more but I better get off this thing. The sky above has opened up and I hear thunder.

My youngest just turned 20 this past April. Good kid. Really. He has his quirks. He hates having his routine, in anything, broken. It unnerves him and I know it, that's why I try to soften the edges when I can. Getting him through my divorce after 20 years, moving to new place, out in the sticks no less and eventually finding someone new to share my life with has not been easy for him. He's done good for the most part. There were rocky sailings and eventually adjustments, but like I said, he's a good kid. Give him some space and time and he comes around. The other thing he doesn't like, typical if you ask me, is that when he wants to do something and Mom puts a stick in his tricycle wheel. For instance, the other day I was taking a shower and he wanted to go hang with his friend after work. I have no problem with that. He doesn't pay rent or for anything else at the moment but paying us back for buying his car and making the necessary repairs. He's been doing that. He's almost got it paid off too. I am proud of him for showing responsibility. I think it has finally sunk in that he continues to have a few chores around the house to perform simply because he still does live here. Well, when chores get in the way of what he wants, he gets sulky. He knocked on my bathroom door and told me he wanted to go out with his friend. When I asked about his chores, I got lip and attitude. Okay, by now this young man is the third in line. Doesn't he realize I've heard it all before? I am not moved. Basically it went like this: " Mom? I'm going out for awhile, okay?" " Okay. Did you do your chores already?" " No, I'll do them when I get back. " (yeah right, we've played that game before) " No. Do them NOW. You're going to tell me you're too tired when you get back." " Mom!" (insert long whine here as my name is drawn out) " Do it! " ( more low mutterings that my 'mom ears' hear even with the shower on) " Mom, you just want to control me all the time or something. " " I'll buy you a dog collar for Christmas." Silence followed by a wake of slightly stomping feet. The chores got done. His friends aren't sure what to make of me. The boyo quite fondly calls me a bitch. You must understand, it is not done in a nasty tone of voice or meant disrespectfully because if it were, all of my five foot one and half inch frame would be at his six foot frame and up in his face. He's been there, done that and doesn't like the t-shirt. I'll tell you why I don't mind it either. I am a bitch. I earned that title fair and square and I take pride in it. Ask anyone. Just ask my kids. ~grin~
Well, the mid-week hump started off fairly well. My writing partner is about. He got some sleep and was chit chatting this morning. That is always most welcomed. I also so looked forward to getting my baby girl, Cheyenne, back. Well, we were told we could go pick her up at 4pm today. ~sigh~ I just got a phone call. They want to keep her until morning. It seems like she is still in a bit more of a groggy state than they feel comfortable releasing her in. So, they asked if they can hold her until tomorrow morning. What choice do I have? Her health is of importance here. They did reassure me she is doing fine, just groggy. I am not surprised, not only did they have to hunt for the foxtail but they did the chip insertion and spaded her as well. ~pout~ I will not be completely relaxed until I have her home. At any rate, Skip has to run out so I asked him to stop by and check on her. I also want to know if they found a foxtail. My granddaughter is a hoot. My daughter and family have been living in a small 2-bedroom apartment, anything larger is so expensive around here. That was about all they could afford after FB got out of the Army. He got out shortly after the 9/11 disaster. So, everything went to hell in a handbasket as we all well know. This all means that the granddaughter, whom hence forth shall be known by Pookie, and the grandson (3 yr old) have been having to share a room. Well they are moving by the first of July into a ground three bedroom..huzzah. So, back to my point, if you can imagine how having two children share a room, a small one, both quite different from the other and being a boy and a girl. ~chuckle~ One day her mother was in another room, but had her 'mother ears' on. She heard Pookie whisper to her brother, who was being a pest, " Wait until I get my hands on you. " My daughter yells my granddaughter's name and in response Pookie yells back ever so innocently, " Yes, Momma? " Hehehehe. She didn't realize Mom heard every word until Momma gave her a lecture on threatening her brother. Hubby just called from the vet hospital. He wasn't able to see Cheyenne because of an emergency with another dog, but was reassured that our girl was resting comfortably and being thoroughly spoiled by the staff and eating it up too. Tomorrow morning after 9 am. Looks like another long night. ~sigh~ Next subject: What to make for dinner
Well, we took the puppies in, one got shots and my wee girl is staying in until tomorrow. The vet is not sure if she has a foxtail down her nostril or has sneezed it out but the concern is it lodging in her throat or being stuck in her nose. So, they'll put her to sleep and scope it. Now normally, I would not be so worried, but we lost our golden retriever after he underwent surgery at the same place. This vet hospital is very good and it's not a matter of my faith in them, but my fear. They are also, while she is under, going to spade her and insert a micro chip. She was such a good girl today, even the vet was amazed how well she sat still, most dogs don't. She is so petite, gentle and good. I'll just be happier once we get her back. My concentration is shot, dammit. I also missed catching my writing partner online as well. I was sleeping. I'm just batting a thousand today. I think I'll call it a night and see if I can catch up on my sleep. On a different note before I go... I must remember not to take my youngest's word for a good place to eat. I took my daughter there today for lunch. It wasn't a bad place really, just, kinda, blah...the food that is. The place itself is kinda cool, covered in veterans' memorabilia.. lots of history there. So, journal.. it's one of those nights for me where I just call it a night, tomorrow's another day. Sleep well, people... until the morrow.
Okay, here's the plan, start off small and work my way up. Think it'll work? I figure if I can get myself to blog at least once a day, maybe, just maybe, I'll get myself back into the habit of writing everyday. I know that writing is different, it feels awkward when I push myself but after a few false starts, I usually can turn out something decent. It may not be perfect, it may seem ~blech~ to me, but it usually isn't as bad as I think. In the meantime, Good Morning, People! It's a lovely day here on my side of the world. Of course, I may just be loopy. I've been up since 3am. One of my babies (the shelties) has got one of those nasty little fox tails up her nose, I think. Those things worry me because they burrow in. I've seen what they can do between the toes of a dog and they will actually travel up the bloodstream or so I am told. She seems to be okay this morning, but a call to the vet is in order and a trip as well. I'm out of here. I need to pick up the daughter for our two week ritual of getting our nails done and lunch. Back later!
It was great being in Camelot tonight. There was a knighting ceremony. The Hall was filled with people, warmth, laughter, a good time as well as having a solemn reminder of what Camelot stands for and what we hold most dear. I don't want to go into depth on any one thing tonight. The hour grows late and I haven't even eaten yet and I believe the rumbling I hear is a protest from my stomach. I will say this though, Camelot has been bogged down of late with darkness, high stress, frustration, high maintenance and even maybe arrogance. The channel is not arrogant but some of its residents are. It has been a memememe scenario. Look at me, I can solve anything you put in front of me. Look at me, I have all the answers, I can do anything. There is a certain lack of depth, a shortage of trails that show how a character grows as realistically as possible. Instead of all pulling together to save Camelot, there have been individual bids, in some cases, desperate bids, to pull her together and they have dismally failed. Tonight.... tonight.. I saw Camelot as she once was, as I would like to see her again. A place where light and laughter rein... a place where, when adversity hits, all pull together to see her through. It should never fall upon any one individual's shoulders to hold her walls together. The duty lies within each of us that makes Camelot home. Tonight, trestle tables were laden with foodstuffs and drink. There were flirtations, conversations, eating and making generally merry. We need pages to be pages, squires to be squires, knights to be knights. We need to see Nobles and Ladies, dragons and animals, common folk and fae folk. To pull Camelot back from the mist she is quickly drifting into will take hard work, thankless work..there will be angry words spoken, disagreements..it will require faith and hope... much like I saw tonight... Thank you good people of Camelot.. tonight I saw her glory once more..
When I do watch tv one of the shows I never try to miss is, Extreme House Makeover. A crew of designers find a worthy person (or people) who so deserve to have their house made over. They send the occupants off for seven days somewhere with a cell phone and a laptop. Periodically, Ty calls or sends video conferencing to this people, who probably go into shock at seeing their home demolished or at least parts of it. Last night was no different. This show was about eight young people, siblings, who had lost their parents within two weeks of each other. The oldest two apparently had moved out on their own and when this happened, came home to take guardianship of their siblings. Without that sacrifice, the family more than likely would have been split up and sent to foster care. Their house was small for eight people, seven gals, one guy. By the time the Makeover team got done, there were eight bedrooms, a pool and a miniature golf course in the backyard. They gave these young people a fresh start on life. All the mementoes in the parents' bedroom were put into scrapbooks, some hung on a memory wall. There was a bathroom with seven sinks for the girls, 2 showers, a huge tub and two toilets. There was a bedroom and a private bath for the young man. I'm sure he was quite happy about that. Oh yes, and their mortgage was paid off too! The relief on their faces was heart wrenching and joyful to see. I can't begin to detail the whole episode but it still stays with me today, moreso than any other episode I have thus far seen. It even makes me feel good to see the joy, the excitement and happiness on faces of people I don't even know. It's just the thought that out there, somewhere, are people who's lives are a little easier, a little happier and all because someone cares... even strangers.

Yanno, I have a pet peeve(if you think there's only one ~snort~)....people who think it's not only their mission to educate us, but to save us. My biggest gripe at the moment? Obesity. I am by far so not the ideal stereotype woman. I am by far so not what is considered to be within the range of an ideal weight. There are many reasons I am this way, probably many bad habits picked up over the years. I am a product of my environment. I am a product of my genetic make-up. I am also a product of human injury and human experiences. When I was much younger, I didn't care. Gravity hadn't gotten a hold on me and my mind simply didn't care. Nothing in this world comes without a price and it's one I am paying for now. Now I try to educate myself. I strive everyday to make some change in a routine that is as natural to me as breathing or sleeping. Some days, I do rather well, some are eh-eh and some are just a lost cause. Age, aging is a big help. I can't eat as I use to or what I use to, not without consequences and at my age, I am a big fan of comfort, that and I'm getting too old to ignore the consequences any longer. I have no problem with people expounding the virtues of a more careful diet or what something is chock full of, what it can do to us if we keep using it or using it in large quanities. What I have a problem with is people who have decided it is their life's goal to save us all. Who made you my keeper? Who died and made you my children's parent? Don't stuff your do's and do not's down my throat. Each person is responsible for their own health, their own decisions but at least, they are their own person in pursuit of their happiness. Does that little bit ring a bell? I think you'll find it in our constitution. There's this really cool thing called, freedom of choice. So it makes you wince to see some very heavy person walk down the street. What's it to you? Get a life, better yet, work on your own. There's your focus, a life of your own..go figure. Your children don't have to be drinking that soda out of a soda machine at school. I got some news for you if you think removing them from the school is actually going to make the problem better. Better education and awareness can make them walk right past that machine, but removing their freedom of choice is only going to make them more determined to prove they are their own person. Hell, give them better eating choices and a better eating scenario at home. We really are a product of our environment. Each of us controls how much fast food we eat or our young children eat. Give us the information, give us the facts, but don't start telling me what I should or should not be doing. Who made you my keeper? I appreciate your concern, I do, really. I appreciate the vast volumes of information out there that can help me make intelligent and right choices for myself and my lifestyle. However, the next time you decide to save me from myself, don't. I am the captain of my own destiny and I like it that way.
Hmmmm... urlLink One of my friends posted this to her blog. I'll bite and do it. She's always doing these tests things in email when I ship them. I'm not all that sure I agree with most of these results, but some of them ring pretty damn close. Which ones? ~grin~ I'll leave that for those who know me well enough.

Usually around here (sometimes fondly referred to as 'The Zoo')Friday nights are quite laid back. I have the munchkins(grandkids)on Fridays. Our granddaughter usually gets to spend the night and goes home on Saturday. Our grandson gets to stay until about 8pm and then gets driven home. He's just a bit too much of handful for grandma to keep overnight yet not to mention my house is just too small right now. Plans are in the works for renovation. Tonight I don't have the kids. First off little Miss Thing got in trouble at school. She is currently suffering from end-of-the-school-year-itis. It's a syndrome that takes a perfectly sweet, good child and turns them into a brat. I don't have the boy child tonight either, Grandma is suffering from a migraine. Damn, I'm beginning to think I am due for a major overhaul, barring that, maybe they should just take me out and shove me in the compost pile and leave me there. I got the hubby to take mercy on me and go buy some bbq tri-tip for dinner so I wouldn't have to cook. Tomorrow is an early morning(6am) because of the rodeo parade. I'm not going but I get up with the hubby, get the coffee on, get him out the door, etc. My sleep is broken up, a lot on my mind, I suppose. I don't mind confessing I am worried about my writing partner.... not that I am going to lose him... just worried about him in general. We've been together for a few years now and that's saying something. He's also one of the sweetest, most dearest men I know. I worry. Hard on the heel of him is thoughts of Camelot. I just don't have the energy to go into it right now. Maybe I'll devote an entire entry to Camelot one day soon. Speaking of Camelot, I didn't get to formate those three parts I finished writing either. Maybe tomorrow morning. Right now I've got two mischievous pups sneaking off with the hubby's polishing cloths, clean and unused of course. Damn critters are sneaky and fast! I have got to take stock of my life, realize what is important and set things to order and cut what is not, adrift. I need to make myself carve out time, a certain time, for writing. There's always some thing or someone who comes along and sidetracks me from it. I have to stop that. I would love to get a sequel to my(our) current published novel well on its way. Speaking of books, if you are reading this Mr.You-Know-Who, how are the archives coming along? Been working on them? Don't make me come over there and shake you out of that family tree. While Di is busy elsewhere, you can be making the most of this time to work on your manuscript. I will now scoot my soapbox back under my bed. So, what am I going to do right this minute? After I send this? More than likely, I am going to gather up my cd player, a few cds, grab a glass of lemonade and sneak off to my bedroom. Hopefully, at some point tonight, I will emerge, log on into chat and spend some time role playing or if not, maybe whip out the laptop and put some of these dreams to words.... Now ask me what I really want... a roman bathtub, candlelight, mounds of bubbles in a scented bubblebath, a strong body to lean back against and two strong, big hands to rub these shoulders and the back of my neck until the 'world' retreats from my consciousness... hey, it could happen. ~grin~
The hubby is a joiner. He will join this club or that club or organization... you get my drift. Innocent enough dontcha think? It could be. It's also a symptom of PTSD (Post Traumatic Syndrome). I have to keep eye on him yet allow him to have a fulfilling life. The line is not always clear. On the other hand, I am not much of a joiner. If I join something I plan to give it my spare time...and like... what spare time?! Anywho... this weekend is Rodeo weekend. The marine corp league is entering a float for Saturday's parade. The hubby volunteered (yes, he does that alot too)some of our space to bring out the float so the crew can decorate it, which they did. Hubby is in the process of adding the final touches. Where do I come in? The hubby has to make two signs to hang on the float and he could not find any stencils for the letters he liked. Guess who volunteered to search her vast array of fonts, print up the words and is now sitting here outlining and cutting each of those little buggers out? Two sets! How did I get myself into this? The other thing driving me crazy? All this last minute stuff and running around like a chicken with head's cut off....ARUUUUUUGH! Okay... I did manage to do some writing today, about 3 parts worth. I just need to find some time to format it for the web page. Looks like that isn't going to be until tomorrow sometime.. Back to the alphabet ~growl~
..and trust me, it looks like a large hump to get over, already. We'll make it, that's for sure. The question is, how many aspirins will I consume before I get there? The PITA vendor is on a rampage again. I can't blame her. She's already paid the bills, she deserves her money. If I had it, I would give it to her up front and then worry about collecting it for us. It doesn't work that way. We're a very small company, very small. We have no overhead and given my husband's financial straits before we got together, a loan from someplace is out of the question. We usually don't have this much trouble. Our contractors need us and usually go out of their way to make sure we're taken care of. Bottom line to all this is, we're on it. We're doing what we can as soon as we can. I can offer nothing more except maybe to share my econo-size bottle of Excedrin. The grandson is fine. They kept him for observation until 5pm last night. In the meantime my daughter managed to get the charcoal in him. ~shudder~ Save me from root beer and french fry incentives. Hey, it got him to take the charcoal, I am grateful. Little brother came home for his day off down in Citrus Heights. He's a country boy through and through. He needed a home fix as he won't have another day off for about 9 days. The sister store to the one he works for is doing a remodel. They sent him down to help since his store is up for one next month I believe. He's about a 2 hour drive from here so it wasn't much of a hardship. He is working nights and doesn't have to be at work until 9pm tomorrow night. I know he'll be glad when this is over and he can claim his life back. I'm not feeling too good, leftovers from the abscess tooth I bet, that and getting all the pain medication out of my system. ~blech~ I also have two little shelties to bathe today and it's suppose to thunderstorm again this evening. We're suppose to be going to Sacramento to see the hubby's oncologist on Friday, which means we leave here tomorrow, spend the night and then head back, but, we're going to see if he can be checked up on by his regular doctor here instead. The price of gas is through the roof. Where's my compost blanket?
be forewarned... my writing can not express at this moment just how livid I am feeling. About a half hour ago, I received a phone call from my daughter asking if I was going to be home and can I please go pick up my granddaughter from the bus stop as my daughter and FB have to take their youngest to the hospital. My daughter told me she would explain later. I didn't bother to question her at the moment. I told her I would pick up my granddaughter. About 15 minutes ago, I got a call from my daughter, from the hospital. Apparently, FB was getting my daughter's medication for her(she was in the shower and it was one pill) and he set it down on a table or counter(I'm unclear exactly where the pill was set down)for just a minute and when he turned around, lo and behold, there stood my grandson and the pill was gone. When my daughter questioned the grandson(who is 3 yrs old)he just looked at Mom and said, " Sorry about your medicine, Mommy". My daughter was not taking any chances and they whisked the boy off the ER room, where he currently is. So far, the boy seems to be ok, but because they don't know if the lad took the pill or not, the hospital staff is going to pump charcoal into his stomach. I don't think the boy is going to voluntarily swallow it, do you? They may be keeping him overnight for observation. My rant: I have TOLD and TOLD FB and daughter about 3 year old children. They are curious and quick little buggers. My daughter is usually very good about such things. FB is another matter altogether. Let me explain. FB will leave a sharp knife on the counter, within reach of young children. My daughter will come along and and get into FB's knickers about it. She'll put it safely up. FB's attitude? He'll only do it once. What she and I can't get through his thick head is, ALL IT WOULD TAKE IS ONCE! The type of injury that boy could suffer because of "only once", just the thought of it, pisses me off. Where does FB get such an attitude from? Remember me mentioning before that we are a product of our environment? Oh, you betcha, from his parents. FB's frame of mind is that the boy should know better, they have told him and told him, scolded him, punished him to leave such things alone. If the boy hurts himself, it's his own fault for not listening. Daughter and I have been trying to POUND into FB's head, you're dealing with a 3 year old toddler here. THEY DON'T KNOW BETTER! And even if they do, they forget. Besides which, if an ADULT had not left the damn thing out where a child could get to it, no one would get hurt. Pills look like candy. Grandson, like most children I know, loves candy. Everything goes into his mouth lately. Recently, we thought the boy had swallowed a penny. False alarm that. However, they have been scolding him and watching him because all manner of things, even though he knows they don't belong there, are going into the boy's mouth. The boy is smart, he knows it's Mom's medicine. He's curious. He may have gotten too curious this time. FB is flipping out. Well hell yes, he should be. He is responsible for this. He is the one who set the damn pill down within reach of his son. Maybe his son wasn't there at the moment when FB got out the pill, but he was there soon after. Will FB learn from this? I bloody well hope so, but I am not holding my breath. Why? Because experience has shown that as soon as the crisis is over, FB will find a way in his own mind to blame everyone and anyone other than himself. I better not hear of it. I more than likely will go get my shovel and start digging. So, I am soon leaving here to go get my granddaughter, whom I will take care of until FB comes to get her. I will remain civil and oh so quiet. Hopefully, that will speak volumes. I'll update later.
The last few days have centered around my mouth and the pain with an abscess under one of my teeth. Gratefully, I am now on the mend, but it was one hell of a trip. I haven't needed any type of medication since yesterday. However, what I have introduced into my system, is now working its way out. Working itself out isn't nearly as bad as dealing with the problem, but ugh! I hate feeling this bad. I've got things to do. Okay, so they're getting done slowly, a little here and a little there. I just hate it that my body does not bounce back as quickly as it use to. I think that's about the only thing I miss about youth.... wait... I could do without gravity too. No one told me gravity and getting older were best of friends.. come to think of it... it's not only gravity.. dayam.. there seems to be a whole orgy when I think about it. I'm glad they're having a blast, because I'm not. Still, growing old has it perks (and trust me none of those perks have anything to do with my body, more's the pity). My knight in shining armour finds the time to send me email to open with my morning coffee. That leaves me all warm and fuzzy and sets a smile on my face. I have friends and family.... Now... if only my body will behave itself.... I should be so lucky. ~blech~
I admit it.. I'm addicted to crunching ice. Even as a little girl, I remember wrapping an ice cube in a paper towel and sprinkling it with salt before chopping it. Don't ask. To this day, I have no earthly idea why the salt. I just know that I make my dentist shudder and I can't tell you the number of lectures I've gotten because of it. Of course, if I had known that by my mid thirties that I needed to take a calcium supplement, I would have and my teeth would be a lot stronger today. The force behind a human jaw biting down is tremendous. I should keep it in mind. About a month ago, just before we left for Vegas, I was chopping ice like crazy and somewhere during that time, I started to develop a toothache. I had oral surgery done on the tooth in question, namely a root canal. Over the Vegas weekend and in the ensuing week, my jaw started to feel better. Consequently, I started eating on that side again and viola, I'm right back where I started, maybe worse. On a pain level between one and ten, I'd say up until this morning, my pain level was a 9-10. Last night, I religiously took aspirin. This morning is the best I've felt in the last three or four days. My sleep could use improving, but I'll remedy that today. I do not want to go the dentist and have them pull this tooth and spend money I can ill afford AND money that can be better spent elsewhere than on my stupidity. So, if the worse is now over, I shall 1) have more patience with myself, 2) be more careful, 3) NO MORE ICE CRUNCHING. As for the third one, I'm addicted... I wonder if there is a 12 step program out there? Everything has been put on hold because of this... my writing.. my role playing... business...housekeeping... Aruuuuugh! I'm under strict orders to behave today.. relax, get some sleep.. blah blah blah... I have work to do, things to do...although... mutiny at this point might get me into some deep doo-doo. FB was going to come out yesterday to bring me some stuff my daughter had for my gums, stuff I forgot to pick up. With the way gas prices are these days, I said no. I'll manage. Bless his heart, he dropped it off at the house on his way to college. There are some days I just have to put my shovel away. I know he is tired. My daughter was in the ER late last night... she's fine or rather they couldn't find an explanation for the symptoms she was expressing. I still worry. Heart problems run in my family, especially my maternal side. Not a good thing. At this writing, all seems to be well. I pray it is so. Collective thoughts are bouncing around in my head.. but said head hurts too much to make sense at the moment. Sooooo, I think I'll go do what the Captain ordered... at least for now.
Everyday is Mothers' Day, it's just that sometimes..ok.. most times.. we don't get to have as nice a day as we do today. Some of us will get breakfast in bed... just think of it....a cup of coffee that has four tablespoons of coffee grounds in it because the kids are not allowed to use the coffeemaker and they wouldn't know how it is done anyway (this also goes for the Big Guy). There may be a bowl of cereal brimming to the rim, two pieces of bread, which have gone soggy by slopping milk from the cereal bowl and torn in places by the butter, a glass of orange juice which is now only half full because the rest of it is curdling the milk on the tray...and only a mother would not see the mess and eat her way through what is set before her then hug, kiss and thank those anxious eyes that are watching.... My children ordered and had delivered, yesterday, a butterfly teapot filled with flowers. I collect teapots. This one is absolutely gorgeous. The note that goes with it reads: " Mom, thank you for everything and your understanding. We love you!" Affirmation... I love it.
Over the last couple of months, no, make that, the last year, I have found it increasingly hard to role play in Camelot. Since my life changed, starting with my divorce, I have made it a point to be bluntly honest with myself. So, in this case, I asked myself... Why am I avoiding the roleplay and Camelot when both those things mean so much to me? Have I come up with any answers? I'm not sure yet. If I am blunt, one of the problems is a few certain people in the channel. Maybe they are judgment calls, personal judgment calls, but that's the way it is for me. I have found in the last couple of months I am not alone. The people who are driving me up the walls are driving others there too. There's got to be something to that. What's the solution for that one? Damned if I know at this point. What I am sure of is that these people or certain persons anyway, happen to be stifling the creativity of some. It is getting so bad that the whole atmosphere of the channel is suffering for it. I find it amazing how a channel on the cyberhighway can be so affected by the personalities of others and how that in turn affects the whole. Can't those in a position of power just eliminate the problem? For certs, however, would that merely be an abuse of power? Would it be mere vanity? The "thorns" I am sure are basically nice, good people but the bottom line is... they are PITAs (Pain In The Ass). It seems no matter how much an individual tries to talk to them, they just don't get it. No one wants to be responsible for hurting another's feelings, but dammit. Solution? I don't know. Short of getting rid of these people (by a general consensus and we'll all never agree on that I am sure), I don't have any answers except to stay clear. I don't have a problem facing or dealing with problem issues. Hell, I wouldn't have a problem in clearing the PITAs out, IF it were for the general good of the channel. However, while I may wield some power to be able to maintain the general rules for the channel, I do not have the authority to sweepingly go through it and clean it up. Come to that, who am I to make such decisions? The only solution may be to leave, which I would hate to do. I love Camelot and everything it stands for, unfortunately some there have turned the channel into an avoidance instead of a joy. I also know that there would be others to follow if I decided to leave, that was made clear to me last night. Right now, it's very tempting.... SO, where does Carl Sagan come into this? I received an email today with wallpaper for my desktop. It bore something he said and that is thus: " Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were, but without it, we go nowhere. " My imagination, my creativity, my Muse mean everything to me, without them, ~I~ am nowhere.
Yes, today is turning out to be quite nice even though I was up all night reading The Da Vinci Code. It's a book I am enjoying quite a bit. Started it last night and I am almost done with it. I can see why it is on the Best Seller's List. Later this afternoon the hubby and I are going to go over to visit friends of ours. They are an older couple who just got back from England and I can't wait to hear all about it. I always enjoy the time I spend with Jackie and Ken. They are a lovely, warm couple. I'm going over to help teach her how to use her re-write cd so she can make copies of pictures. She says she also has a million questions to ask me about the computer too. I guess this means I'll be working for my supper. ~smile~ I don't mind. The time passes so quickly when we are with them. She's making dinner and we're picking up dessert. Sounds like a plan.
Have you ever had one of those days where you shouldn't play wth machines? I'm having one~
Celebrating May Day at the Ren Faire was very nice. It got a bit warm but a good time was had by all. I didn't spend money on medieval weapons this year, nothing spoke to me. I did find this wonderful windchime with blue bells and pentagrams. I just love the sound it makes. I just need to hang it now. It's been up in the 90's but it's cooling off today and for the week. This is what I was hoping for so I can get some work done outside. My herbs, in their pots on the front lanai are doing wonderfully, including my chocolate mint (that little dickens has been the bane of my life--it dies), I am surprised and well pleased. In order not to have a wild fire at my back fence again, we're creating a green belt around the property. Oh and speaking of property, I have new neighbors to the south. We'll no longer be the first house on the right. The nice thing is, they are building their house more toward the south east of their property so I don't think I'll feel crowded in like I do to the north side. Work continues to be my master. This is not a complaint. The more bids we make on projects, the more bids we're likely to get a part of. That means money for our cruise this year. Didn't I mention the cruise? Last Decemeber we went on a 7-day cruise to the Sea of Cortez, Mexico. This year we are planning a 16 day cruise around the Hawaiian Islands. It is something I always wanted to do and it will also allow me to pay my respects to my maternal grandparents and my mother. Their ashes lie in the Puna Hongwanji on the Big Island. On a less serious note, I want to buy a rice pot!!! Yes, I know they make them here on the mainland, but it isn't the same. I have orders for 3 of them ~grin~ These types of rice pots, that I haven't found anywhere but on the islands, steams rice to perfection and it can stay heated for a few hours. The one I brought with me from Oahu finally wore out and we eat alot of rice. It's the Japanese in most of us here.~grin~ FB: Oh yes, dear reader, did you think you would get off so lightly? I'm not about to spare you, my journal and hence, those of you who read it. We all remember who FB is, right? If not, check the archives. Okay, so let us dive into FB's world or the world according to my daughter. Daughter dear has been diagnosed with CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) she has her good days and her bad. Lately, she's been having more bad than good. Now I can appreciate and understand FB's frustration as the healthy spouse. For the record, FB isn't all that healthy himself. He suffers from high blood pressure and allergies, which are bad here in the North State. He also suffers from a bad case of mememememe. Woe is me... why me... I'm-gonna-eat-some-worms-me. FB's greatest thorn is that family (as in us, his in-laws) don't offer to help out more. What it really boils down to is, why don't they offer to make my life easier? Believe me, I've taken a hard line with this one and FB in general. Daughter knows it and why. I could see my way clear to help out more IF FB made the effort to buckle down and do for himself and his without all the whining. Observation: FB would make a great Blues composer. Instead, FB rather blame everyone, especially his wife, for his woes and impending failures. FB is currently enrolled in college, working toward his degree in Business. FB is having a very hard time with Statistics and Economics. He seems to think he may be doing okay in Econ. He picks a fight with the daughter because he doesn't have enough time to study. He does have time to play his video game or help his father with dad's business. Believe me, I have nothing against him helping his dad, but that's another blog for another day and dad is a piece of work. Like I said, another blog for another day. FB is further suffering from frustration in trying to balance school, taking care of family and hearth (when it is necessary) and helping out his dad. Like I said, I would have no problem in helping him out BUT (and there's always a but in there somewhere, isn't there?) FB would take advantage of it by assuming that the matter is taken care of and therefore, he doesn't have to make any kind of effort in that direction. Wrong assumption. One, FB has ticked me off in the past over stupid crap...two, I/we won't always be around to help out..and three, if he made the effort, knuckled down and drug himself out to do it himself, I would gladly help, but FB is basically lazy. He's admitted so much himself. Why put himself out over something he can get someone else to do for him? I will say again, " We are a product of our enviroment." Guess where he got that attitude from? He has also told his wife that when he comes home from school and finds her lying on the couch, it reminds him of his mother (his mother has a host of medical problems, the forefront one being Wilson's Disease.) it's something he doesn't want to deal with. He doesn't want to understand his wife's medical condition, he doesn't want to have to assume all the responsibilities when it's time. I can't say I blame him, who does? But you know what? When you marry someone it's because you love them, because you want to spend your life with them, through sickness and health and for riches or proverty. It all doesn't matter because you love them. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, maybe there's a strength in me he just doesn't have, I don't know. I just know it's time for him to step up to the plate, quit being a whiner because there is no time for 'me' and do what he needs to do. That's what love is. You step up to the plate, you deal with whatever pitch comes your way and you don't whine or feel sorry for yourself. You just do what needs to be done because it does. FB makes me grind my teeth. My mantra is still: He will grow up, he is a good person, he really is. I have no doubt about the love he has for his children. Sometimes, I even think he loves my daughter. He just wants to 'play house' his way and Life is knocking him around trying to get his attention. One of these days he'll find out that Life, reality, is alot harsher than those romantic vision goggles he still tries to look out of and one of these days, if he isn't careful, I'm gonna snap those things while they're still on his face...just like a rubberband. In the meantime, I'm going to go out and oil up my shovel...just in case. Shift gears: Here I sit when I should be away from the chains of this computer if only for a little while. The day is beautiful with a nice breeze. Dang that hammock looks good. There's a spot of housework to be done, a bit of tinkering outside to do, oh, and look, my son the vidiot is home from work early. ~hehehe~ Hmmm... takeout pizza sounds good for dinner. I've decided. I'm closing the kitchen. Everyone cough up a couple of bucks.. who's making the pizza run anyway? What? No one wants to go? Fine. You all can starve. Personally, I have my glass of lemonade and my secret stash.. I'm not telling. It wouldn't be a secret anymore. My mother had at least two children with some sense. You all take care. Have a wonderful day and if you are at the other end of the world where your day is winding down, enjoy your evening. Life is good.
Oh my oh my oh my... yesterday. Sparks flew. I have come to the conclusion that either my hubby's memory retension is going to hell in a handbasket or he has immersed himself in so much of his extra stuff that things are slipping his mind. Needless to say, Troll and Sprout ducked and covered. Knowing me as well as they do, it was *poof* into the woodwork. I won't go into details, they aren't necessary, just suffice it to say that hubby and I got into it. In the eight years we have been together, we have never had a 'fight', they are more like spats. That is saying something. We got the daughter, FB and the babies moved into their new place. We have to still go over there today to do some last minute stuff, like pick up some stuff that is going to the dump or coming over here. I shall, at a later date, devote a whole blog to FB's latest exploits. *eye roll*. In the meantime my house looks like HELL! Between being laid up with this back problem (soft whispers again..shhh), helping with the move, nothing has gotten done. I live with three grown men and they all seem to have developed short-termed memory loss like, the dishwasher is empty, put your dirty stuff in it instead of the sink or uh, hello, the washing machine is empty, fill it. How about, there's the vacuum, is there anyone besides me that knows where the push button is to turn the dang thing on and it's really simply to use, turn button to on, push, push, push, empty canister. I just don't understand. They can find the remotes, push buttons on it but they can't work the vacuum or the dishwasher? Someone please explain that one to me. No wonder I'm a mushroom. Two out of the three can cook, do laundry and clean. I know, I have three. I am beginning to believe Sprout is a lost cause. I have not given up on him however. My oldest son is 26 years old and he has learned to do more than eat out of a can. There is hope for Sprout yet. I know he can cook, inept as he may be at it, so long as it is something simple and he's really comfortable if there is a microwave handy. I know he can do laundry, all my kids were taught how. He just chooses to take the easy way out. He's lucky other people around here like to eat and that we also decide to feed him. I've also come to the conclusion, there was STUFF mom forgot to fill me in on. I'm beginning to believe it was deliberate. That would have been right up Mom's alley. Lady Bless, I miss her so.
Well, perhaps not that bad. That little whisper before in regards to my back muscles cramping up? Forget it. Toss it out the window with the bath water. I am, however, not allowing it to slow me down until I have to. I have a new scent now. It's called, "Ben Gay". Monday is going to be interesting. The hubby is juggling his balls again. If he loses 'em, I refuse to accept responsibility. Saw the kids' new apartment, smaller but functional. It amazes me that they get away with charging $850 a month for such an apartment. Something like that use to cost about $350-450 a month. I've lived in nicer for less than what she pays and in the same city too. Amazing. Well the back is cramping up again. Relief was nice earlier. Time to go apply more of the old people cream. I am hoping to be able to sit and finish my writing tonight. Life should be so easy.
I understand that normalcy is relative to whomever. Therefore this is my 'normalcy'. Things are back to normal or at least pretty damn close. I am functional again. The knee still has a twinge but it's doable and the back (and here we whisper ever so softly) no longer has the choked up muscle. It felt great to sit at the computer today so much so I have accomplished some writing in the 2,000 word zone. Don't go looking for it yet. It's not posted to the web site as I am not done writing just yet. By tomorrow I hope to have the storyline all caught up. For anyone who doesn't know, I'm referring to the role-playing section of my personal web site. We were suppose to help the kids move this weekend, yes they got the apartment approved and now have the keys, but guess what? Our truck's alternator has died. Burial services are scheduled for Monday morning bright and early to be followed by replacement. Nothing is sacred in this world, is it? The Troll has been home for a week. That hasn't been so bad, at least he hasn't made me grow a new wart. That's the alternative to gray hair, don't you know. He did however, refer to me as old and that got him smacked with a plastic baseball bat. Troll is a big man and I had no idea big men could move so fast when chased by baseball bats. Speaking of Troll, his bearded dragon is on the lamb. No, not literally.. sheesh. Troll set his lizard out in a cage he didn't think the lizzy could slip out of. Surprise. From my best guess, the bearded dragon lizzy is somewhere under the house. Troll seems to think the lizard has slipped away and is long gone. The betting pool starts tomorrow. Either the lizard is under the house eating bugs and spiders and such and will one day emerge as a komoto dragon OR the cats will eventually drag out some lizzy bones to gnaw on. Now why doesn't anyone go under the house you might wonder? You would not send your worst enemy under there... okay.. wait... maybe your worst enemy only. We're not sure what is growing under there, what has previously died under there or ever heard that saying, " What the cat drug in?" Uh-huh. I rest my case. The prego kitty who sleeps on the coffee table has not downloaded her kittens yet. We're still in limbo there. There's a family betting pool going on as to how many and where she'll drop 'em. You know, my family bets on the strangest things. They don't seem to have a life. My hubby, the red-neck, and yes he admits to it, tried to use the old cables to charge the truck battery the other day. The negative side only had one rubber handle, the other one got lost somewhere. He tried to use it anyway and whined when he burnt his finger. He then went to Sprout's car and removed a roll of duct tape (makes you wonder why Sprout carries duct tape, doesn't it?) and proceeded to wrap the one end of the cable missing the rubber handle. Okay, will someone explain to me why he thinks that would do any good? HELLO! There's a reason why the cables have rubber handles. I had to walk away. His life insurance policy is good until Aug. 1st before we have redo it. This is the same man who just has to touch the hot wire to make sure it is working. One too many times, I swear. I also have to wonder if that's why his heart is still in good shape. There's this vintage cartoon called, " Pogo " (did you like how I handled that one? Vintage. I'm good.) and I swear to you all, the hubby was the role model for that little dude. He has a little black cloud over his head and he gets these electrical shocks. The hubby gets them so much, between you and I, I think he's beginning to like it. normalcy..yep yep..it's back and me with it.

The light dawned bright and promising early Sunday morning. It was Father's Day. Having pondered what could be done to celebrate it, something different from just going out to eat, the mushroom had a wonderful idea. After consulting with the Troll and the Sprout (henceforth the youngest child shall be nicknamed), who also thought it was a good idea and between them decided who would pay for what, it was decided we would all make a trip to the local caverns. Now the mushroom had lived in this grove for the most part of her life. She had ventured out to explore new things, but always came back to the Grove. Something she had never done was to completely explore her own backyard so the caverns seemed like a good idea. The leisurely stroll down to the waterfront to board a party boat for a quick trip across the lake was very nice as was the boat ride itself. The climb up the ramp to the the bus would have been a bit easier if someone's grandchildren (not mine) had not slowed down and nearly stopped half way up. The mushroom was on a stride you see and slowing her down like that caused her to suck wind in a not so pleasant way. It was a precedent of things to come to the unsuspecting mushroom. The winding bus ride was enjoyable up the mountain. Of course, the mushroom didn't look down the scenic 80 foot drop to the lake level. This mushroom gets vertigo. At the top of the mountain everyone disembarked into the visitors center where people took a moment to see the displays, use the restrooms, get a drink of water. Then the guide came, a pretty YOUNG thing named Lisa. She was entertaining and the mushroom was impressed as this was Lisa's third day on the job and all the things she had memorized from the handbook, in such a short time, was definitely impressive. The easy part was entering the caverns. Lisa saved the more important issues for later, once you were hooked by the beauty inside. It wasn't her fault. She did offer to take those who felt they could not make the climb back to the visitors center. Of course, the mushroom is in no way going to admit that maybe the climb would be too rough for her. Hell no. Stubborn 'shroom. So, it was in the second chamber or was it the third that Lisa advised that the next stop would be after a steep climb of about 130 steps. We had already done 30 steps then 80. What's in a number? The mushroom made sure she was at the end of the group. There was no need to hold up the younger, more long-legged, less plump members of their group. Ach, no one can claim the mushroom is not a game 'shroom. She started up those steps like a real trooper. Half way up she had to stop because she was sucking wind or trying to, into her lungs. She ignored the burning sensation in her recently healed knee. " Only a little more, " she would whisper to herself, sigh and trudge upward. At the next room she would scurry to a bench and plop down, quietly inhaling oxygen as fast as her body could absorb it, knowing that the worse of the climb was over, forgetting that there were more steps to climb but not nearly as rough. Finally, she trooped into the cathedral room and gratefully found a bench. Sprout at this point nearly got thwapped with her purse because he was being a smart ass in referring to the mushroom's age and prowess. The climb was worth every inch as the lights were turned on and showcased the walls and ceiling. Gorgeous, simply beautiful and the Lady was hiding this? What else is she hiding, I wonder? The mushroom watched two bats fly about as pictures were taken. Then there was the descent. Lady Bless. How could the 'shroom have forgotten that? What goes up, must come down. The climb up via sometimes narrow steps and narrow passageways (sometimes of which Troll had to turn sideways to get through and even then he scraped his shoulders) were nothing compared to the climb down or maybe it just seemed longer because by now the mushroom was fading fast. Mental note here: One really should ingest something more than 2 cups of coffee before becoming so active. Alas, alls well that ends well. Back at the visitors center, the Sprout sat on a post waiting, like a cat out for a morning sunning. The mushroom damn near knocked him off it for his sass. Unfortunately, Sprout is considerably younger and moves far more quickly then the fading 'shroom. That's all right. The boyo will get his. He knows how cunning the mushroom can be in her vengeance. She'll lie in wait. She is patient. This morning's light found the mushroom locked in stiff muscles, a present from her great adventure. Moving is a chore and painful. Still well worth it. However, it is not a trip she plans to make again. If she wants to see the caverns again, she'll visit her scrapbook. The pictures will be worth a 1,000 words and you can take that to the bank.
55,104.... it's a number, a large number. I tried to imagine it as marbles in glass jars. I couldn't, let alone imagine that many human beings. It starts with a very small panel near the ground, made of black, inscribed with a few names in white. The next panel is a bit larger, not much and inscribed there are a few more names than were on the panel before it. It was a gentle slope, spiraling upward and at the apex of this slope were inscribed the most names, rows of them, side by side. All told there are 55,104. So many lives given, so many still unaccounted for. Lying in tribute along the base of these panels I saw bibles, messages slipped inside plastic baggies. Some held pictures of images of babies and people, dogs and parents. Some held pictures of the serviceman who's name is inscribed on a panel of The Wall. So young. So full of hope and dreams, that is what that photo captured yet as I stood there reading, I couldn't help but wonder what that serviceman felt over there, so far from home in a hostile environment so alien from anything he had ever known. Two things hit then: One, his name was on The Wall and he was now in a far better place and two, what of the men who came home? Some of them are called "The Living Dead". Their minds can not leave that place or the people. Some of them can not live in today's society and have retreated to the forests to live off their wits. Some of them wander the streets, muttering to themselves. There is such profound silence as I walk along the seemingly neverending black panels. The silence echoes off The Wall or maybe, it resides in it. I watch the men who survived this war, men who returned and were hailed with taunts, anger and hatred for what they were sent to do, for what they did to survive, for things done that we safely here could not possibly begin to comprehend let alone understand, stop and hug each other, friend and stranger alike, for they are Brothers. I watched these men with tears in my eyes as they knelt or crouched in front of a panel and lovingly ran their fingertips against a name. There was a history there I could not hope to know but I could feel their loss. One man crouched in front of a panel, taking his time, his finger continuously rubbing one name on the panel. This man was a plane captain and the name on the panel was that of his pilot, who never returned from his last mission. Apparently the plane captain and pilot had a minor falling out and the young plane captain said some harsh words that included wishing his pilot never came back. His pilot never did. The young plane captain never meant those heated words, wished them back almost immediately. To this day, those rash heated words, spoken by a young plane captain on a flight deck all those years ago, still haunt him today. That young plane captain went on to serve 3 tours in Vietnam and became a corpman assigned to the Marines. There are also memories of injured servicemen he could not save. I am sure somewhere there are men whose lives he did save, but these are not the memories that haunt him, only his own inadequacies. The memories do not come as often now, but they still linger in the back of his mind I am sure. He is hard on himself when he does think of them, it's all part of the guilt he feels for coming back alive. That young plane captain was,is my husband..... For all things there is a purpose. I don't have to remind him that he is alive to remember and to keep the memories of those precious sacrifices in the minds and hearts of all today. He is here today to help lay to rest, with honor and dignity, those of his brethren who have also lived beyond that time and now go on to better things. Someone has to remember.... Someone has to remind us all that every person deserves to turn their face up to Freedom's Light and bask in it. Someone has to remind us that Freedom comes with a high price and that there are those willing to give that price because their humanity is greater than their own fears. 55,104 servicemen gave to their country because it was asked of them. I honor them and the tears I shed that day were not for the servicemen who are lined on those panels, they are beyond our reach and no longer need our help, but for the men who came home to live out their legacy. And somewhere out there, is another pilot, related through marriage, who is still listed as MIA, shot down over Hanoi. One day, you will be accounted for. We have not forgotten.
It has been a good weekend. Saturday we went to pay our respects to our fallen and missing heroes of the Vietnam Era. We went to the Traveling Wall. Today, Fathers' Day, Happy Father's Day to all the Dads out there, we went to Shasta Caverns. This mushroom is a stubborn one, when visiting the caverns one will walk up about 800 feet at the top and then of course one needs to walk back down. They did offer to take those who couldn't make it back down so they could wait in comfort. *snort* As some of you know, I had a knee injury about 3 years ago and reinjured it about a year after that. This past year is the first year it has truly mended without further damage *knock wood*. The gist of it is, I have overtaxed it today and now paying for it. I don't care. It was well worth the trip. It is possibly, oh hell, IT IS going to lay me up for a couple of days. Of course, I didn't even think about taking my cane or using my brace. Errands to run on the morrow.. an early night today with my knee elevated and hopefully after being a good little 'shroom, I will be able to sit down and write my thoughts about this weekend.... then again, maybe not... the grandbabies will be here. Hm, Troll is on vacation this week. He's pretty good about riding herd on them because obviously I can't this week. Maybe I will get in some writing time if the knee will allow it. I hope you all enjoyed the Summer Solstice.

It does not appear to be an oncoming train! I am cautiously optimistic as I write this. The hubby went to a business workshop today and it was productive, very. In a nutshell: 1) Our business qualifies in a special category because most of what we order is special order items. This would make allowances for the materials to be ordered by us and sent directly from the factory. The person he talked with from the Sac. office is going to work with the hubby to fix this, to include hand walking it over to the appropriate office. 2) We have just found out today that as a DVBE we have the right to be classed as a DBE as well. This has been in place over a year and a half ago. That means we missed out on a whole season of work. So, the hubby will be working on that one too. Hubby asked the State Rep that was there today about this whole matter since we just spent an ungodly amount of hours making sure they got all the paperwork they needed to clarify we still qualified as a DVBE Supplier, told we did and then this happens. Why? Apparently in recent months new DVBEs have been qualifying as a DVBE, people who should not have. This has set in motion a crack down of sorts. The snare, unfortunately, has also caught the innocent ones. So, to straighten this all out may take a week or two. The hubby has to call down to Sacramento and set up an appointment, fill out some paperwork, gather some information and then get down to Sacramento. If all goes as promised, if all goes well, if the Universe will smile and the Lady's Grace shines, a weight will be lifted. It'll mean more work, but you won't hear me complain at all. Keep a good thought, will you?
*whoosh*.... that's how I feel at the moment. No great pearls of Wisdom, no expansive view point, no insight from the Mushroom tonight, come to think of it, not even meaningless chatter. I believe I fell asleep a little after 8 pm and only just woke up about a half hour ago. I'm not sure if I am going to be awake for awhile or go back to sleep. Dishwasher is loaded, coffee pot made and set for tomorrow morning. It's still pretty warm outside. The compost pile has pretty much settled down for the night. I am looking forward to some alone time tomorrow morning. Everyone else is off to work or to a workshop. The weather is also suppose to be a bit cooler. I'll believe that when I can feel it. I do have some random thoughts I want to address on some things I've read lately, but not tonight, at least, not at the moment. Nothing witty or funny or clever to spout, so this little mushroom is just going to turn the lights out.....
I swear, it's a male thing. Okay, so there are a lot of male things, but I'll preserve some for later blogs. The male species suffers from short term memory loss when it comes to domestics. One minute you can remind them to put a used bowl in the sink and run water in it. Not even two hours later, they bring out another bowl and leave it on the counter for you to find. What? Did they lose their sense of direction as well? The sink is merely a hand span away, but the used dish didn't make it there, let alone get filled with water. It's the same thing with Time. Most men I know wear watches. Now can someone explain to me how come a man can look at that watch all day long, make it to his meetings on time and heaven forbid he misses his lunch hour, yet, he calls you on the cellphone after work to let you know he is on the way home and two hours later he's still not there? Did Hansel forget where he laid the breadcrumbs for the homeward trip? Did the birds eat them? Or did he merely consume the bread himself? And please don't even try that line of, " I lost track of time. " There's a watch on your wrist, buddy. I know you look at it. If I lost track of time where dinner preparation was concerned, there would be a major sulk and I've got news for you, that pout is u-g-l-y. I've heard it said men make good map makers. They're the only ones who understand the concept of one inch equaling a mile. So, why do they hate to stop and ask for directions when they know they are clearly lost? And how come it's all right if they badger the female in their life into doing it? To make matters worse, a little while later you get to hear all about how they knew where they were going all along. Why are men so lost in a grocery store when you give them an explicitly written list? It's got every bit of information on it they could need. The only thing missing is a picture. They can locate the potato chip aisle like a homing pigeon however. And you want to know the worst of it? No matter how hard you try, no matter what you do, your sons become the same way. It's gotta be in the DNA I tell you.
When it rains, it pours.... Daughter and FB's car is now sitting in the front of their house with what I can only guess is a broken water pump. I had to calm daughter down because she was ranting how they just got it out of the shop. She found it funny that this had happened so soon from having been in the shop and told nothing was wrong but a major tune-up was needed. I had to tell her that this was not something they could foresee. They have one of those older car models, no computer on deck. They can not afford to have this happen and unfortunately, we are not in any position to help them. The hubby went to go make sure it was the water pump, picked up FB and found out the car had been towed. Wonderful.He did get lucky, it only cost him $75.00 to get it out. That was $75.00 they could ill afford. Daughter ended up borrowing the money from her youngest brother. They still have the problem of fixing it. They don't have the money to do so themselves, not with the move coming up at the end of the month. FB is going to school. He has to attend school or get a job or they have no income. Their rent is paid via a state program. Bottom line, he'll have to find some way to get the money, buy another water pump and install it himself. Luckily for him his father-in-law has the tools he will need and the experience doing such things. It's still going to be a knuckle breaker for FB. Think that's all? FB is also on academic probation. He's grade point average falls short of 2.0. It's all his wife's fault. We won't go there. Hubby and I have been brainstorming over this problem the state has handed us. It comes down to having a 'yard' for inventory. There are two options to that one, 1) rent the space from his ex-partner or 2) use some of our acreage for storage. We have about 4 acres to use. I'm letting hubby work that one out. As far as materials go, sounds like we may have something cooking in that area too. He has to go see the man later this week. We found out that not only has this new change affected DVBEs but all businesses, DBEs, Women Owned, Minority Owned, etc. There are some people out there in the same boat. We're not so bad off as some of them are. I still believe that there is no problem that can not be solved by a little hard work, ingenuity and Divine Grace. Ask me that again in about a month, will ya? I don't know what the Cosmos is doing, maybe it's burping. I give y'all fair warning right now, buckle your safety belts, just in case...I think the ride is going to get a little bumpy. The last few days have passed so quickly and the nights even faster. I feel like I have accomplished nothing. It's an unsettling feeling to say the least. No matter what I do, it still feels the same. This too shall pass. It isn't the first time I have felt this way. I'll ride it out. I get the feeling there is something I need to be doing. I just wish I could figure out what it is. In other more mundane matters, the weather is heating up here in the Grove. It is now approaching the 100's. It's so dry this year. We didn't get the rainfall we really needed, which means working dang hard to make sure no fires come close. I've gotta get out there and get that green belt going around the house. We still have not had to install the air conditioning window units yet. The swamp cooler seems to be holding her own at the moment. Fortunately, I don't need o turn it on until mid-afternoon and it stays on until after midnight. All the bedrooms come equipped with ceiling fans so that also helps. Huge electric bills I can do without. Well, I best see to putting out the lights in the hovel. I ended up falling asleep in my rocking chair and just waking up moments before I started this post. I've got some reading to catch up on in. May Divine Grace settle upon your shoulders like a true friend, the promise of a new day bring a smile of hope to your new day and may you always remember that there is no problem that is insurmountable and there is always someone who cares... Good Night.

Let me start off by saying that this is not a whine. It is merely a chronicle of the latest happenings so that one of these days I can look back and say, " Hey that wasn't so bad. " Where do I start? Business. The people in Sacramento whose job it is to run this state, have been amending legislation. They mean well, it benefits the Disabled Veterans, it truly does, but in practically, it has been creating more problems. In our case, it's going to mean redefining how we do business. We have spent this past week talking about it a little. He has a plan, now we're waiting to see if it comes to fruition. If it doesn't, we're going to lose the business, plain and simple. I have a couple of things pending in the back of my mind that I need to research on the net. Another avenue is for me to go back to work. In one aspect, this would be a good thing. I need three more quarters to be able to collect social security. I could collect the quarters via self enterprise, but we can't afford that. Working would definitely be the answer. On the other hand it would have a devastating affect on my hubby's self worth if I did. He has prided himself all these years that even though he is disabled, he has been able to provide for me even with some help from me. My youngest has also told me that I am not going back to work, bless his heart. Like the Troll said to me last night, " Things will work out. " I wouldn't mind doing web page designs but I am not proficient enough in this area for my comfort. I also don't think I have the mentality for it...clean, clear, concise and uncluttered. I'm too much of an artist, I think. I am not happy unless I am cluttering up things. *grin* We also discussed whether or not we can be okay without the added income. I didn't gloss it over for him, for the next year and a half, it will be tight. I have been tighter than tight before, try stressing over whether or not you'll be able to keep a roof over your children's heads and food in their belly, that's tight. We'll be ok. I love writing. It's the soul of me. GQS and I wrote a book of erotica, it's now published material and we got our first royalties check, all twenty-five dollars and sixty four cents of it. Don't get me wrong, I am pleased as punch, but like I told the hubby the other day, don't count on me to make us rich any time soon. *chuckle* This past week, I have been tied up in the funeral of Ronald Reagan. Yesterday when he finally came home to rest, was so...so... well, it reached out and grabbed me, especially Mrs. Nancy Reagan. She showed us the Grace of a First Lady, allowed us to see a woman who loved her husband devotedly, and showed us vulnerability. I pray that the Lady will continue to shower this lovely woman with Grace, give her strength and hope. For no matter what your opinion is of Mrs. Reagan, one thing can not be denied, that is her love and devotion to her husband. In about two weeks I will be helping my daughter and her family move. I am so looking forward to that...um-hm, right. This should be only a mild headache, but I know my daughter. That is two weeks away though, today, I shall attempt to clear my mind with thoughtless work, like puttering around the house, inside and out. I don't have to think. I can just use my hands and it helps calm and center me. One more thing, the cat is pregnant. All my animals, save one, are fixed. This was a rescue kitty my daughter begged me to take. She couldn't have it, so I did. What can I say? I'm a sucker for cats. When I first took her, I wasn't sure how old she was, too young to come into heat though. Somehow, time has flown by me. The hubby started to say the obvious thing, " How did that happ-" Me: If you complete that sentence, I'm gonna smack you. YOU KNOW how that happened. Him: *chuckle* So, I have a preggers cat running around here. I need kittens like I need another hole in my head. In the interim, I wonder what the price is on stock in aspirin?
" Sissy! " The whisper snakes into my dreams on Monday morning at 9am. I whimpered and pushed it aside, but it would not be denied. " Sissy! Get up! " Nooooooooo. I don't wanna. I don't care what I promised. I hate shopping. I hate going to Wal Mart and Goddess knows where else the evil troll will drag me. I can always be assured when traveling with him, it's more than one store. " Sissssssy! " Damn evil troll! A pillow is flung in the general direction of the bedroom door. I could hear his evil laugh as he disappeared. I flung back the covers and got out of bed. I just knew he was capable of getting a supersoaker, brother-in-law, not withstanding. Although, I would like to see what would happen if Troll Breath did use one of those things and got the hubby instead. The Evil, nasty little troll even took me out to breakfast, like that was going to make me more amiable. But he KNEW... oh yes he did. He knew that a cup of coffee would go a long way to making me feel human and drag me back from the land of 'I-don't-wanna-return'. Evil, nasty, little troll. I love him. He's my kid brother and the only one of my siblings I lay claim to. He's a darling and a gentleman. He grew up in this house, it's his home. How did he get that nickname from me? We went to the bookstore one day and I swore I was not going to walk out of there with a new book, I had plenty. I did not count on him. He found a book called, " The Last Pendragon " by Walter Goodwater. A good read if you are curious how the author sees the times after King Arthur. He was 15 when he wrote the book. I enjoyed it. Back to the troll. He came around to where I was browsing books and handed it to me. I HAD to have it. I looked at him and called him the Evil little nasty troll. The name stuck and it's his new pet name from yours truly. He laughs. You just never know what The Grove will turn up.
I have had netscape uploaded for some time now. I decided to try it and see if I can get blogger to come up right for posting and it does, which tells me it's my IE settings. Now... if only I can figure out which ones aren't set. Then again, the way my luck is running of late, I'll just use Netscape for now until my patience returns.
It all started with the purchase of the webcam and it went downhill from there. The webcam still won't finish installing, btw. Then I had to remove and reinstall my printer software, THAT FINALLY installed all the way. Now I think the Norton Internet Security thing is acting up because when I tried to get here, to create a new blog all the boxes are scrunched together. I tried access from another computer and it's fine so it's this one that's giving me fits. I daresay I'll get it fixed. I just have to figure it out. I AM NOT a techie. The Vendor from Hell left a message on the answering machine earlier in the week. She wanted to know why his (the hubby's) wife insisted on short-changing the invoices. Call her. Pardon moi? I was livid and the hubby knew it. My job is to process checks and pay the bills. He does the invoices, posts the payments and all the assorted stuff related to making this business work. I did not appreciate her assuming that I was at fault here and neither did he. He called back the next day, she was out, but he made his displeasure known. I mailed the short-changed amount, all $43 and some odd change. Think that's the end to my week? *snort* hardly. Yesterday we're informed by CALTRANS that according to the new amendments that we do not meet the criteria as a 'supplier' for CALTRANS. It all bases around the phrase, 'commercially useful'. At any rate, we've sort of come to a sort of standstill and I am not sure what lies ahead. I have some research to do and the hubby says he can meet the criteria within a week. We'll see. I get the grandbabies today. It happens to be my daughter and FB's anniversary and I took the kids so they could go out. OH yes! I forgot to mention a few moments ago, the evil little troll (I'll fill you in on who that is later) went to take a shower and had turned on the hot water. The faucet apparently popped off. He was lucky he got out of the shower without burning himself. I really want to say that sentence, but I refuse to tempt the Universe to do anything more. Someone pass me my compost blanket and my fuzzy slippers. *whimper*
From somewhere deep in the Grove, in her little tiny patch of compost, the Shroom stirs. It's Sunday. She looks forward to her peaceful, quiet Sunday routine. She yawns, she stretches, scratches in the most absentminded manner then stumbles through her tiny little hovel to the front entrance, all the while avoiding object de` art, curtesy of the little furballs she keeps as pets. The front door is opened minutely, just wide enough for a hand to slip through and snag up the morning paper. Oh, good, the day's supply of fodder for the compost pile has arrived. Another yawn erupts and the door is closed tightly to avoid any intrusion of the profusive sunlight that seems to be streaming everywhere outdoors. Shuffling sounds resound through her tiny domain, pinpointed in the direction of the kitchen and the coffeepot, must have coffee for survival. Through squinted eyes the coffee finds it way into a mug, creamer is added and a hasty stir is given before she places the morning's delivery under her armpit, clamped there by extremely well defined muscles in that area, as she clutches her prize possession between two hands. There is more shuffling as her destination is the kitchen table. A soft growl is heard as she bypasses the sleeping furball, who lifts his head at the sound, wondering yet again why his Mistress insists upon making this sound. Furballs are just not interested in coffee. The fuzzy head merely flops back to the floor with a sigh and a body rollover. Coffee mug, filled with steaming goodness, is placed on the table, near at hand. The morning delivery is set beside it and the Shroom plops unladylike into an empty chair. This Shroom is not feeling anything resembling ladylike at the moment. The newspaper is flipped opened and shuffled through, keeper... keeper... compost pile fodder.. an unsteady hand reaches for the mug, lifting it to her lips and the rich creamy darkness is sucked down as quickly as its heat will allow. Oh, the glory of it! The peace, the quiet...the only sound is the rustle of a turning page and the sucking noise of mana from a warm mug. Then it happens. Without warning, without forethought, the sound of NASCAR racing BLARES throughout the tiny hovel via modern technology called, Surround Sound. Newsprint flies everywhere. The nectar of the Gods spill and the Shroom must now be scraped from the ceiling.
Well, at the moment "The Zoo" is quiet. No one here but the resident zookeepers. Wanna bet it doesn't stay this peaceful? It's a sucker bet, don't take me up on it. I've been up since nine, but didn't get to the computer with my first cup of coffee until about 11 or so. Found out that my writing partner was online and had furthered the storyline a bit, especially after he read what was done last night after he left. I jumped online to chat with him a bit. It never fails to amaze me how we dovetail so well when it comes to stories. Writing with him is such a pleasure. He left to go have lunch leaving me with a quarter cup of coffee and a spinning head. Damn, I just need to get all this stuff brewing in my gray matter onto electronic paper. THIS is always what happens, I have this need to write but then in the next second, a very close second, there are things here on the homefront that need attending to. I put the home stuff first and by the time I get back to the keyboard, my desire to write has gone *poof* dammit. I got to figure a way around that. There's always so much to be done around the homestead. I never get caught up where I can just do maintenance. There's also the other matter of a different type of genre writing I want to get to. I also need to do some creative graphic manipulation to go with it. ARUGH. So, my decision? The hubby is currently watching something on TV. I shall take my second cup of coffee, hit the shower, stand under it until my mind quits twitching, get dressed see where we are in hubby's motivational state and take it from there. Somewhere, sometime today I shall get to the storyline update even if I have to stay offline to do so....maybe even entice the hubs into a Mexican lunch.. gee, I'm craving Mexican. I wonder why. *eye roll* My whine: Too many things to do, not enough time and I ain't killing myself to get it all done either.
The day has been fairly uneventful. I did get in some quality roleplay with a good friend who is a damn fine writer and roleplayer if you ask me. My writing partner, bless his heart, is still pulling early morning hours. I miss him, when he's ready, he'll be back into the action. I find it a challenge to play my character to a wide range of emotions. She may be strong, knows her heart but she still has to have vulnerability. I have to stop and think before I act, even if it means I must have her react in a way I rather not. I am constantly asking the question, how would a woman deeply in love with her husband react to the situation at hand? She can rise above some emotions but she is not some super human being that conquers everything. Most of the time, my character flows from my fingertips. There are times however, that, I truly have to stop and think. There is much in her history that is not explained yet. I'm working on it... slowly. I'm grinnng. The hubby just came home from his VFW meeting. They had a potluck and I made a dessert for him to take, 'Better Than Sex Cake'. When he told one of the ladies what he was bringing tonight she said, " What could be better than sex? " When he told me that, I grinned and replied, " Tell her chocolate, of course. " When he got home and showed me the empty pan, I laughed. I knew there would be nothing left. I asked him if the lady got a piece and he told me she did and gave her a couple of extra pieces to take home with her since her husband loved it. Nice to know they liked it so much. It's a big hit with the family too and easy to make, but I don't make it too often. Heaven forbid I should spoil them. ~grin~
Actually, I've been up since about 6 am or so. A small sheltie who shall remain nameless ~ahem~ decided she needed to 'herd' a cat or two outside my bedroom window. When that wasn't good enough she crawled under the office to give chase and then couldn't get out again. The phones are silent on this Thursday (shhhh..knock wood on that one) so I am going to try to take this opportunity to write and catch my character up in the current BlackHawke storyline. Someone come clean house for me, please?
I wouldn't exactly call it insomnia. I was tired and sleepy at a pretty decent hour. I went to bed, fell promptly asleep and now find myself awake in the early morning hours. I do this a lot and I usually don't get back to sleep until a couple of hours later. It's a dang good thing the hubby or I don't work for anyone else. I usually watch tv until I fall asleep again but that's half my problem I think. I get so into what's on, I don't go to sleep. This pattern has to change. So, here I am sitting at my desk, writing this while my cup of herbal tea cools enough to drink. It's a tea that promotes sleep and works rather well on me, when I remember to use it. Another trick of mine is to get up and do something, trick the brain into believing I'm active until it says time to go to bed, you moron. The hubby is a good soul, hard of hearing he may be, but the tv in the bedroom still keeps him awake. He's learned to sleep through it, but his sleep is broken up too and I'm sure he is not all that rested. Think what you will, but something is going on in cosmos. I'm restless. Internally. I'm not exactly satisfied with everything. It feels like...same story, different day... and trust me on this, I don't think like that. I've felt like this before, so I know it will pass in time. I also know that it has nothing to do with not being happy with my life. Sometimes, it bothers the hell out of me to feel like some sort of cosmic conduit. Sometimes....it feels like.... waves of dissatisfaction, discontent, restlessness go in one side of me and comes out the other side more balanced and peaceful. I did not eat ANYthing weird before I went to bed and there's nothing in my tea, so don't go there. Ahhh, the tea is kicking in or the brain is talking to the moron. Either way, sleep seems to be calling. Now, if I can only make it down to the hall and by the time I ease this old bod onto the bed again, fall alseep and stay that way until the heat of the morning drives me from the bedroom, I'll be doing good. Good Night, Mr. Bear, wherever you are....
Let's see... the kids got their new apartment, they move July 1st. Apparently they will have to downsize as the the new apartment is smaller then the one they're in now but each kid has their own rooms and those are pretty decent size. Daughter and I will be going through the apartment and figuring ways to be more organized and how to utilize space. The only problem I see with that is daughter only half listens to me and half carries it out. The best news of all is that Pookie doesn't have to change schools yet again. Huzzah. We had to change our cruise date to October. The business is slowly starting up which usually means we work later and I can't justify leaving invoices and payments for 16 days. By Oct. We should be slowed down enough to cruise Hawaii. The vendor from hell is appeased for the moment. We received payment by one of our slothy clients and this payment brings them up to date. Thank you Lady! The other client jumped ship as a sub-contractor so we filed a demand for payment from their bonding company. The bonding company sent back paperwork to file out and they will be in touch once they try to contact the client, good luck. We've been trying to contact the slothy client for a few months now, no response. Now if the Lady's Grace will stay with us long enough to collect from the bonding company, I may just avoid an ulcer yet. ~snort~ Like I see that written in the stars. I just want a smooth season, able to completely pay her off and then be able to say, " See ya. Thanks for the memories. " Okay, maybe not the memories. I could do well without them. It hurts me to see any of my children hurting. My youngest got into an argument with one of his closet friends yesterday. #3 son came to see me in the office last night and we had a bit of heart to heart. Bottom line is they'll get over this, like all the other times. It just might take awhile. Both of them said things that were a bit on the angry and hurtful side. There is nothing I can do to make the hurt go away or fix the problem. It must have been pretty bad, he had tears in his eyes and that doesn't happen often. I think after our talk, he was feeling a bit better. At the very least, I hope he got a different perspective on it. I think half the problem is that his friend has no sense of direction. He can't hold down a job, he can't seem to finish school. He is wandering aimlessly out there. #3 son on the other hand, is a construction apprentice, works five days week and is contemplating going to college part time. The tables have turned and I think it unsettles his friend. He's a good kid, they both are. I have every faith they will make up down the road in a few weeks. I find myself doing more and more editorial work in the business. The hubby is making costly mistakes and it isn't like you can go back and tell your clients, " Oops, sorry made a mistake here. Here's what you really owe. " They get kinda testy about that. Much of it is the hubby's medical problems. A lot of things are getting worse as he ages, but I knew that would happen and I accept my role in things. I just get a little more stressful is all. I love him and that comes with for better or worse. I just do what needs to be done. My writing partner has me ever so curious as to how he'll work himself back into the action. I hate not knowing how things are going to go. I hate waiting for them to happen and yes, dammit, I love it. The next sound heard is my forehead banging on my desktop.
I am running on one cup of coffee currently and as those who know me best know, I am not even remotely functional as a society defined human being until after the second cup is consumed, but let's see if I can fake coherency. There are two things I try desperately never to do with people I know, discuss politics or religion. I respect these people. I respect their right to their opinions and views. I do not want to get into a debate with them over such things. I am not out to change their outlook nor am I out to defend mine. Maybe that's a cop out, you know but I don't care. I've seen and felt what such discussions can cause. There are moments of discomfort, of awkwardness, of frustration. They never last, not with people who truly have meaning in you life, but still. Maybe these moments deepen a relationship, maybe they don't. One thing I am certain of is that they do make an impact. During such conversations between those I know, with myself present, I will remain uninvolved. I will make this small squeak. I highly dislike this time of year, election year. I dislike watching or listening to the conventions. Mr. Mushy will turn them on and I will walk out of the room. If we're in the bedroom, I make him turn the channel. He listens for the parties' platforms. He wants to be well informed. I applaud him for that. I just won't suffer through it. I just want to know one thing. Why does it become a necessity to hold someone or ourselves up for comparison to make a point? Why is it necessary to make this comparison in order to help solidify that one person is better than the other. It's childish. Look at me, my ball is brighter and better. Mommy! Tommy did this and Tommy didn't do that. Brandon promised! I am sick of it. Say what you believe in, say what you hope to accomplish and stand true to the person you are. Maybe that's only possible in Xanadu.
WHAT WAS I THINKING???!!! 1) I'm a good mother. 2) Things needed done and no one else was going to do it. 3) I can do this. 4) I have some things that need seeing to. This should not be too bad. 5) I had a lapse of sanity. I HATE shopping. I do. If I feel the need to go shopping it must be because I want to kill something and since society frowns on that sort of thing and I really do like using a toilet in private, I choose the next worse scenario, I shop. I am eternally grateful that this feeling only comes over me once in a great while. I tried not to think about it, shopping, daughter, two kids, many places to go and things to buy. The day started out at 9 am. I had to take Mr. Mushy over to the Veterans' Hall. The Honor Guard is presenting the colors at tomorrow's dedication of " The Field of Dreams " a ballpark this town has been wanting for ages. Yes, I know, not all that original, eh? What do you expect from a small country town anyways? Anywho, the guys had to meet with the ones pulling that pony show and go out to the field for practice, etc, etc. No big deal. We are fluid and accepting. Here in the Grove, plans change all the time. Next I had to go round up my small pack of darlings, daughter and two kids. Daughter moves slower than molasses and at this point there is a debate in The Grove whether a snail or molasses is slower. In either case, neither of them hold a plug nickel to my daughter. When I finally get her out the door and the babies loaded we set off for town. Seven hours. Yep, you heard right, I spent seven hours shopping. At some point I had to make a stop at a local store that caters to bed and bath stuff and buy a replacement coffee carafe. Mine slipped out of my hands earlier this morning and shattered on the kitchen floor as I was making morning coffee. As I straightened up from my stooped position of retrieving the replacement, I turned and what should my glazed, tired eyes spy? A BLENDER! I could have sworn that the trumpets I heard sound off in my head were as glorious as some would reconcile as blown on Judgment Day. Now why should this produce such a reaction? Troll has previously blown up every damn blender that comes into this house. I swear. Everytime he went to make something in it, he blew it up. The last one actually oozed smoke. I had vowed to NEVER, EVER buy another one. But this... I had to have it. I needed it. I wanted it... and dammit, I bought it! Can we say Hallelujah? I know we can..... HALLELUJAH!! A cold, 'girlie' drink when I get home, I thought. If you get home, some small demon whispered through my mind in an evil twisted sort of snicker. Banish that thought! I cast ye forth and never to return, evil demon. I gloriously, triumphantly paid for my coffee pot replacement and my new blender. I stepped out of that store almost a new woman, I tell you. There was once more a hopeful, small spring in my step. I gloried in the fact that the end was soon near and that I could look forward to an intimate evening with my blender. One hour and a half, three stores later, I had returned to the place I had first set out. The children were ensconced in front of the tv with their gameboys. The daughter's purchases lined her kitchen floor and after a sound thank you ringing in my ears, I was FINALLY away. One last stop. I needed to retrieve Mr. Mushy from the Veterans' Hall. He had all but melted by this time and wanted to go home. I must have gotten to the other side of town in record time. I can't be sure, I didn't check the speedometer. I scooped up Mr. Mushy and told the truck, " Home!" It went. When we arrived home, Mr. Mushy went in to get Sprout to help remove the day's purchases. There really wasn't all that much. Sprout came out and chided me. " Why didn't you tell me you were going? " " Uh, because you were asleep. " " You could have woken me up. I always tell you when I'm going out. " " You wouldn't have remembered it anyway. " " So? " He might have gotten the last word but he also got the last smack on the back of the head. I got lucky with that one. Sprout is getting faster or maybe I'm just getting slower. My most prized purchase of the day is still a virgin, sitting in its box, waiting. I am too exhausted to pull it forth, set it up and fill it up. They do shoot horses, don't they? Can I be next?
Lady save me from twenty year olds! Sprout works 5 days a week, about 8 hours a day, give or take as the Boss decides. Working private construction is a bit more flexible than working for a larger company. He leaves early in the mornings and gets back around 4 or so. Usually he goes off to shower, grabs something to eat and hides in his room to relax and play online. Weekends he usually gets out of the house when I don't have something that urgently needs to be done and I need his help with. Well, his boss is taking a week off, vacation time. This means Sprout is getting his vacation time too. Understandably he wants to go somewhere, to visit his father in Reno, Nv or his brother in Quincy, Calif. whatever it might be. I don't know if he called his father. That usually is a lost cause. I know he called his brother who can't make it down to pick Sprout up. Sprout has his own car but it's an 88 Honda, seemingly in good shape with over 100,000 miles on her. Sprout wanted to drive his car to his brother's. That's about a 3 hour drive one way. I vetoed that. First off the roads are steep, hilly and twisty. Sprout doesn't have a whole lot of drive time under him. He's a good driver. What worries me is that car of his. We don't know what the previous owner did with it. It's old and those hills will take it's toll on that car. His cell phone will black out and in the middle of nowhere and I mean nowhere, how will he get help if he breaks down? It could be hours before anyone showed up. The road to Sprout's brother's is that remote, beautiful but remote. If he had a car like Troll's I would worry of course, but not nearly so badly. It just wasn't, isn't, a good idea. He's disappointed, I understand that. I understand his frustrations. That may be the only reason I didn't rip his tongue out of his head when he was yelling that I wanted to keep him home all the time and why couldn't he take HIS car. Okay, I have a rule, a hard and fast one. I do not go 'round and 'round with my kids over something I said no to or something I don't agree with. I hear them out. I let them make their case and if I still feel rather strongly about it, it's over, that's all she wrote. The matter is closed. I am not going in circles with them so they can get their way. They didn't make their case the first time around. My mind is not changing if they revisit the issue. Nuh-uh, not happening. Did I mention I have the car covered for insurance? He can go. I can't take him and he just needs to find some other way of getting there that is safe and sane. Now unbeknownst to me, Sprout had called his brother. I find out my oldest son thought that Sprout could drive if he took the 'easier' route. I mentioned the easier route above. I told oldest son, I did not need this. I can't take any more stress. I haven't detoxed from FB of last week. I haven't been able to getaway somewhere and just de-stress and regenerate. I need it. Badly. I am in near tears overflow as it is. It isn't going to take much to set me off. I don't know what oldest son told his little brother, but Sprout has been quiet. It's not altogether a peaceful quiet, but at this point in time, I'll take anything I can get. Sprout knows better than to bring this issue up again. I pray he does, because if he is foolish I'll have to squish him and bury him next to FB's place of honor. He'd like that. Yeah, right.
Perhaps, at least until the next time. I am under no illusion that there will not be next time. There always is. He did seem to be a little subdued before he left. His attitude upon his return is something yet to be seen. Let me relate to you all that happened. We picked FB up at the apartment and met his father at the towing yard with about 10 minutes to spare before the yard closed. Hubby went inside with them because FB needed a licensed driver. I proceeded to hop into the driver's seat with every intent of meeting them back at the apartment. Did it go down that way? Pluuuuease. That would have been too easy. Hubby came out holding up a hand to stop me. I lower the window to find out that they can't get the car released. Why? SOMEbody had to go to the police station and get a red stamp on the release papers. Oh yes and pay the $130.00 recovery fee, then bring it back to the towing yard along with the registration tags and red stamped paper and they can get the car. Now FB doesn't have that kind of money. He stands around outside our truck, hoping we're going to offer to pay that since his daddy just paid out $155.00 for the impound. Hubby looks at FB and tells him he better speak with his dad and proceeds to roll up his window so we could talk. FB does an about face and does just that. Daddy dearest is not happy but is going to give FB the money. Since the towing yard closed in 10 minutes, they told us if we come back first thing in the morning, we won't charge the additional $25.00 for keeping the car. We ask if the car can be released to hubby since he is going to drive it. Nope. FB needs to be there to accept the car. Gee, FB is not happy. This means he isn't going to get down south as soon as he would like. But wait! Let's use mother-in-law's (namely me) cellphone and call the tow yard to see if daughter can pick up the car since she is on the registration (have I mentioned that FB fought over putting her on it when they bought the car because she didn't drive. Why should her name be on it?). One phone call later and it's a go because daughter is on the registration. Now we have to take FB over to his dad's, pick up the cash and run all the way to the other side of town to the police station. They don't close until 6 pm. At least we can get the red stamp, right? Wrong. I park outside of the police dept. They go inside. Again, the needed the license driver present. However, there has to be a cop at the desk to process this. No cops, they're all on patrol. Next thing I see is Mr. Mushy having some sharp words with an exiting detective. Oh Lady Bless, that's all I need. You see, I know Mr. Mushy. There are times he just doesn't know when NOT to tweak someone's tail. I roll down the passenger window, lean over and point at him. The look in my eyes by this time, speaks more than mere volumes. Six pm rolls around and out they come, did they get it? Nope. They have to go over to the local DMV, pay the college parking ticket fine of $30.00., get the tags, then go back to the police station get the stamp and THEN we can pick up the car. So, all that's left is to take FB home. Now FB is talking like daughter can do all this tomorrow, by herself, dragging two kids along. I told him I didn't think so. Daughter and I had already had that conversation while they were inside the police station. There was no telling how long the wait was going to be in each place on the morrow and I sure as hell wasn't dragging those babies out in this heat. No, FB was going to have to handle this himself. We offered to cart him around. I get a phone call later from FB. My "adopted" daughter Tiffany is going to take him to the bus station so I don't have go. Tiffany is one of those kids that got adopted by merely being a friend of the kids when they were all in high school. Ironically, I went to high school with her dad. Tiffy as we fondly call her, also offered to babysit the kids while we ran daughter around to get all this stuff done. Daughter let FB off the hook. So, early in the morning (wednesday) we headed straight for DMV and she was in and out in five minutes. Done. Next stop, Police Dept. They were in there all of 15 minutes, maybe. Done. Final stop, towing yard. That was completed in 5 maybe ten minutes. See what good karma will do for you? Trust me, when FB called, she told him that too. I found out after the fact, that FB was grumbling that we just didn't want to take the kids around with us to run all these errands (we're out to get him, don't you know). I know he was complaining because he thought he wasn't going to get to go down south. Lady forbid that he had to stay behind and actually clean up after his own mess. He surely didn't get the point of why I didn't want to haul those babies around in this heat. Self absorption. Remind me to stuff his Yule stocking with sponges this year. Well he's damn lucky his wife let him off the hook. Come to think of it, he sure was using his sucking up talent real well before he left. He was talking about a bus pass when he gets back. Yeah, he better mean it. He gets caught driving again and the cop made sure he understood, next time will be jail time and daughter can't bail him out and we aren't. Did we even get a thank you out of all this? Nary a word. Par for course. Daughter has no less than 5 medical appointments next month that I or someone will have to drive her to. Are we going to make his life easier? *snort*.
This one doesn't even rate grabbing a shovel. I swear, at the moment all I can do is sigh and shake my head. Daughter just called, oh about, 19 minutes ago. " Is Dad home? Is he busy? Does someone have a vehicle available?" Now there's a clue if ever there was one. FB decides he is going to go uptown to buy his bus ticket now so he doesn't have to worry about it at 2 am. Two blocks from the bus station, guess who gets pulled over by the local PD? Oh, you betcha by golly. What does he get pulled over for? He doesn't have his front license plate on the car. It fell off during or after the accident (that was his other ticket) Cop runs a make on the car. The registration(the one we paid for) is not complete. Why? Apparently FB got a parking ticket at the local junior college he is attending and never paid it. Did he not think it would get put into the data base or what? Next comes the check on FB's license. We all know what comes next, right? Say bye-bye car. Can we say, impound? I knew we could. Hubby goes to get FB, who at least had the sense to pull the car seat out for the grandson. FB is at the bus station. FB is on phone with wife aka daughter. Wife advises FB he is not going anywhere until this matter is taken care of. FB has had the car impounded before. Hubby now has to run daughter over to the post office to pick up a package, bring her home and is now currently sitting in the local Veteran's Hall having a cold drink. I'm proud of him, he kept his cool, bit his tongue. He's earned that drink. Here's how the situation is going to play out. FB had to call his father for the money to bail out the car. The money was not coming from anyone in this family. So, at about 4-4:30 pm PDT hubby and I will go pick up FB, meet FB's father (oh goodie) at the towing yard. FB's father will pay bill. Wait.. ready for this? FB wanted to drive his car home. Cheeeeeeeeuz. Does nothing sink into that boy's head? He was informed by his wife that no, he will not be driving that car. Hubby will drive it back to their house and park it. I will follow and pick up the hubby. Hubby looks at FB and tells him. " This is not your day. You don't need to be driving again. " When I spoke to hubby on the cell phone, hubby says to me, " That boy's karma is all messed up. " Gee, ya think? If I thought smacking FB up the side of the head with my shovel would knock some damn sense into him, I'd volunteer and gladly. I know it would be a futile exercise however. I will save my energy for something more important. Oh yes... and FB wanted to know, with everything that has happened today, if I was still going to take him to the bus station? Now, dear reader and friends... tell me, what do you think?
Yesterday my daughter called and asked if she and the family could come over and hang out a bit since they were out this way before one of her medical appointments. It was hot out and I said fine. She wanted to check because she had FB with her. In other words she wanted to see just how ticked off at him I still was. I told her my initial irritation over this latest crap was over, which translates into I'm still irritated as hell with him but I don't feel like grabbing the shovel and burying him in with the rose bushes right this moment. They didn't stay long, long enough to get a bit cooled down, long enough for Pookie to play with the babies (who btw, have all opened their eyes and are starting to play around a bit. Maybe I'll get my drawer back soon), long enough for FB to feel comfortable enough to grab some oreos and a drink. *snort*. Plans are still on for me to dump him at the bus station Wednesday morning at 2 am. His brother will be picking him up after an eight hour bus ride and then off they go to Az for about a week and a half. My writing focus has switched gears for the moment. I am hoping that such a switch will help bring my creative writing for Camelot back around. I buried myself so long into my love of medieval that I have ignored all the other genre of writing I like to indulge. Camelot is not to be forgotten nor ignored. I will continue to plod along as best I can with it, hoping something will begin to flow again. It seems I am not the only one. It appears like my writing partner also is having a rough time. Since a good deal of my inspiration comes from him, well there you go. Maybe it's been a case of "too much of a good thing"? I don't know. As I told my partner, it's a cycle and if we just tough it out, it will all come around. Then again, sometimes I just feel...lost and I can't find the damn compass. You'll find the link to the beginning offerings of one of those other forms of genre to the right of my blogs. I'm not sure why I picked the name 'Erotic Moon'. I think because there is this seductiveness to the darker edge of creativity. It rolls around on my tongue like a damn good dark chocolate, sinful, sweet, forbidden, erotic. It's not an area I dwell in for too long, but it's needful. Like the moon, I have phases and I think to fully be me, I need to indulge in them from time to time. Some part of me feels like I am running on empty again. I get this way from time to time. Someone comes along and refills me and I'm good enough to go all over. I am tired, exhausted in fact, mentally, not physically. I'm on empty emotional wise. For those of you that know me better than most, that know how it is with my personal life and more specifically my hubby, perhaps can understand what I am trying to say here. There are no complaints from me. I knew what I was getting into or had a fairly good idea of such when I started off down this path. It's hard on me from time to time and what sustains me in the long run is love. I'm as human as anyone else out there. From time to time I miss the part of me I gave up. From time to time I am just...empty and empty is not such a bad thing really. Sometimes we have to empty the container, clean it out, so that what pours back in is sparkling, clean and fortified.
I woke about around 4 am this morning, as I often do these days and I am only now beginning to shake the feeling that came over me. It's not as heart wrenching as the one I had a few days before the 9/11 attack but I can't help but think something painful is going to happen. I can't even place whether it is something that is going to happen to me or mine or within the circle of people that have a part in my everyday life or if it something that is going to befall the world again. I just know it's the same feeling that came over me before. The part I hate the most is the not knowing. It's like watching a swinging axe over my head sway back and forth and I'm helpless to stop it. Indeed, I know it is something I can't stop. What is to come, if it is time to be, will be. Some things we can change, the feeling that rides hard with this one is that, there is no choice here. It is inevitable. Some things are. Of all the gifts I am blessed with, of all the gifts I am thankful for, this one is not. Why? Because from my standpoint, it is useless. What is its point if I can't use it for something constructive? To just be some sort of....monitor just seems.... so wrong. There are so few sureties in my life. Things I just know will happen. I can't pin them down to a time frame, merely that they will come to be. I knew that Saddam would be captured. I know Osama will also pass from what power he wields. Perhaps to some, that isn't saying much. Those are things that are predictable. Perhaps. Things could have and still have the ability to go other ways. They just may. All I know for sure, deep in my gut, is that it will come to pass and it won't be years from now. The greatest surety in my life and the one that sustains me, is that I am loved. I have accomplished something with my life, modest as it may be in the greater scheme of things. People spend hours, even years trying to figure out why they came into this world and what their purpose is. I know mine. It is to make a difference, no matter how minute that may seem in my eyes given my perception of the Great Design. Everything matters, everything causes a ripple. Right or wrong, each decision, each action, has consequences and or dividends. Something must be paid back and something pays forward. Each person comes into this world with something to give and something to learn. I came into this world to love and be loved, to make a difference. I am. I do.
It's Friday. I know that means something to people who actually go out and work in the world. For me it marks another week completed and to take an evaluation to see how much of my sanity (what's left of it) has been retained, not to mention taking stock of my patience level as well. It's only 1pm pdt but for now my assessment is that I am beat. It is all I can do to merely wrap up what needs to be done for this week. Daughter and FB: Today is FB's birthday. Dare I hope FB's head may have slipped just even a millisecond out of its current resting place? In some cultures the birthday person actually gives gifts away. I would be happy for this to be mine. He is a bit more subdued. He is grumbling a bit but at least holding the attitude in check. After all, he will be taking a bus down to meet his brother so they can go visit their oldest brother in Az. He needs to take the 2am bus out of town Tuesday night/Wednesday morning. Not a problem. I am still awake at that hour, I'd be more than happy to put his arse on the bus. *insert a VERY cheesy grin here*. I was going to give Daughter about $40.00 to take FB out to dinner. I do it for the kids and spouses. However, they had to borrow $70.00 yesterday to register their car. Daughter has been very good about not borrowing money and I have been very good about keeping our purse strings closed. This needed to be done or penalties of $2.00 a day would keep racking up and I know money is super tight for them given their recent move. Besides, my daughter works off the money by doing some office work for me. FB's brother is not happy that his plans are not going his way, but he seems to be falling in with them. FB's father even agreed that my daughter had a good idea about giving FB bus fare instead of gas money. He said he was even going to suggest that himself. Well damn, my daughter actually has a good idea once in awhile. * eye roll* It use to bother her that his folks don't like her, but over the past years she has come to the conclusion that she can't do anything right where they are concerned and she will never be good enough for their son. She is past caring. However, since FB's mom is slowly dying because of Wilson's disease, my daughter does go over there to help out when there is a need. All she asks is that the responsibilities and needs of their (FB's and hers) family get met. She also refuses to allow her father-in-law to simply use them when he feels inconvenienced by his wife's illness or requirements. That in and of itself was battle and has left ill will between his parents in regards to her. To them, that's what family is for, to do whatever needs to be done. FB owes it to them. ARUGH! Now I have instilled into my daughter a sense of family, that yes, your elders deserve respect and help when it is needed but that also must be tempered by the needs of your own immediate family. Those responsibilities must come first unless the situation is so dire that seeing to your parents is paramount. There are things around here we could use help with but they are not so important to surmount the needs of her immediate family. It's all about priorities. Business: I am ready to choke the living daylights out of the company from hell, the same one that belongs to the wench from hell. it has taken them 3 months to get us the bills of laden to prove the materials were delivered as promised. The hubby was working on the claims form to submit to the bonding company and found out that the bills of laden they sent over were for invoices that were ALREADY paid for. I am grinding my teeth as I write. He called them back and advised them of the situation and told them what bills of laden he needed. It makes me wonder how in sam hell they keep their files. We'll see how long it takes them to get these to us. I don't know what the statue of limitations is to file with the bonding company, but if it doesn't happen, the wench from hell has no one to blame but herself for it. I am keeping running notes of conversations between us over it. On another note, we thought our status as suppliers was all set. Come to find out on Monday, the gentleman who told us we were set would be out all week and the other person who needed the verifying info couldn't get the verification of what we told her and of course, they haven't had a department meeting yet to share their findings. That meant we needed to reverify for this new bid that came across. No problem, I just changed the former letter sent to comply with this new project AND Mr Mushy sent down, via overnight FEDEX, a copy of schedule C from our tax return showing our inventory for 2003. We were advised that would make life easier. Let us hope so. Today: Things are quiet. Let me not say that, even mentally, too loudly. It would be tempting the Universe which seems to be taking perverse pleasure in being a pain in the arse. The temps around here are up in the 104-105 degrees F and make me move about slower. By the time the afternoon gets here, I am wilting, mentally and physically. I am hoping that in the next day or two I can actually make time for some fun and relaxation. This would include roleplaying online and maybe some writing time. There is also the continuing renovating of the kitchen and some housework that needs attending. For now, I am reveling in the simple peace that is currently surrounding me.
Well the conclusion of this test hasn't changed over the years. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or bad that my personality has remained steadfast. My results: Your Type is INFJ Introverted Intutive Feeling Judging Strength of the preferences % 44 33 22 22 The Counselor urlLink Idealists are abstract thought and speech, cooperative in reaching their goals, and directive and introverted in their interpersonal roles. Counselors focus on human potentials, think in terms of ethical values, and come easily to decisions. The small number of this type (little more than 2 percent) is regrettable, since Counselors have an unusually strong desire to contribute to the welfare of others and genuinely enjoy helping their companions. Although Counsleors tend to be private, sensitive people, and are not generally visible leaders, they nevertheless work quite intensely with those close to them, quietly exerting their influence behind the scenes with their families, friends, and colleagues. This type has great depth of personality; they are themselves complicated, and can understand and deal with complex issues and people. Counselors can be hard to get to know. They have an unusually rich inner life, but they are reserved and tend not to share their reactions except with those they trust. With their loved ones, certainly, Counselors are not reluctant to express their feelings, their face lighting up with the positive emotions, but darkening like a thunderhead with the negative. Indeed, because of their strong ability to take into themselves the feelings of others, Counselors can be hurt rather easily by those around them, which, perhaps, is one reason why they tend to be private people, mutely withdrawing from human contact. At the same time, friends who have known an Counselor for years may find sides emerging which come as a surprise. Not that they are inconsistent; Counselors value their integrity a great deal, but they have intricately woven, mysterious personalities which sometimes puzzle even them. Counselors have strong empathic abilities and can become aware of another's emotions or intentions -- good or evil -- even before that person is conscious of them. This "mind-reading" can take the form of feeling the hidden distress or illnesses of others to an extent which is difficult for other types to comprehend. Even Counselors can seldom tell how they came to penetrate others' feelings so keenly. Furthermore, the Counselor is most likely of all the types to demonstrate an ability to understand psychic phenomena and to have visions of human events, past, present, or future. What is known as ESP may well be exceptional intuitive ability-in both its forms, projection and introjection. Such supernormal intuition is found frequently in the Counselor, and can extend to people, things, and often events, taking the form of visions, episodes of foreknowledge, premonitions, auditory and visual images of things to come, as well as uncanny communications with certain individuals at a distance. You can take the urlLink test yourself.
You know, I like the hovel. It's so peaceful and quiet around here most times. Yes, there are times when the phone rings at least 20 times and thanks to caller-id, I can pick and choose. I use this feature a lot. It's dark and calm in the grove and I like being a see-nothing, know-nothing mushroom. I'm getting to be an old 'shroom. I just want to sit here and rock in my chair, count my wrinkles and not deal with youthful drama. So, noting that the situation can be as fluid as mercury, subject to change at a moment's notice, this is latest. FB couldn't get his ex-tutor to cover next week's appointment, but he had a plan. FB's brother has plans with his uncle for Monday and Tuesday so waiting to go south and then to Az after Tuesday was a no deal. What FB did come up with was this: He would stay behind, take daughter to appointment on Tuesday and then drive down to meet his brother. They would pick up brother's newly purchased vehicle and drive to Az. and be back on the 5th. They would drive back to the cousin's house and pick up their mom's jeep and FB's car and come back north. There's only one little snag I can see with this plan. FB doesn't have a valid license to drive. It's been suspended due to his impatience which resulted in a minor car accident and his two speeding tickets, all of which was achieved either in the same month or the next. Also their car is a tin can waiting to fall apart. So, daughter and I came to the same conclusion to run past these two. If brother is willing to pay for FB's gas, roundtrip, why not just get FB a one way bus ticket down south and have family down there pick him up. It would save FB's brother some money. Then the guys can go from down south to Az. This also keeps FB from driving the heap of a car. Now daughter has warned FB, you are driving on a suspended license and if you get pulled over for speeding, the CHP are going to run a make on your license and they're more than likely gonna lock his arse up and impound the car. If the car breaks down, he's foo-barred. His brother is going to have to bail his arse out and then they are going to have to decide what to do about the car. The kids don't have the money and this family, none of us, are going to get him out of the jam, should he get into one. His response has been that since daughter doesn't want him driving the car down there then maybe he shouldn't be driving at all around town either, which is blatantly saying to her that he shouldn't be running her around town when the need arises. Daughter points out that one, FB is going to drive, period. There is no way he is going to take the bus and two, at least if the car breaks down in town someone is around, close by to make sure he gets home and the car gets towed should it break down. No come back for that one. Needless to say, FB is going to speak with his brother and see what brother says. Oh yes, and FB wanted to know just how he was going to get to the bus station here in town. I advised that either Mr. Mushy or myself would be more than willing to put him on a bus going out of town. It certainly would be a pleasure to do so.
I had it! Incoming LONG Rant. Save yourselves now and go elsewhere. 1) My daughter has a few health issues. Currently, she is having tests done so the health professionals can pinpoint the problem. 2) FB's brother is home on leave(30 days), courtesy of the U.S. Army. His unit has finally left Iraq. FB's brother wants to buy his cousin's car and then go visit the oldest sibling and family in Az. FB and daughter talked about FB being able to do this. Well and fine. It was a week's worth of vacation time for FB. The problem is, daughter has appointments next week she can't miss. Daughter does not drive. Trust me, she has tried and she is an accident waiting to happen. She's just one of those people who can't do it, at least not now. There's a chance when she gets a little older she could do it. We'll see. In the meantime she has to depend on FB to take her everywhere. If FB can't do it (not won't do it), then we step in or a friend does. My daughter is very good about that. FB is having a cow because now he can't go with his brother. He has turned into a sullen little boy having a temper tantrum because we refuse to help out here. Family is suppose to help out. I have listened to this via my daughter for months and months now. She knows my position about this. I have held my tongue because I don't want him taking his damn temper out on her or that my babies become unsettled because daddy is having a hissy fit. Today, the hubby and I went over there. FB didn't come home last night. Five will get you ten, he spent the night at his parents house. His brother is there, his parents are there and he will get the support he needs for his feelings and told how right he is and wrong we are or even how wrong my daughter is. Validation came on swift heels. When we got to their apartment, FB was home. She took a little longer to answer the door than I liked. Her eyes were also red from crying. I saw the writing on the wall and I knew they had gotten into it again. At first she stood in the partially opened doorway, door behind her when she answered. I wasn't having any of that. If FB was in there and hurt her, I was gonna shred him. We stood at the door for a few chatting and she leaned over to whisper that FB's brother couldn't understand why we wouldn't take her. So, I told her why, in a voice loud enough for FB to hear. Then hard on those heels was the thought, ' To hell with this. I've had it.' FB was going to hear this straight from me. I stepped up and inside and there he sat, in his chair looking like a sullen pouty little boy. I repeated myself in case he didn't hear me the first time. I flat out told him that we weren't going to do this because she was his responsibility. I wasn't going to do this for him so he could go off gallivanting with his brother. Family is there for support, not to fill in for him when his responsibilities interfered with what he wanted to do. If his mother was in the hospital and daughter needed to go somewhere, fine. We can handle that. But I would be damned if I was going to fill in just because he can't step up to the plate and handle his responsibilities. I didn't want to hear about how she won't drive, that is old news, a done deal so he needed to quit beating a dead horse, get over it and move on. He married her. She didn't ask to become sick but she is and there are no immediate cures for it(them). I am so sick and tired of having to come to the rescue because he won't step up and do what he needs to do. Maybe if he did, I wouldn't mind doing him a favor now and then. As it is, I 'clean up' after one of his tantrums because I am not going to let my daughter or my babies suffer because FB won't get his head out of his ass. I flat out told them tonight they need to decide what the sam hell they are going to do. Either they are going to work this through or he just needs to leave. If he chooses to leave, she can't do anything about it. He made a choice and he will need to live with the consequences whatever they may be and there will be some. He is not going to run roughshod over my daughter to get custody of their son. He lost custody of his daughter by a previous marriage. He doesn't want that to happen with their son. He knows I will do whatever it takes to make sure she has damn good legal representation, if not the best this town has to offer. I am not out to see him get screwed over but I will not allow him to do it to her either. Don't get me wrong, she could have done far worse and he is basically a good person. He just needs to get his priorities straight and get his head out of his ass( did I mention that before?). I am so tired of hearing this, " When do I get time for me? " You don't. You got married, you had kids, what time? Time doesn't get to be your own until they all grow up and move out, even then your time isn't all yours, but you can damn sure control it better. They're both bad about this and trust me, I am on my daughter about things just as much. I am not blind where my children are concerned, any of them. Needless to say, the whole time I was having my say to FB he spoke not a word. My daughter even told him, " Here she is. You tell her. You have a problem with her and her decisions, now is your chance to talk to her. She's right here. " Did he? No. Truthfully, I didn't think he would. He'll bully and bluster around my daughter, but he won't get into it with me, not after the first and only time he did it. Back then, when he was feeling froggy and almighty, he bit off more than he could chew and found me right back in his face. His father tried that with me. It didn't work for him either. I have a feeling that's why his parents don't care for me. They bluster real good until you come back at them. What have I always said? "You're a product of your environment. " Of course FB's brother doesn't understand any of this. He's not married. He's younger than FB and by a few years and his last relationship was with a 16 year old high school girl he grew up with. Dynamics of a marriage are a whole lot different than just a girlfriend-boyfriend relationship. Apparently FB's brother told FB that if FB didn't come with him this time, brother wasn't ever going to ask FB to go anywhere ever again. In some small way, I feel sorry for FB. He's caught in the middle of this... family(sibling) and immediate family (wife and kids). He doesn't want to have to choose. To me, there isn't a choice to be made. His wife and kids come first, his responsibilities to them come first. He needs to grow some cajones and tell his brother that. FB just doesn't want to. Why? Because he really does want this trip away for a week, all expenses paid courtesy of little brother. Who wouldn't? By the time we got home, settled in, the phone rang. It was daughter. FB had to go to college tonight. She told me she didn't know what I said sunk in with him, but FB was looking into who he could get to take care of this for him. If there was someone who could take her to her appointments and someone to watch the kids while daughter was being seen. He is thinking of his ex-tutor. They don't live too far away and the ex-tutor has a little girl about Pookie's age. Daughter isn't saying no, but she has some stipulations.She wants to meet the ex-tutor and the mother (who may be watching the my babies) and she wants them to meet the kids and visa versa. If the kids have a real problem with the ladies, it's a no go. FB tells daughter she's too overly protective. Daughter tells FB that's not so, she is cautious. She is not leaving her children in the hands of strangers. All it takes is one time and one time may be one time too many. So, we'll see. Daughter is suppose to call me back later tonight after she talks with FB. My guess is FB is going to go spend the night at his parents' house again. I offered to take daughter to get milk for the babies and take her to get her disability paperwork tomorrow. FB, in his current mood, would grudgingly do it and make her and the babies miserable with his attitude or he would just not do it. I told daughter I expect him to handle it but I will do this if he won't. It's just one more thing he'll tick me off about. I'll do what needs to be done for the welfare of my daughter and her children. I know FB, his brother and his parents think I'm a bitch. That's not A bitch but THE bitch and it's Ms. Bitch to them.
Okay, now this is really starting to bug me. In the last four days, I've managed to evade two car accidents. On Friday afternoon, on the way home from Sacramento, I manage to avoid the car that wanted to eat Troll's bumper, the fire watchers, remember? Tonight I was on the return trip home from taking the grandson home and had just a few seconds reaction time to some punk kid with a lead foot on his gas pedal. He saw me too a few seconds later than he should have. Thank the Lady one of us was paying attention. So, I go by him, just motoring home ( in Troll's car again. Can you believe it?) and the punk is behind me, two other cars in front of me. Punk kid decides he just has to get in front of me so badly he crosses the solid do not pass yellow line, only to find himself having to pull up short why? Because there is oncoming traffic headed his way. He lays into his brakes hard. I had already seen the writing on the wall once I saw him pass me. I was already in slow gear. He slides in in front of me and about 5 yards in front of us he turns into one of those gas/convience stores. I swear he was not sane or logical. His foot was on the gas pedal when he made the turn. I just wanted the hell out of there since he was an accident waiting to happen. I was also saying a prayer of thanks that I had already delivered the grandson home to his folks. The Pookie is spending the night. I'm telling you, something is up in the Universe. I wonder if it has something to do with the dark moon we're experiencing.... GQS is in a funk... Lunacy has injured himself... and I'm avoiding accidents and trying like hell to decipher the undercurrents going on with the hubby. It's nothing I can lay a finger on exactly, but I can sense something there. I just have two questions for the Universe...... Is anything ever going to make sense again? And, do I ever get to climb up this rope instead of hanging on by the knot on the end of it? I probably should have asked about sanity somewhere in there too, but right at the moment, I'm not sure I know what that is.
The morning light added to the gleam in 'shroom's eyes. Wearing a pair of safety goggles, armed in one hand with an electric screw driver and in the other with a palm sander, 'shroom bravely tackled the first of the kitchen cabinets. They would need to be all sanded before they can be repainted. Today would be the 2 cabinets next to the stove. There was much build up from over the past 30 years to get through. Shroom was not daunted. Armed with Mr. Mushy's power tools, she slid the safety glasses in place and got to work. It must go on the record that Mr. Mushy thinks highly of his power tools. However, before he disappeared for his afternoon appointment he did set 'shroom up with the sander and the electric screw driver. Troll had gone to work and Sprout was at the bank, cashing his last two pay checks. Muhahahahaha... alone! With power tools. Now the shroom must admit to never having used power tools before. It is unclear if the reason was because she did not want to use them OR if Mr. Mushy just kept her away from his tools. Whatever the case, they were in her hands now. First, to remove the doors and their hardware. Easily enough done you'd think. However, shroom didn't count on one thing. She couldn't reach the screws in the hinges for the cabinet up above the counter, even on a two-step stepstool. Enter Sprout. Sprout generously handed over over a certain sum of money for continuous payment of past debts. Shroom thanked him and looked sufficiently ill-abled that Sprout took up the electric screwdriver and removed the cabinet doors that remained. Such a nice, loving lad. He even took the time to show 'shroom how to put sandpaper on the palm sander correctly. At this time, 'shroom has gone through three full sheets of sandpaper and having placed an emergency call to to Mr. Mushy with a request for more sandpaper, she has managed to sand the cabinets and the doors. She is awaiting the return of Mr. Mushy so she can finish up the job before replacing the doors' hardware and replacing the doors. The plan is to sand all the cabinets and doors before starting on the next phase, painting. Since they don't make cabinets such as these (without being terribly pricey), it was decided to recycle what can be recycled with a new paint job and new hardware. New cabinets will be obtained after the kitchen has been repaired and certain other aspects seen too first. Priorities. 'Shroom has come to the conclusion that she LIKES power tools. When they are in her hands, she has THE POWER. It's enough to make her dizzy or perhaps even faint. Myyyyyy prrreciousssssss. Power Tools... oh my. The saga will continue.
I know my memory's fading. I actually kept my mammogram appointment. I chose a seat next to a man and his wife in the waiting room. Both the chairs and conversations were so comfortable that before long I'd totally forgotten why I was there and asked the man. "So...what are you here for?" Talk about a showstopper. Dead silence just as "Nurse Ratchet" announced my name in her best baritone voice. I thought, "Great..a name to match the idiot." I rushed past the giggles and hurried after the angel of no mercy. Rounding the corner, I was met with, "Hi! I'm Belinda!" This perky clipboard carrier smiled from ear to ear, tilted her head to one side and crooned, "Allll I need you to do is step into this room right hereee,strip to the waist, thennnn slip on this gown. Everything clearrrr?" I'm thinking, "Belinda...try decaf. This ain't rocket science." Belinda skipped away to prepare the chamber of horrors. Call me crazy, but I suspect a man invented this machine. It takes a perfectly healthy cup size of 36-B to a size 38-LONG in less than 60 seconds. Also, girls aren't made of sugar and spice and everything nice...it's Spandex. We can be stretched, pulled and twisted over a cold 4-inch piece of square glass and still pop back into shape. With the right side finished, Belinda flipped me (literally) to the left and said, "Hmmmm. Can you stand on your tippy toes and lean in a tad so we can get everything?" Fine, I answered. I was freezing, bruised, and out of air, so why not use the remaining circulation in my legs and neck and finish me off? My body was in a holding pattern that defied gravity when we heard, then felt, zap! Complete darkness. "What?" I yelled. "Oh, maintenance is working. Bet they hit a snag." Belinda headed for the door. "Excuse me! You're not leaving are you?" I shouted. Belinda kept going and said, "Oh, you fussy puppy....the door's wide open so you'll have the emergency hall lights. I'll be righttttt backkkk." Before I could shout "NO" she disappeared. And that's exactly how Bubba and Earl, maintenance men extraordinaire, found me, half-naked and parts of me dangling from the Jaws of Life. After exchanging polite "Hi, how's it going" type greetings, Bubba (or possibly Earl) asked, to my utter disbelief, if I knew the power was off. Trying to disguise my hysteria, I replied with as much calmness as possible. "Uh, yes...yes we did, thanks." "You bet, take care," Bubba replied and waved good-bye as though we'd been standing in the line at the grocery store. Two hours later, Belinda breezes in wearing a sheepish grin and making no attempt to suppress her amusement, she said. "Oh I am soooo sorry! The power came back on and I totally forgot about you! And silly me, I went to lunch. Are we upset?" And that, Your Honour, is exactly how her head ended up between the clamps.....
A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was. So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was. The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with an unanimous "yes." The professor then produced two cups of coffee from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed. "Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, " I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important things-your God, family, your children, your health, your friends, and your favorite passions. Things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. The pebbles are the other things that matter, like your job, your house, and your car. The sand is everything else--the small stuff. "If you put the sand into the jar first," he continued, "there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner out to dinner. Play another 18. There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal. Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand." One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented. The professor smiled. "I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend."
It's five o'clock somewhere. I want a margarita. Here we go: Got up early and drove with the hubby to Sacramento for his appointment with Oncology. It's about a 2 1/2 hour drive one way. We get there about an hour and a half early because I find out Mr. Mushy thinks his appointment is an hour earlier than it is. I told him last night what time the appointment was and asked when he wanted to leave. Duh. That's okay though, it worked out. We had enough time to go have breakfast someplace together, something we don't get to do a lot. Got to his appointment on time, waited a half hour for a ten minute appointment. That's all it took. Doctor checked the labs, did a little poke, prod and listen. Mr. Mushy is fine. The doctor used the 'cured' word. I refuse to. I've had too much experience with cancer to do that. Cancer can slap you along the side of the head when you least expect it like a big old smelly fish. In three more years I'll let my guard down and in eight years, Lady willing, I'll finally believe it. Mr Mushy's liver is still doing some abnormal things, but his GP is watching it with the theory it's the meds. So, we don't have to make the trip to Sacramento again until Jan. 2005. On the way home, I drove. *insert long string of cussing here* I'm watching the guy behind me who happens to be riding my bumper. Left lane is motoring along great. That's about to abruptly change. Everyone is putting on their brakes, myself included. The difference is, I have to steer off to the left side, onto the shoulder. Why? Because dorkness behind me, Mr. Bumper Man is headed for my bumper. I also don't want my front bumper to eat the back bumper of the guy in front of me. We're not driving " The Tank" (our truck) we borrowed Troll's little truck, car, suv, whatever it's classified as. Gas for Troll's vehicle down and back cost us only about $30.00. If we had taken "The Tank" it would have cost a little over $100.00 round trip. So you can see why I wanted to be very careful with Troll's car. He has insurance, but that's not the point. The point being that I would NEVER EVER hear the end of it. He loves me, but that's his baby. Back to the story, why did everyone slam on their brakes? Because everyone wanted to watch the CDF (Calif. Division of Forestry) put out a grass fire off to the right of the road. Come on people! This is California. We have fires all the time. It's not like this is something new. Let's try not to kill each other. What's a little grass burning with water covering it? Geez. Sprout came home from work yesterday afternoon not good. What should have tipped me off was that he asked me for a glass of water while he headed straight for the bathroom. He said he was really thirsty. He works construction and has a good sized water jug. He went straight to bed, another thing not like him and it was only 5 pm. He got up when the phone rang. It was Sprout's boss checking up on him. Sprout came out late to eat and was in pain. Apparently he had this pain in his lower right groin region. My thought was his appendix. The poor lad was almost in tears. I offered to haul him down to the ER room last night. He wouldn't go. When I got up this morning I asked him how he felt. He said the pain was nearly gone, although before I left he was saying it was starting to hurt again. When I called later in the morning, Sprout had gone to work. I am still waiting on him to get home. There's been no word all day. Mama 'Shroom is a bit worried. My thoughts are that since he ran out of water, he became dehydrated and cramped up, bad. He may have also gotten some heat exhaustion in there too. He was dang tired this morning despite all the sleep he got last night. Sleep is a great healer so that tells me something is not normal with Sprout. I don't think it's his appendix although I am watching that. As my daughter so graphically put it, Sprout was not ready to rip my eyes out of their sockets when I touched the sore area last night. Graphic isn't she? They all are. I'm not sure who they get that from, their father or myself. Although I was/am worried about Sprout, I could throttle the young man. I am trying to get some idea of what kind of pain. I am asking questions, same kind the doctor is going to ask (I pointed that out to Sprout too and his response was: I'll tell him the same thing). All Sprout is saying is, it hurts. *eye roll* okay, I got that. Is it a sharp pain like someone is jabbing needles into your flesh? Is it a dull throbbing pain? All I get is, " It hurts!" Well Duh. Hopefully the kid will be home soon. I trust his boss. He's a neighbor as well and he knew Sprout wasn't up to par so he's going to keep his eye on the kid. Troll was home all day and there were no phone calls, so I am hoping all is well. Lastly but not least: CalTrans has given us the okay as a supplier. They investigated our process for supplying materials and our proof of being of commercial use. We got the green light. Of course, we had to trim some things from what we will be bidding on in the future. That's okay. So long as we remain in the game I am content. I'm not greedy. Money is nice, but slow and steady keeps me secure. This was the day before yesterday. Yesterday, we get another phone call from another CalTrans personage who verifies bids and she wanted the same info we had already provided before to someone else. So, the hubby came home today and called this personage and explained we had already been established as a legit supplier. She doesn't have the info. Apparently they are so overworked and haven't had the opportunity to have a depart. meeting to discuss all this and share info yet. What she required of us was due by the end of business today. With the phone call we now just need to check back with the other person who got the fax of info we sent over to make sure this other personage gets it. Confused? Welcome to our boat. Bottom line is she's going to check, we're going to follow up and everything should work out. From my mouth to the Lady's ear and may her Grace settle upon our shoulders. Monday. Update-4:32pm: Sprout just walked in the door. He feels fine and took a salt tablet today. He also had plenty of water. I think I can now crash and vegetate.

My name is 'Shroom and I live in a compost pile. I likes it. Yesssss, I does. It's dark in here and if I don't open the bloody door, the drama doesn't come in. Gah! I'm too bloody old to keep dealing in drama. Back when I was so young I was a drama queen and I adored my reign. It was my time, but like all queens, at some point I had to retire. I kicked the crap into the closet, slammed the door. Every now and then I hear the commotion, but I just get out the nail gun and nail that damn door shut. Sometimes, I step out of the hovel, into The Grove and the damn stuff finds me. I usually go into my 'shroom stance. Oh come on now, you've all seen mushrooms growing, I know you have. That's THE STANCE and if I'm real quiet, drama darts by and I don't have to deal with it. 'Shrooms develop a tough skin as they get older. Drama does not make me feel more alive, it wears me out. I find myself withdrawing every time I run into it or it runs into me. I acknowledge that youth needs drama. They can't help it. It's all part of that long haul. What I do have is the right not to have to bear witness to it. Do I hold it against anyone? No. I just have become more realistic and brutally truthful with myself about things and people. Sometimes, it makes me sound or seem callous. I don't mean it that way. I just don't cope well. Maybe I've become a cynic in my old age, but I look at drama and think to myself... what the hell was that in aid of and who does it serve? You can bet your bottom dollar I never thought of that when it was my turn as drama queen. No siree. But now it is my turn to wear the shoe on the other foot.. what goes around, comes around. I just hope I have a bit more patience with it. I never was a patient person.. it wasn't one of my virtues. I had it knocked into me by Life. Patience is not something you can teach. It's something you must learn. Drama.. it's the other white meat... think I'll go look in the pantry and see what else there is.
Maybe it's just dust bunnies, hm? Well, I'm certainly not getting rid of them. They keep me company. Homefront: *knock wood* All is quiet for the moment. The new babies are starting to open their eyes and getting even more rolly-polly than ever. The shelties still don't know what to make of these tiny furballs, but Bubba (aka Cherokee) has taken to being their unofficial protector. He pokes his head into the drawer when they start crying and has taken to lying right beside the drawer. Now if I could just get him to quit barking at the wandering geese at 6am, I would be so happy. Business front: All's quiet there too. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. According to the State's website, we still have our certification. There just isn't any news one way or the other. Phone calls have been placed but no return calls. Still no sign of our DBE cert either. I refuse to draw negativity, suffice it to say, it just sounds like the state. As for Da 'Shroom... well, I'm not sure. Maybe it's planetary alignment.. maybe it's even GQS (we do share a braincell)... maybe it's just me... but there's this inner sense of restlessness, of questioning... of the scales not being harmoniously balanced and I am not sure why. Being realistic I know this mood will pass, being curious, I want to know where the hell it came from and why. I am not feeling dissatisfied. I don't feel useless. I don't feel like I haven't accomplished anything with my life because I know dang well I have. Part of me dislikes the daily routine, part of me wouldn't trade it for the world. It has occurred to me that maybe I need to get away from here for a day or two, reground myself as it were. By this time last year we had gotten away a few times. With business being slow, I rather play the ant to the grasshopper. Last year it was the grasshopper's turn. It's not like I don't have projects pending or in the works because I do. I just don't think that's what is ailing me at the moment. Well, I'm bound to figure it out, sooner or later, or the mood will change. It always does. I just need to lie low and let it wash over me. When stuff like this hits me, I start doing little everyday things, simple things and everything else works itself out.
Where do I start? What a weekend. Friday's Reba McEntire concert was marvelous. She sings from the heart. She did a a song called, "Forever Love". I believe that's the title of it. The song went out to our military personnel. There were photos flashed up on the screen behind her. The final one that coincided with the end of the song was a picture of a cemetery, row upon row of simple, unadorned crosses, each flying a small US flag. I don't believe there was a dry eye in the place. The end of the concert was not to be the end, with the chanting of her name that grew louder and louder, Ms. McEntire returned to stage to do one last number. I must confess, it was my first ever concert. I just never had the opportunity to go before. Sunday afternoon The Sprout, Troll and I went to see "Arthur". The hubby had to do some volunteer work at the Veterans Hall. If you haven't seen it yet, you better leave all your preconceived ideas of Arthur, Guinevere and Merlin behind. You won't get anything you're use to seeing or reading there. It not only puts a different spin on Arthur and his knights, but it seems to offer a much more realistic view. I will admit, as much as I liked it, I still like my romantic view of Arthur too. I think the story could have been more developed in regards to the characters and perhaps in regards to Camelot too. Although "Arthur" centered more around the man, his knights and his future queen than anything else. I don't think it will be a smashing blockbuster hit in the theatre, but I know I'll buy the dvd if and when it comes out. Oh yes! One other thing. Switch gears here. Our other contractor paid off too. The wench from hell got her money over the weekend. That should keep her happy for, oh, at least a week. She'll be back to nagging us over the other account, the one that looks like the funds will come out of our own pocket since my hubby is the one who erred. Long story, don't want to go there. Luckily for us, it is not a fortune. Still, the amount is enough to make me grind my teeth over. Because I took a sabbatical from the every day, ordinary routine this weekend, I have much to do to catch up. I caught up on my writing for the moment. I'm good to go until my writing partner tosses something out. Now if only I could quit falling asleep and missing him online. The mild weather we experienced last week is coming to an end. We're headed back up into the high 90's. Ugh. Not to worry, in a few months I'll be complaining about the cold. *chuckle*
It's Thursday, already? I know for some people they are probably welcoming the thought that it's nearly the end of the work week. I remember those days. For me, since I work out of my home and the kids are grown, the days seem to blur. While the kids were in school I could keep track of the days and the calendar easier. There's no such thing as a short work week for me so, yeah, the week has flown by. There is blessed relief in that the heat has abated somewhat. We're talking mid-90's to lower 90's here. It is a delightful welcome. The hubby came home this morning from an appointment with his doctor. Everything is fine. His PSA count is within normal range. Thank the Lady for small blessings. Next Friday we go to see his oncologist. I am not expecting anything disturbing there. The hubby has not shown any signs that he had before the colon cancer was diagnosed. The blood test showed no change but they want to physically see him anyway. It's going to be a long day as we opted to drive down and drive back all in the same day. Oh! And the wench from Hell will probably be comforted. We got a check from one of our clients today. Her check is ready and waiting to be mailed. Her company is not all that far from here, perhaps five to ten minutes from my daughter's house and she's about 15 minutes away from me. We could have chosen to take the check to her directly, but I am being adverse. When this season started, she wanted not only a two party check (made out to her company and ours), which was acceptable and a few companies prefer it, but she wanted the payment mailed directly to their office. No way, no how. We gave her the opportunity to bail out of having anything further to do with us, she saw the dollar signs instead, fine, her choice, but I'll be damned if she is going to lay down terms at this late date. There is no reason why the hubby should have to make a special trip to their office just to take them the check, unless she wants to pay for the gas? I hardly think so. Some part of my mind is whispering that when they get this check, probably tomorrow or Saturday, we're going to get a phone call because she is not going to be happy that it came to us at all. Tough cookies, sister. I am not going to allow her to manipulate us, hence my adversity. We expect another check from the other client, probably tomorrow. Switch gears. The babies are still in my bottom drawer. I have removed my clothing. Sigh. The things I do for the animals around here sometimes. I must be getting old and soft in the head. I was just falling asleep last night and a couple of the babies started up crying. I grabbed a flashlight and went to check on them, hard on my heels was Cheyenne, my female sheltie. We both peered into the drawer and I surmised that the commotion was raised by the fact that one of them either got his milk jug stolen or he couldn't find one. I'm tired. I am not hunting around to find him one either, he can find his own. It's every kitten for themselves, bud..have at it. Cheyenne and I went back to bed. I have to feel for Serenity (mama cat) she is a perpetual milking machine that works on a 24/7 basis. I think I've found some of the reason for my sleeplessness, a few pebbles in the road of marital bliss as it were. They are things I have to work through and finding some clarity here is not an easy thing. I guess it comes down to what is acceptable to me, what I can live with and what I can't. It's also facing answers of whether or not he can change, how does it all fit into his mental health and who does it damage more, him or I in regards to changes or no changes. It all sounds cryptic to you out there, I know. I am being deliberately vague. One always has to be constantly aware that this is a public journal and sometimes you can't just live in the fish bowl... sometimes, you have to go inside the house. Plans for this weekend include: Going to the Reba McEntire concert tomorrow evening. Our oldest son and his wife will be there too. I am looking forward to spending some time with them and enjoying the concert. Tentative plans to see " Arthur " at the theatre on Sunday afternoon.
The new babies are doing well, getting fat. The litter consists of, 2 blacks, 2 grays and two whites. They also break down into 3 males and 3 females. Btw, Sprout won the numbers pool. The weather this week is suppose to cool down and today seems to be proving it. Yesterday it was 108 degrees F. Today was in the high 90's. It's suppose to cool off as the week progresses. I haven't been sleeping well at nights, staying up until about 3 or 4 am. I manage to drift off, but I always seem to wake right back up. I don't know what is causing it, but I sure wish it would resolve itself. I also find myself waking up around 6am or so. Yes, I have deep shadows under my eyes, so attractive *snort*. The wench from hell called yesterday, made my teeth grind. Mr. Mushroom (or Mushy as I fondly call him) called her right back. Hell, I don't know what her problem is. We told her we were looking to get paid this week. It was a long weekend and only the first working day of it. Sheesh. We also got on her about some bills of laden for a claim we need to file with a bonding company in regards to a construction company that bailed out. It's been three months now that we've been requesting it. She mumbled something about making some phone calls. We're talking $14,000.00 here. Hello! The good news is, the companies that owe us money (which we owe to the wench from hell) advised checks went out today. Okay, the check is in the mail... it had better be. I want this woman off our backs so we can stop doing business with her. Of course that isn't going to happen anytime soon, especially until we get this delinquent account off our hands. I hope the weather does cool down. We have tickets to see Reba McEntire in concert Friday night. It's an outdoor concert, so I don't want to be sweating up a storm... hm, what to wear... yes, definitely clothes... something that keeps the pesty bugs at bay and is still cool. That's all I can think of for right now from The Grove. I need a nap.

At about 7:30 am the 'shroom was abruptly pulled from a deep sleep and a weird dream (so she was thankful) by a sound she has known forever. It was a distressed little cry. Leaning over, she shook Mr. Mushy awake and told him she needed his help. The distress call was ongoing and with a bit of thankful silence in the compost pile, she was able to locate the sound. It was coming from her bottom clothing dresser drawer, where she kept her pants and shorts. There lying on the folded clean clothing was the preggers kitty and after digging into the drawer, 'shroom located the newly born kitten that apparently had slid off the clothing and down into a crack between clothes and the drawer front. Da `shroom sent Mr. Mushy out to get an old sheet in the garage, set there for just this occasion. In the meantime, 'shroom set about removing her clothing, speaking softly to the new mother, who was in the throes of delivering another baby. Swiftly as she could, she removed what clothing she could and laid out the old sheet. Now Mr. Mushy has raised pedigree dogs for most of his life. He has even delivered a few foals in his time, but kitties are out of his forte. 'Shroom informed him that the new momma will take care of birthing and cleaning up all by herself. 'Shroom did watch over her though. The dogs were banished from the bedroom for the delivery. They were not pleased. They will get over it. Miss Serenity, the hussy cat, now new mommy, has delivered 6 very hungry babies and the last two are pure white. That is unusual as Miss Serenity and who the household believe to be the daddy, are not white. Now `shroom excelled in genetics in school, so she knows very well how this all works and the possibilities. Right now, she shaking her head over the fact that the 'Zoo' has now grown by six. The idea of kitties and puppies (herding puppies no less) running all over this place is enough to give her the vapors. And who won the betting pools? Gotta go look that one up. After the search for the aspirin is done.....
Funny how one starts off in one direction and with nothing more than a phone call, it all changes. What started off as a lazy morning with no direction other than a shower, has turned into something sad. I have an online friend, a lady I met online about, oh gosh, back when Prodigy had their bulletin boards. We have been friends ever since. I can not tell you how near and dear she is to me. Through the years she has always been there, always watching over me. She lives in Texas, she's nurse. She is one of the most caring, loving people I know. She's a writer and writes for one of the genres that I also write in. I finally got to meet this lovely woman almost a year ago. It was wonderful. She is wonderful, as I always knew she would be. She has been through her lot of ups and downs and we're both Aquarians so I think we understand each other better and often without words. Our differences are that she's a better person than I am or could ever hope to be and that's not just me waxing poetic either. It simply is. Over the years, she has called me, just to say hello and that usually tells me she was thinking of me. She never expects anything in return. In truth, I would have called her back many times and either I got busy and it got too late or I can't remember her schedule. It's always her calling me and that always makes me feel bad. Today, she called me. My phone in the bedroom wasn't working and by the time I rushed to the livingroom, she had hung up. When I heard the message on the answering machine, I knew something was up. She never asks me to call her back. I did. Immediately. Her father passed away this morning. She needed me to contact a mutual dear friend for her and it was a done deal. There's not much I wouldn't do for her. She has my shoulder and my ear, anytime she needs it, no matter the time or day. I know she'll take me up on it if she needs to. Even if she doesn't need me, she knows I am here for her. Losing a parent is unlike anything I have ever been through. I have seen my share, been through my share of deaths, but when it comes to a parent, it leaves you in a place of no comparison. So, today, I will light a candle for her, her dad, and her family. Today, my heart is somber and sore because she is hurting so and trying to be strong for everyone, including herself. I love her dearly and I wish I could heal her of this pain and know I can not, only Time can do that. She is a strong woman, with strong and deep spiritual convictions. She understands Life and its cycles. She will come through this and she will be okay. But for right now, she is a daughter, mourning the loss of her dad. May his crossing be a gentle, warm, loving one. May she feel the love and strength those who care for her offer up for her use. May the Lady comfort them all....
It seems to be shaping up into an easy, quiet, vegetative day. The most energy I have expended so far was to wash the shelties. I have been mentally deciding if I should do some writing while I have the chance, but currently, I am role playing in Camelot. Camelot... that brings to mind a few other things. The channel is a good one. We are not strict as most role playing channels, out of character chatter is acceptable so long as it does not become a nuisance while others are role playing. When events can lead to a large crowd or just merely a joyful time, everyone has a great time. It is damn near impossible and totally unreasonable to expect we can keep such times always happening. What I can't lay my finger on is in between times and why there isn't a constant flow of role play. One of the things that stands out is the lack of a general storyline for the channel. I also think some people are not sure about joining in on something for fear of putting their foot in wrong. That fear could easily be relieved by asking questions in private to the one who started the line before posting to the general public. Another problem is that most times, it falls to one or two individuals to start some sort of storyline. I still think that Camelot needs a core of writers, people who would draw up outlines of plots for the channel. Then it could be tossed out for others to join in. That way it would not fall to just one or two. There is always writers' block and burnout to consider, but I can not help but think a core of writers would help relieve that. This, a clique, does not make, but merely a base from which to draw from for the enrichment and furtherment of the channel. Others can be added to the core lot from time to time as needed. It may seem contrived, but I don't believe it would interfere with the free form style we endorse. It would not mean that this core of writers would have to constantly come up with some sort of plot for the channel. I would think it sufficient to divide the year up and come up with a few plots for the year. In the interim, others could work it into their own individual storylines or not, as they so choose. I do think the channel needs more than just a general guideline for behavior and channel rules. Individual storylines are always encouraged, but I think to draw the channel in, to make it feel 'whole', there is a need for something that would call for channel involvement. Okay, I have officially gone brain dead, of course, someone could be cell sucking *ahem*
Wow. It's Friday again. The week, to me, seems to have flown by. I notice that more and more the older I get. Time is flying by. Funny how it seems to take forever to turn twenty-one and then feels like it's in a stall somewhere around thirty something and by my mid-forties, *zoom*. Now, I have to say here, there still are weeks or even months that seem to dig their toes in the dirt and just drag on through, but those times seem to be getting less frequent. The kids seem to be settling into their place. They're taking their time with the unpacking. The grandchildren seem to be acting up a bit, but then their routine has been interrupted. I have to caution the daughter so she doesn't try to velcro them to the wall. The Grove, more fondly known as "The Zoo" is well. Other than the last two rough weeks of barking and growling at each other, we're headed into the Fourth of July weekend quite pleasantly. Now, you all know that is like quicksilver and can change on a whim. I am keeping my baseball bat within arm's length. The Sprout has just come through a mild case of food poisoning. He must be feeling better, he's been giving me loving grief since he came home from work. Of course not having to sit on a pillow seems to help his winning dispostion *snort*. Troll is anxiously awaiting for the arrival of tomorrow. Apparently his Distrtict Manager is headed up from Sacramento. Troll's General Manager seems to think he's getting the axe tomorrow, meaning the GM not Troll, btw. I do not feel sorry for the GM at all. Anything that happens to the GM, he brought on himself. It's been a long time coming. The GM has been getting away with so much crap it's unbelieveable. Where does Troll fit into all this? We haven't got the slightest clue. Troll is one of the Asst. Managers and the DM asked if Troll was going to be working tomorrow, which the answer was an affirmative. I guess we will have to wait until tomorrow to find out what goes down. No one knows when the DM is coming up either. The last thing Troll said to me before leaving for work today was, "If the DM shows up early (like 8am early) that will not be a good thing." Troll doesn't think his job is on the line at all, but with the DM in a bad mood all week, one just can't be too sure about anything. The hubby had to step up to the plate and take over being Captain for the District Veterans Honor Guard, at least until they get everything straightened out. The former captain just upped and quit. I warned the hubby that if this new job stresses him out or affects his health in any way, it's over. Period. As for me, the little mushroom, my days are intermingled with good and exhausted. I know I need to make some time for me alone. I can feel it. I am starting to feel more and more isolated and that isn't good. I have rolled with the punches these past few weeks and they have taken their toll. I'm just not sure how to go about what needs to be done or how to get from this point to the one I need to be at. Family is everything to me, but I need some seclusion, to regenerate. I also need to find some way to reconnect with a certain part of myself that I've seem to misplaced or lost.... that part... I am not so sure I'll find.....
This blog probably won't be of much interest to anyone but myself. Writing it out helps put some things into perspective for me. This has to do with role playing online. I have two references here, one is Camelot, medieval role playing in times beyond King Arthur and the second being, Double Moon, an erotic role playing venue. While Double Moon has an online channel, it's seldom used. I think the time factor and real life have a way of crunching it, but we make up for it via our Yahoo Email Group. I have to say that Double Moon (or DM for short) seems to run fairly well and easily. There is seldom any problem staying within the guidelines that my partner and I have set. When trouble does poke its little nose out, one of us, if not both, roll up a newspaper and smack it. Things settle back in. Over the years, behind the scenes, there have been some growlings, but out of the ears and eyes of us both. Word gets around, I usually find out things. I think the most satisfying thing for me is to provide such a safe and guarded playground for other of like mind to play in. Now and then, my partner and I drop in but we feel no obligation to do so. The list runs itself for the most part and is productive. I just wish I could get a handle on Camelot's problem. I have been there long enough to qualify as an 'old timer'now, not as 'old' as some, but old enough. Camelot has been accused of having cliques. I can see where it appears that way, but I don't believe it to be true. Like minds attract. Some people are born idea people, some are support, some are action. In business management, we use what each person is good at to the best advantage of the company. I see the channel like that. Some people can create a great storyline, some are better at being supportive or feeding the storyline and some people can take an idea and kick it off the ground. In this case, it seems as if it all falls upon the same shoulders all the time. There also has to be those who keep things in line and focused so plots don't go off the deep end somewhere. Maybe part of the problem is the lack of definite lines. Someone has to draw a line in the dirt and say, " This is the line. It doesn't get crossed. Period. " The lines are not open to negotiation or interpretation. In a channel, such as Camelot, it was created by a single person's vision. One can not please all the people all the time. The internet is a broad and vast place. If someone doesn't see something in the same manner or fashion, there is no reason why they can't go off and create their own utopia. This one channel is representative of a single vision, shared by like minds, not minds that can step in and change it to their interpretation or even tweak it to make them comfortable. We have made concessions. We have blurred the lines. Now, there is confusion and chaos. To fix it would take a major overhaul and cause hurtful feelings among some because they have been allowed to play to their whim. Where does it stop? When some get fed up? Do we pick up our toys and disappear? Do we turn the channel over? Or do we stop the nonsense? Do we clean house and begin again? Yes, there is a point when we all have to learn to get along and play nicely together or at least remain civil and play through. When do we stop the actions of a person because they're driving others bonko? When do we say, listen, your character is out of control, reign it in or there's the door? When do we know we have a problem? When more than one person has the same complaint seems logical to me. When do the feelings of one person override the good of the channel? And who has the balls to do anything about it? Is anyone above all this? Yeah. I'd have to say so. Founders. It is their vision, their channel. If I need to get my little arse bent over someone's knee and whalloped for being out of line, so be it. I can't read minds. I can't know if I crossed a line unless someone tells me so. Then I have a choice to make, either I can tow the line or get out. Because Camelot attracts many diiferent people, it takes a diligent, strong effort to keep Her on subject, in vision. Without that strength, there is chaos and loss of interest. The channel is not a democracy nor does it belong to everyone. It is a gentle dictatorship and belongs to those who founded it. If you can't find what you're looking for, feel free to take your own vision and start something anew. Build it and someone may come... just leave our playground the way you found it.
When my husband was diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer two years ago, I felt like the rug had been jerked out from under me. My world became, at most, shaky. I went numb for a few days. I said all the right things, gave all the right encouragements, behaved in a 'normal' manner. Inside, I was scared. I didn't want to lose this man that had taken me a lifetime to find. I didn't want to lose the security I had come to know and appreciate. I didn't want the lives of my loved ones turned upside down yet again. The thought of what he and I would have to face, terrified me. I knew I couldn't lose it. I knew I had to be strong and be a constant reminder to him of the things worth fighting and living for and that together, no matter what the odds were to become, we would do it together. In the course of our relationship there have been times I wanted to choke the living daylights out of him and I'm sure those times are not over yet. He is one of the most giving, loving, caring human beings I know in this world. He has his faults and his problems, so do I, yet we persevere. We've never truly had a 'fight'. We have growled at each other. We have watched the other blow a cork now and then but all in all, there is the love that binds us. During times of stress, my children have been wonderful. They have pitched in and done what needed to be done so that I might devote my attention to the situation at hand. During these times those handful I call truly friends have been there for me to lean on, to draw strength from, to make me laugh and forget my worries at least for a moment or two. I am truly blessed. In the last two years, as each test comes back positively, my world gets less shakier and I can feel that rug inching back under my feet again. Today went a long way to restoring those things as well. Today marked the beginning of the third year and his colonoscopy came back clear. The doctor told me that he doesn't believe the cancer will ever come back. I do thank him for that. Does that mean I will be less diligent in my observations of my husband's daily routines? No. Cancer is a rotting, canker sore that raises its ugly head whenever it damn well pleases and to hell with the people it brings pain to. Does it mean I will relax a little now, thank the Lady for the blessing bestowed upon me and enjoy more what is set before me each day? Yes. I can never dismiss cancer, because when it dismisses us, someone has left an aching gap in the life of another. One day two years ago, cancer knocked on our door and we had no choice but to answer it. Today, it no longer lingers here, but I see its shadow out there. I'll be watching.
Oh mercy, what day is this? Monday if my calendar isn't lying. Mercury in retrograde. Oh goody. That's sarcasm for those who don't perceive it. If this past weekend is any indication of the ride I need to see out, it's not a pith helmet I need and a deeper foxhole isn't going to help either. I'm leaning toward a stout rope with a big fatty knot on the end, one big enough to sit on and wait out this retrograde. *sigh* Saturday. Most of the day I was truly a 'shroom, given my Friday, that would be understandable. Saturday evening and part of the early morning of Sunday, Mr. Mushy and I got into it. Needless to say, I did not find myself calm enough to sleep until around 5 am. Sunday dawned way too early for me and we were due over at daughter's house to take care of a few things for her, boxes to go into storage (oh yea, because FB will take forever to get around to it), curtains to hang (we won't go there) and to just spend a wee bit of time with the babies since they haven't gotten to come over until today that is. I had calmed down by Sunday morning, but upset was still my middle name, that is unusual since I seldom ever carry anything of that sort over to the next day. It would serve no purpose. Today is Monday and there is still a purpose, but not the emotion that was raised. You have seen me write the word 'drained' more times than I like. Yet, there is no other word that seems to fit how I feel at this moment. Still, tomorrow will come and I will do what needs to be done because it must be and some small part of my mind will whisper, "How much more?" Someone very close to me once said, " You just need to be cuddled. " I'll second that.
Thomas, thanks for re-sending the invitation... I'm doing a poem, not sure if I'm gonna do Robert Frost, though. He doesn't really have a particular style. Some poems he does 10 syllables per line, some 9, some 7, etc... But then, I could just combine elements of all of his poems... If I was doing one of the essays, though, I would do the Robert Frost one. It seems easier than all of the rest.
Hey Everyone: IS EVERYBODY EITHER DOING A POEM OR DOING THE ESSAY THAT TALKS ABOUT ROBERT FROST? Anybody doing any essay prompt besides that? or I'm just such an outcast that I can find not a single accomplice to share ideas with
Hello Hello Hello, What did all of you people discuss about Robert Frost today? Any interesting interpretation and revelations, anything important things I missed today?.......
It wasn't too shabby. But it was all about the Ralph Wiggum quotes! "Me fail English? That's unpossible!"
Hey how did everyone think of that really "interesting hands on" activity we did on "CELEBRATION?" I guess it was a really powerful activity for our class (third period) to get all the people engaged. I celebrate the fact that we don't have to do that activity every day, only a little change for one day.
To me it seems like Whitman's going on a "poetic rant" of sorts on his thoughts of life, love, happiness, etc. He's not necessarily praising himself as much as he's just praising his life in general. Man, I could sure use a fat bag of the crack he was smoking right now... ;-)
hey everyone, does anybody know what Whitman is talking about in his Poetry??????
Heh sorry Beck it's too late now. It will be helpful if we knew what you were reading. Onto the new poetry "Songs of Myself", would anybody want to share their general impression or interpretation of what the poem is about?
Hello hello. Anyone want to do my Wread like a Writer for me? Oh well.
I sent the blog invitation out to everyone. So please check your email to accept the blog invitation. As of 2/12/04: These are the people who have accepted the invitation and are currently a blog member: Thomas Chen, Chad Wyszinski, Erin Riley, Kimber Graef, Corey Furin, Matt Goosen, and Tyson Cecka.
Hey everyone, this is a test to see if it works. If any of you have suggestions, i can change the templates and settings to suit everyone. Also, does anyone have any good AP English or literature links I can put up on the website?
I have to say that I'm not as interested in reading Night because I read it in eighth grade and it is a very emotional book that I would prefer to read once only because it is so sad. However since it seems curriculum here is different and students here haven't yet read it, I suppose that's unfair of me. I'll read it again if I have to.
-Hello AP English, this is Ryan Elliott and I'm a rookie to Blogger.com. I recall reading Night freshman year in Mrs. Micheel's English class, and the impression the story left on me brings to mind the narratives of Fredderick Douglas and Harriet Jacobs. The accounts of the Holocaust enable the reader to experience the horror firsthand, and each individual number in the death totals suddenly forms a face. At the beginning of the year I remember Mrs. VA stressing the importance of showing and not telling in writing, and I feel in many cases that history can tell a story, but it takes a first person account like Night or the narratives of Douglas and Jacobs to show the reader a story and make them live it. Considering the current study of World War II in AP History, I think Night would be an excellent compliment. The present study of World War II with Ms. Clark has made me feel disappointed in American diplomacy because of the decision to drop atom bombs on two Japanese cities. When encountering the situation, I pretended I was a soldier in WWII, and I tried to think of how I would have felt about our actions. Not only am I shocked at the civilian aimed tactics implemented globally during the war, but also I am troubled by America's decision to take part. Personally, I would have difficulty enlisting in the military because of the possibility that I could be asked to carry out a mission like the one presented to Paul Tibbets, the pilot of the Enola Gay. I believe war is a conflict between armed military soldiers, and does not involve intentional civilian casualties. In today's military this death count is accounted for by the term collateral damage, which masks its true definition probably for the morale of soldiers and the maintenance public relations. I can't imagine I would feel at peace pledging allegiance to a nation who was engaging in civilian warfare. I love my country and would no doubt serve if conscripted; however, I feel the line in the pledge of allegiance, "with liberty and justice for all" extends to all people of the world, and that the American bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were injustices to the Japanese people. I believe pledging allegiance to the United States of America means promising one's devotion to preserve the liberty and justice of our nation while attempting to extend the basic courtesies to all who we come in contact with. The invisible borders separating the people of the world are self created illusions, much like the concept of racial differences, that do nothing to obscure the sanctity of democratic rights or our responsibility to uphold them.
YES I'M VERY MUCH INTERESTED! To me, historical literature are especially fun to read, especially when it compliments with what we are studying in history. And the holocaust is certainly a dramatic period of history and literture that would sprout out many ideas about morality, wars, politics and the whole theme of race and injustices. I may not be able to speak for the whole class, but it's certainly a great topic to discuss and read about! I'm sure Tristan would be interested in it too! :) And well, since Rob, you've started the pledge of allegiance debate, I have already posted a huge long post about the pledge in the history blog, but I think it's relevant for me to post my argument on this blog too because it touches on the issue of individualism and what is to be an American (the whole themes we've studied all year). And don't blame me for writing about this thing for so long, but it is inevitable. Of course everyone knows that the 1st Amendments guarantees "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.......". And then one can debate FOREVER what does that mean, either pro pledge of allegiance, the under God phrase, or opposes it. Either way, both sides can site the constitution to argue for their sides. LOL that's the beauty of our first amendment, even tho it may be concise, it's still very interpretative. And the society is sooooooooo complex that a few words in the constitution can be argued forever into future generations. As a former buddhist, and currently agnostic, to me personally, the "Under God" phrase doesn't offend me. But the act of conforming is. I have nothing against people saying or chanting Under God at anytime, anywhere, or under any occassion; the constitution guarantees their rights to do so. The thing that bothers me is the act of telling others what to do or not to do. How does that relate to the pledge of allegiance is the fact that little kid six years old have to say the pledge of allegiance. And did you know all the MEANING of the words in the pledge of allegiance when you were six? To me it's almost ridiculous to impose others to say what they don't even know what they are saying, and what it means......let alone believes in it. So the little kids just memorize the phrase and spew it out like robots. And that's not what America is all about..... What makes America great and the beauty of this country is the fact that it's a country of immigrants, and EVERBODY is different, and the constitution really protects the DIFFERENCE of all individuals. In fact, individualism is not only protected, but glorified and encouraged all throughout American literature from the declaration of independence and onwards. And from individualism comes with it, differences of ideas, clash of cultures, criticisms, and sometimes stuff that people don't want to hear. What bothers me is when people stop wanting to hear complaints and other points of views. Any criticism, or other radical ideas becomes BAD and immediately shuts off from debates........And everybody has to praise everybody, praise the government, praise all the institutions, all the ideas and so on. And even if you don't, you are somehow peer pressured, or forced to comply with the "majority" point of view. Some of America's greatest writers were critics of the time, and often deemed radicals because of their foiling of the truth......truth that the majority didn't want to admit. Like Mark Twain's Huck Finn realism style writing that foils the true life of the South from a common southern white orphan boy's point of view. (Of course it's not just happy little child pacifer literature that's all happy and good. Because the society isn't always that good). Seriously think about, what a society would be like if everyone is the same, think the same way, and all are happy with each other with no reason. Everybody would just lose their personality and the society itself will become dumber. And education is really when the clash between conformity and individualism occurs. In order to preserve the individualisms as America's embodiment, I believe that in schools, since it's a public place, the state or government should have no say in what the kids should say. The kids are just kids, they are learning and developing.........And wheh pledge of allegiance is inserted to thehir curriculum since their first day in school.....And have memorize something they don't even know what it is......it totally defeats the American character. Education is to develop people to become individuals, to become smart citizens with an critical eye, and not to turn everybody into robotic conformists. And as always, I welcome all dissagreements, criticisms, opinions and would like to debate this issue with others. Differences of opinions is good! Thomas Chen
Hmmm...I'm starting to think ahead to curriculum after spring break, when we will have time to read another book and also to prepare for the AP exam. I know from talking with Miss Clark that her classes have recently been spending time studying the Holocaust, and I'm thinking about Kailie's expression of frustration. Why didn't Jim just run? A similar question is often, "Why didn't the Jews just band together and keep the Nazis from treating them so poorly." I'm wondering...are you folks interested in reading a first-hand account of Auschwitz after break? The book I'm thinking of is Night, written beautifully by Elie Wiesel. It's a quick read, but it's also a hard read because of the subject matter. It isn't American lit (Wiesel was Romanian, I believe), but that doesn't really matter for the test. What do you all think? Would it be best to be presented with a variety of options before deciding? As for your question about the Pledge of Allegiance, Rob...I find myself asking many more questions in addition to the one about the "under God" phrase. For example, what does it mean to pledge allegiance to a flag at a time when patriotism is so integrated with war-making? I cannot help but remember photos I've seen of Nazi swastika flags hanging over church altars during World War II. As a religious person, I want to see a full separation of church and state so that I am left to practice my faith as I see fit. I believe others have that right, too. Although I believe that we exist by the grace of God, not everyone does. So what does our flag stand for? When we pledge allegiance to it, what are we promising to do or not do? What is the role of God in a pluralistic country? What binds us together as a people, particularly as we become a more diverse society every year? Does pledging allegiance mean committing ourselves to creative peace-making, or only that we will pick up arms if attacked? And what about "justice for all"? These are the questions I ask myself every day at the beginning of third period. What do you all think? Mrs. V-A
First of all, let me start off by saying that I have no problem with mandatory repetition of the Pledge of Allegiance because it stands for becoming INDIVISIBLE in an effort against conformity...promotes LIBERTY- the liberty to think, act, and live without government intervention...as well as JUSTICE FOR ALL- the permission for everyone to live as they please. It may be ironic that there is a uniform method of promoting the liberties that lead to diversity, but if everyone is made different through the same process, are they not still different? I recognize the recitation of the Pledge alludes to military service as flags are used to determine a soldier's allegiance in war, but I also believe that the Pledge is more effective with a visual aid. The debate today is whether or not "under GOD" should or even COULD be allowed to stay in the Pledge. I outlined the current particulars of today's case in a previous post, if you haven't read them. To me, this is a case defining the separation of church and state. Although this country was outlined around that seperation, there is nothing that states that government can't recognize the ideology of monotheism, or other belief structure, as long as it doesn't allow the government of religion to directly affect it. One could argue that excluding the possibility of a deity's existence would be not seperating the state from atheist ideology. Tom C addressed free speach...that each American has the right to say what they want and worship as they please. With compliments to that right, many Americans feel the direct connection between Providence and the success of this country, and that excluding their right to express His influence in relation to the country would antithesize their beliefs. The same issue is currently being presented in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, as an Atheist man argues that with each (socially) mandatory oration of the Pledge, his daughter is taught that her father's beliefs are the wrong ones. As for me, I believe that eliminating it from the Pledge restricts the large portion of Americans who recognize the Glory of God as parallel with the liberties of this country. For those who are polytheistic, "under god" can be translated as recognizing a "higher power" than is visible in daily life. Lastly, for those that don't recognize any supernatural force or deity, "under God" may be substituted with a respectful pause while those who do choose to recognize God do so. My views have been presented, but I'm all about becoming as educated as I can on the attitudes toward the aspects of life that effect the way we live every day... so school me! If "Night" is a good read, then I'm all for it...especially if it's short! Also, are Rip Van Winkle, The Grapes of Wrath, or The Catcher in the Rye worth reading over break? Because they all spark my interest. Have a great break, and the fabulous assembly ASB will be presenting Friday morning. Love, Rob
In response to Kailie, I think your point about how Jim's not afraid of enduring through all of these ridiculous rituals imposed by Tom (If I interpreted you correctly), illustrates Jim's complex charactor and heroic quality. Jim, as a slave, probably has a really low self-esteem and he comes from the world where slaves have to listen to whites for every little nuts and bolts. Of course Jim did not know he was free, (any slave would think it's a miracle if somebody proclaimed they were free). So he just thought "this is the way everything is done, because Tom said so". Even though he has the brain to mention it's a ridiculous idea like making up a coat of arm, but he still follows the order, because who knows what will happen to him if a slave doesnt obey a white man's order. But I understand where you come from. I also felt very weird these things were happening, but lots of weird things happen back then, a lot of things today would consider very very sick and unbearble......So in trusting Twain's realism style of writing, I have to just interpret what I can about the society from Twain's words.
I was really frustrated when reading the end of the book when Tom and Huck were "rescuing" Jim. I couldn't help but get past the idea that, if Jim were really worried about getting away from slavery and afraid for his life, he wouldn't jump through all the hoops for Tom's perfect scheme. I felt it was a little unrealistic; it's natural instinct to run when given the chance -- just like if a dog were to get free, he wouldn't sit around and wait for the perfect getaway. He'd just get out of there! Did anyone else feel anxious while reading this part in the book, or is it just me?
Wowzers. I'm on the blog! Cool.......Thanks for the blog Thomas. Anywho, hope this can be a good spot to swap thoughts. Adios and God bless. Yeehawman (Tristan)
Knowing what Jim had to go through and then at the end for him to just give it all up for the sake of Tom, proves Jim to be the more significant hero. Throughout their whole journey Jim was always worried about Huck and concentrated on his friendship with Huck. Whenever they were separted Jim would search forever for Huck until he found where he was. They always ended up reuniting due mostly to Jim's love for Huck. Not until the end of the book did Huck ever truly try to find Jim. However at the end of the book Huck's love for Jim became more prevelant. Although Huck knew better than to do all the crazy things that Tom insisted they do in order to free Jim, somehow Huck's love for Jim was submissive to Tom's influence over Huck. After trying so hard to escape to freedom then putting up with Tom's ideas of freeing a slave, Jim was still willing to risk it all for the sake of saving Tom. This is what a true hero is. Huck didn't have anything to lose, if people found out he had been trying to free a slave they would send him back to the widow's house and people would just think "that poor boy needs to be civilized." However for Jim, he had everything to lose, and he was willing to lose everything for Tom, who wasn't even a true friend to Jim.
While both Huck and Jim can be seen as heroes, Jim is the more siginificant hero of the two because of not only the racism he faces by being a slave, but because he can overcome this racism by saving Tom in the end of the book. In Tom's cruel and "adventurous" plan to help Jim escape to freedom puts Jim in a place where he is locked in a cabin, when he could be free. Jim doesn't object to this plan because he figures that Tom is white and thus knows what he is doing. After putting Jim through a month of being locked up, Tom does manage to help Jim escape.(even though Tom is shot in the leg) This is the point that seperates Jim's heroism from Huck's.....Jim throws away the freedom that he has endured a month's "cabin fever" for to save Tom that has just put him through this month of isolation.
In my opinion, Huck and Jim are both heros in this novel. Huck is a hero in a sense that he decides to go to hell to save Jim, which was a huge decision to make at such a time in the South. Later in the novel, Jim becomes the hero when he sacrifices his freedom (or so he thinks), the freedom that Huck has worked to protect, to save Tom's life. Both Huck and Jim have their heroic moments by making huge moral decisions. They both have to decide whether or not to do the right thing, and the fact that they both end up doing what's right makes them both heros. Sorry, that made no sense...talking about stuff like this confuses me sometimes; I know what I want to say, but it just doesn't come out right!
Ok.......Everyone......We now have reached the 20th person mark with Rob Muilenburge being the 20th blog member (although probably the 5th person who's published anything on this blog). Oh yeah, If any of you have trouble finding your latest written post on the web, it's because you did not published it; it's only saved ready to publish. So you have to click on one of the icons on top you'll see that says "publishing", and click on "republish latest". Then you will see your nice happy post on the web.........I'm not sure if there are some remote posts posted by people long long time ago that never got onto the website because somebody didn't publish it...........yeah so be sure to remember to publish everytime you write a post......And enjoy everyone. wow, what a well constructed argument there Rob.......Now there has commenced a real discussion. Yeah I'll get back to your comments soon on a later post.
Hey guys, you can add one more to the total # of bloggers, making 19 i think? Anyway, addressing Tom's point from the essay that Twain was writing for a racist audience doesn't sit well with me. I'm not disagreeing that there were (and still are) many racists in this country, and probably some of them were fans of the original, Tom Sawyer, but I just don't get the feeling Twain wrote for an audience. He was already a very successful author who had stopped needing to write for money, so I don't think the bottom line was his issue. Every example of Twain's writing I've come across challenges cultural norms. Whether addressing Christianity, poverty, or racism, he attacks each issue with the underestimated weapon of satire. Flooding the tongue-in-cheek essays and novels with his own opinions, no matter how controversial. I don't believe that Twain could be writing for a racist audience while openly attacking the Ku Klux Klan, and the entire establishment of Christianity. If Twain avoided openly expressing Huck's love for Jim to the world, it was to get around his own nagging imperfections in his relations with blacks. I don't believe that this was as much of a concious effort as Miss Morison claims. Sometimes things are better off left to the imagination, e.g. the "humbles himself to a nigger" sentence is much more effective in my eyes than, "I'm sorry Jim, I didn't mean to worry you." Lastly, although Morison's essay was very well articulated and worthy of consideration, it was very much speculation, just as I am writing now. I look forward to posting often and lengthily in this blog, so you've been warned. By the way, the appeal to the removing "under god" from the pledge of allegiance began this week. I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on that, as well as on Huck and the recent essay. Love, Rob
Hello! My assumption is that extra credit will motivate many of you to access this site this weekend, so I thought I would throw out some questions we didn't have time for in class. Who is the hero of the novel? Huck or Jim? What are the most significant themes from the book that affected you personally? What about Toni Morrison's question: "Yet the larger question, the danger that sifts fr om the novel's last page, si whether Huck, minus Jim, will be able to stay those three monsters as he enters the 'territory.' Will that undefined space, so falsely imagined as "open," be free of social chaos, personal morbidity, and further moral complications embedded in adulthood and citizenship? Will it be free not only of nightmare fathers but of dream fathers too?" Have fun! Remember to study for Monday's test. :-) Mrs. V-A
HA....What I found so interested while reading through this essay was the fact that even tho Mark Twain might be a staunch abolitionists....For racial equality during that time period........But he also has to sell the book, make the book noteworthy.....And so Twain has to insert a lot of audience-awareness into his novel.......And since he knows a lot of the readers at the time are rascists......Therefore he makes Huck sometimes very uneasy to comment how good Jim is......Even tho Huck probably knows deep inside that Jim is a very good person......But he fails to admit it to anybody else........Even fail to admit fully to Jim and himself Huck's true feelings. And of course Twain probably didn't know the future status of blacks/slaves, and all is very uncertain........So he had no choice but to retain some of the old stereotypical qualities.........Only today can we see it from an objective point of view.
Don't blame me everyone..........but i've just thought of a great idea to implement for this blog......There are those "Open-ended" free response questions in the AP English exam (usually one a year), that has an open prompt and one has to write a mini expository essay about it, from your own experience. And last year's was: urlLink "entertainment has the capacity to ruin society" , defend, challenge, or qualify this assertion. Soooooooooo any cool ideas/agree/dissagree viewpoints on this statement.
*crickets chirping* So, to break the silence: If you/Huck Finn/your milieu/a good heart and corrupt conscience/a stereotype were a hot dog . . .
Ok, WOWWWWWWWWW NOBODY HAS BEEN USING THE BLOG FOR SOOOOOOOOOO LONG............WHAT AN EERIE SILENCE HERE..........I'M GONNA HAVE TO RENAME THIS BLOG "DEAD BLOG" NOW..........

hey thomas, thanks for re-inviting me! and i totally think that we had a really great class discussion, though it would be nice to get everyone involved. some people are still pretty quiet.
It was an astounding discussion today! I'm surprised at our third period class today, we actually did some genuine discussions! Without more than five minutes of silent stares at each other! That's a huge benchmark for us. LOL. Ok Nova, we may have a different stance on this issue about the discussion of "racism". I think the controversy of it is really really interesting, and really relevant to the society we live in today. Maybe whining about it doesn't help, and only makes the matter worse. But one has to study the history behind racism, the history behind slavery, and study the current society in general to get all these controversies and see that these debates are very interesting. If we are living in a place like Chicago, Los Angeles, NYC, San Francisco, or Atlanta, we might see the issue and controversies surrounding the issues of race and racism in a very different way, because the societies of these urban centers are so polygot that you CANNOT ignore the issue of race at all. And it becomes so relevant to your everyday lives, whether you like it or not. So I don't think we can make a judgement on how the issue of "racism" is sooooo out of date and dumb now. To a lot of people, it's very relevant to their lives. And reading this book Huck Finn I'm sure will help us understand better the deep history behind slavery, race relationships between whites and blacks, that still influences our thinkings today. And I agree with today's discussion just banning the N word will not solve any any racial problem at all, not even down to the scale of molecules. There are a lot of other forms of racial discriminatory actions that we can not ban because of free speech issue such as Erin's description of all the confederate flags in the south still. And for christ's sake it's a piece of literature, one of the best pieces of American lit every written. And to the issue of calling people "whites", "blacks", "African Americans" whatever, I agree with the discussions today that it's a matter of respect. Some people maybe offended by calling "black", others maybe "African Americans", so it. But I agree that in general, we just have to see all people as one group of Americans, and not place any body into a race or cultural profile. --------- So, what do you think of that?
The entire racism argument makes me mad. Do people not get that Twain was anti-racist? That he was trying to make a statement with Huck Finn? And also, the "n-word" was used back then, and it was the common word for black people. Making all the poor white people of the south talk in a more socially polite way would have been defeating a major point of the book, realism. 100 years from now, what if "black" is not politically correct? Will they ban all the books written in present day, to censor "bad words"? These people make me so mad!!!
I think the people who are against this book for its portrayl of blacks need to look at how it shows whites. It shows cruel whites, white drunks, white racists, whites who steal, lie, cheat... so how does Mark Twain show black people in a negative light, when the majority of his criticisms are demonstrated through his white characters?
I think we should have a discussion on Huck Finn and the controversy, it seems very interesting. I read this particular interesting thing in the passage that implied you need to be a "good teacher" , to actually use all the positive aspects of Huck Finn and teach more about the truth of slavery. One needs to teach Huck Finn in conjuction to the historical period behind it. An "insensitive teacher" may allow the racial impacts the word has on the students in the classroom goes unchecked, and allow students to "read aloud" in the classrooms. But "on the contrary, studies have shown that, in the hands of a good teacher, the novel can actually have a positive impact on racial attitudes and increase in interracial understanding. I agree with the fact that if you don't see the true picture of that period in history, to see the life of a "common man", and use the language they use back then, one can not grasp a true concept of. And of course all of this have to be carefully studied in conjuction to a great understanding of the history of slavery and slave trading. That's why having the book in elementary and middle school is probably not a good idea. Because the kids then can't get ironies, satires, and the historical behind why Twain wrote this book and used the bad words to portrait the truth.
Well, I would have gotten the first question right... Anyway, Natalya, Tom suggested I talk to you about taking his place in the district MUN coming up in May. I have the basic understanding of what goes on, but if you would like me to join you, you can e-mail at attakid117@attbi.com or call me at 574-1916 with info (specifically what I would need to do to prepare). Hope to hear from you soon... And to everyone else, Good Luck Monday! Love, Rob
Sorry, but I had to post this poem I found in one of the practice tests I have been taking. I really like this test because of the fact that a lot of the experts that they give for analysis are actually really interesting to interpret and are great works of literature: Virtue George Herbert (1593-1633) Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright, The bridal of the earth and sky; The dew shall weep thy fall tonight; For thou must dies. Sweet rose, whose hue, angry and brave, Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye: Thy root is ever in its grave, And thou must die. Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses, A box where sweets compacted lie; My music shows ye have your closes, And all must die. Only a sweet and virtuous soul, Like seasoned timber, never gives; But though the whole world turn to coal, Then chiefly lives. Just a couple of questions for practice:) The subject of the poem is: a) mortality, b) immortality, c) the beauty of nature, d) the impact of evil, e) the essence of goodness. The speaker conceives of the world as: a) ending in ashes, b) repeating the cycle of birth and death, c) having the strength of "seasoned timber," d) eternal, e) being the secure dwelling of humanity I am looking forward to frisbee tomorrow; I have to agree with Frank that sometimes it is just better to simply relax and take your mind off all the fidgeting and worries. By the way the answers to the questions are: e and c.
All this death and gloom over the AP test, we all need some happiness... Well, okay, i'm no good at being happy, so here is some dark sarcasm. Good enough? Bush To Iraqi Militants: 'Please Stop Bringing It On' WASHINGTON, DC—In an internationally televised statement Monday, President Bush modified a July 2003 challenge to Iraqi militants attacking U.S. forces. "Terrorists, Saddam loyalists, and anti-American insurgents: Please stop bringing it on now," Bush said at a Monday press conference. "Nine months and 500 U.S. casualties ago, I may have invited y'all to bring it on, but as of today, I formally rescind that statement. I would officially like for you to step back." The president added that the "it" Iraqis should stop bringing includes gunfire, bombings, grenade attacks, and suicide missions of all types. Props to the Onion for that little piece. My two cents on the AP test? AHHHHH. Now, were did all those grammar/rhetorical thingy lists go to? --Beck--
I just took the collegeboard test and I have to agree that it is much, much easier than the one we took in class, at least my score went up by 10 points:) I agree that literary terms are crucial to know both for mult. choice and essays, but grammer is also really important, they have a few questions like: lines ... contain which of the following?: a) elaborate metaphor b) parallel syntax c) a single periodic sentence d) a compound subject e) subordinate clauses I am currently looking through all the grammer packets Mrs. VA gave us in the beginning of the year. Yeah, I am kind of starting to feel a bit nervous already. P.S. The evil that men do lives after them, the good is oft intered with their bones. (not sure if that's how it goes:)
Friends, English Classmen, lend me your ears. It is true what you say... the test is subjective, subtle, and DIFFICULT. But you are more prepared than you think. By now we can all write 9-caliber essays with the right inspiration, and the multiple choice is less perilous than you give it credit for. The tests we've taken from the books are meant to trick you- beat you on a technicality and so forth. So much so that the objective (I hope) is to get you to read the questions so closely, you don't get fooled on the test. However, there is evidence for hope. The test that I gave a link to in my last post, was a sample test written by the college board... after a 50% on the Peterson's test, I got an 80% on the real one... that's a huge improvement. It's also great for confidence. We can do this, class!!! The best advice I can give is to know the literary terms like the back of your hand... what they are, how they're used, and how you can recognize them in a passage. That's the heart of these questions, and if you can identify those terms, you will have success. Love, Rob
My only suggestion to those who want to "study" for AP English test is to take as many practice multiple choice questions as possible, and after you took a couple hundred of them you will probably see some patterns emerge; at least that's what I am planning on doing for the next 5 days. The only problem that I see is that all the practice tests written either by Petersons or Barrons are much harder and some of the questions are totally different from those on the actual AP test, so if you take their practice tests you will probably get used to those author's patterns of thinking and the type of questions they ask and what answers they are looking for, yet it's still a good practice: it helps you to try and think like the writer of the questions and also pace yourself. Last year I was taking practice world history tests and so at the AP test all the questions seemed much easier to answer and I answered all of them in time. I have to agree though with Thomas that AP English is hard becuase of its subjective questions, I am myself almost never 100% sure on answers, and often those that I was sure of end up being wrong. But I agree with Eren also that essays make up for the harsheness of mult. choice; especially after Mrs. VA gave us the rubric it became much clearer to me what exactly I should focus on including in my essays. So just practice a few more hundred mult. choice questions;), and review grammar and literary terms. My favorite questions on our last practice test: 26. What is the meaning of the word "object" (line 85)? a) Feel b) Dispute c) Argue d) Silence e) Save I think Rob was the one to point out the fact that "dispute" and "argue" are too similar to see that much of a difference between the two.
To be perfectly honest, i dont really see how you can study for the AP test. I mean, of course you can review grammar and rhetorical strategies and how they effect one's writing, but i dont think it's worth getting overly stressed. Be confident in the knowledge you already have; we've all been preparing for this since the first day we signed up for AP -- just do you best. For me, I'm planning on going in on Monday with what I know...that's all we really can do. You know what you know, and as long as you try your best, that's all you can do. So dont stress out too bad. Just think, by noon on Monday, it will all be over! Kailie
I have to disagree Thomas. The AP English test is definitely tough, but I don't think its the toughest. While a lot of the multiple choice questions are subjective, the essays make up for it. If you write good strong essays and support your points, you should (hopefully!) do well. I think people just find the test to be hard because its not something you can memorize out of a book; its skills for recognizing rhetorical strategies and writing well that count.
Ok maybe it's just me, but I would rank AP English tests the hardest tests. The multiple choice questions on the AP English tests are harder than SAT passages (which i already did horribily), not only are we suppose to know the meanings of the passage, but exactly and thoroughly understand how authors wrote it and carefully constructed the passages. There are several reasons for this ranking that puts English on the APEX of all AP tests: 1: The questions are the most subjective: Everytime when I take the AP English multiple choice tests, for every MC, I feel my hands sweat and my mind full of doubt when I bubble in an answer for that question. There is NEVER a single question that I can feel 100% confident on that I'm sure I got it right. Unlike all other subjects, including US history, where there is just some straightfoward concrete fact that's either right or wrong. The meaning of every excerpt, sentence, even to the every word of the question can be interpreted in a variety of different ways. And as Chad mentioned today in class, that we are taught so much about how to infer, imply, that we sometimes forget the LITERAL MEANINGS, and we lose perspectives. In short, every question we can "Overthink" it. And again being the subject of English, there is no fine line as to where is "overthinking", and where is "underthinking". To a point, it gets to be rather annoying, all the shakiness and uncertaintiness in answer EVERY SINGLE QUESTION. 2: When you get an answer wrong, and you read the explanations that explains why, you are never ever 100% convinced. There is always that self-righteous factor that comes to play that doubts the correct answers, simply because words and phrases can be interpreted differently in everybody's minds. Everytime I feel the urge to argue with whoever thought the right answer to a question is this letter, while two other letter of answers can probably be interpreted as correct. 3: For almost every other school subject, the teacher, the student, if he or she is willing to learn or improve, can easily identify the weak areas, which FACTS the student's missing and so on after some assessments......But for English, I just know I'm not prepared for the test, and I know did bad on the practice ones, but still there is not some concrete evidences I can point out that here, this is my weak area, or this I really do not understand. So it becomes a matter of trial and error and practice, which seems limitless and endless. And Finally, this is the most unique about the English test that's different than EVERY OTHER SUBJECT: ---- YOU CAN NOT CRAM AND STUDY FOR . Yeah it is right that after maybe several, maybe several dozens years of intense study.....You maybe say I'm fully prepared now for the AP english exam........And still the questions bombards you with subjectivity. And just the shear size of the vocabulary, the subtle difference between all the synonymous words, (overstatement, hyperbolie, implies, infers, suggests, what is the intent, argue, dispute...). And it's like your whole life of culture and experience in the world culminates and contributes to your performance on this test. Yeah for a really really stressed, miserably failing, troubled, an extremely unprepared and uncertained kid one weekend before he has to take the AP English language test, This test is just not the test to cram for. All in all, AP English test in my feeling is just hard.......harder than every other test. Unless you are Matt Wu of course. I don't know if any of you share any of the feelings I listed above. So there is my emotional turmoil of the day. Thanks all to all of you who were willing to read this. Thomas Chen
Hey, for those of you feeling stressed about the AP test next Monday as a result of some negative test scores on the Peterson's practice we took, there is a College Board written practice at http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_englang.html You may have to download a new Acrobat reader, but this should be a slightly more accurate prediction of your success than the Devil's own instrument of torture; The Peterson Test. Good luck to everyone on this practice test, remember to take it within the alotted time, it is good practice! Love Rob
Thomas, I totally agree with you that standardized tests are simply unfair/wrong since individuals are not standard. It seems like in America everything is about individuality and ability to strive and achieve, yet society still places standards upon us that we have to pass in order to be "good citizens." I'm myself very frustrated with SATs and ACTs cause no matter if I am “super smart,” or get 1st places in competitions, I am just bad in analogies and my vocab doesn't include such words as vituperative, or flabbergasted. I personally just came from the WASMUN competition where I was elected Best Negotiator, and Rapatour (I don't know how to spell that) and spoke in front of 600 "delegates," and yet all of that doesn't matter cause I still feel "not good enough" cause my awesome SAT scores place me into the "average/standard" herd of students. Actually I think it's an awesome idea to encourage our fellow students to participate in conversations by addressing them directly, it really does work... sometimes. In our "committees" in MUN (yeah, I am a nerd like that) we can just say "I yield my time to ...." and name a delegate that seems to be the least awake; it mostly ends up that he/she has a lot to say and starts participating in the debate, or else you at least you wake them up… for a while:) About the practice AP test we took, I find it to be the best preparation for the test we can get. I just want to know what I would actually have gotten if it was the real test. I found mult. choice test to be the hardest part of it (stand. tests), the essays were fine. The prompt about Emerson was interesting, especially since we have studied him and read his works; I didn't focus as much on conventions, except for the usage of simple/complex sentences and the "..." to communicate effectively. Shakespeare essay was awesome cause I just have read a lot of him and the prompt was pretty broad and open for interpretation. It helps a lot to have background info about prompts. Now I think we should just really focus on reviewing the literary terms and grammar, I have problems coming up with literary terms, and also some of the mult. choice questions on grammar need review. I think our class is well prepared, we all read and write a lot, and Mrs. VA covered grammar/terms pretty well.
I feel this is a great article that everybody should read: urlLink Segregation no longer black and white New issues fifty years after Brown v. Board decision It supports some educator's arguments that today's schools are actually as segregated or even more segregated than ever. Segregated for a variety of reasons: huge discrepancy of wealth, economic gap, culture differences, community separations, and continued racial problems and misunderstandings. This culturally, economically, and racially segregated school systems in turn shows up in the huge differences in the "standardized" testing scores. This problem really boggles those "No Child Left Behind" testing conformist's mind and is a threat to their "everybody conform to the same standard" ideology. I would like to hear everyone's arguments and opinions on this issue. Thomas Chen
Mrs. VA, I think trying to get more people involved in the discussions is a good idea. However, knowing what it's like to be one of the ones that is not easily motivated to state my opinion during class, I feel that the best way would be to encourage the other students to try to bring the less responsive ones into the discussion. Having a teacher pinpoint you in the middle of a discussion never seems to work too well. Throughout middle school and other classes many teachers have used that as a technique as a form of punishment for not paying attention, but for our class, many people are paying attention they just don't say as much. Therefore if it's the other students it wont be as much of punishment, but should bring about more of a casual converstion which will allow everyone to feel more comfortable.
As far as I know, Kailie Veys had the highest multiple choice score with an adjusted (incorrect guess penalty included) score of 23/43. Sorry if I betrayed her trust in this, but I'm proud of her accomplishment. On to class participation; I don't think bribing responses is the way to go. Everyone comes out of their shell, some of us are fortunate to have expatriated earlier, but sometimes forcing someone to respond only delays their comfort. The best possible scenario is to create an environment where the shy can feel that their thoughts and feelings will be appreciated. Many people have expressed to me that what they have to say they don't feel other people want to hear; that their thoughts aren't on the same level as the "intellectuals"; that they feel stupid with what they have to say. While there isn't anything that can be done about those angsts, for those that don't feel confortable contributing; know that you needn't worry or feel judged. Anything that can be contributed adds to the formation of other thoughts and truely helps a discussion. Lastly; some of those questions in those Peterson tests are so damn frustrating and often times ridiculous. There should never be a scenario where one must choose between "argue" and "dispute." They're the same thing!!! In history, the Fed either "raised interest rates" or "discouraged borrowing." All the Fed does is control interest rates and inflation, so the answers are the same!!! Traditionally, the practice tests are harder thant he actual tests. For a potentially more accurate representation of your score, you can take old tests that were prepared by the college board, accessible at www.collegeboard.com. Find the AP section, and we're taking AP Lang, not Lit, so be wary. Once again, good luck on the test! Love, Rob
Mrs. VA, I absolutely agree that it's time to use some forceful means to rally everybody into sharing their ideas and speak up in class. That's actually a great idea actually of setting up a ground rule for everybody to speak, except that I'm not that kind of person who wants to jumpstart forcing other people to speak. But it would be nice for everybody in our class to finally break the "shyness" barrior.......after almost a whole year has gone by. So for all you, please just start randomly question "Underrepresented" people "what do you think of this", or "what's your opinion on this issue". I'm SURE everyone has great ideas to share, the "laziness", "uncertainty", and "shyness" are the only barriors. In other news, third period would really like to know what was the highest grade on the English AP practice test multiple choice section in first period? Somehow almost every member of third period has a feeling that first period is "smarter" and engages in better discussions that us. Don't be shy to share your comments now :) Thomas Chen
Hello! I'm so pleased to see you all carrying on such a lively conversation; you're informed, you're responding to each other, and you're connecting all kinds of ideas and subjects. Literature leads to culture, which leads to politics, which leads to a need to communicate civilly, which leads back to writing and literature. Truly, you folks are the kinds of students teachers dream of when they first go into teaching. I also appreciate your feedback about what is happening in class. Concerning discussion...this has come up before. Those of you who are participating feel like we are in a rut, as if you are dragging many unwilling--or unresponsive--bodies along with you. Speakers and non-speakers become entrenched in their roles, and soon, class is predictable. Boring. So why have I allowed this? Part of my role as a teacher is to facilitate, to push students to do what they would not be willing to do on their own. I have a preferred style, though, that is based on respect of students' choices. I find it very difficult to make a person speak if he or she is not willing. Why? Some people are painfully shy, and to be made to speak causes that student to suffer. I would like class conversation to work like it does at a good dinner party, where people speak because they are interested and engaged. I give all of you prep work, and I make the assumption that if you have done the work, you have the tools to speak. And I expect you to be motivated enough--courageous enough--to conquer fear of a large room and state your opinion. Perhaps this is idealistic of me, yet this is what democracy depends upon. In the way we have a large group of silent people, our class is echoing a societal trend. Small numbers of people bother to get out and vote; small numbers of people in class participate in discussion. What do we do? I could be an autocrat and put people on the spot, giving "points" to those who have an anwer. Is this the role of a teacher? Is this what you want class to look like? Feel like? Do you want speaking aloud to be connected to rewards and punishments? To take this analogy further, should we somehow punish people who choose to avoid their responsibilities as US citizens? Dock their pay if they don't vote? The classroom is a special place, though. It wasn't until extra credit was offered that any of you chose to participate in the blog. So what to do? When leaders are organizing activities, one of the things they know to do is to invite specific individuals to participate in the group. All of you who participate in this blog participate in class, also. By speaking aloud, others will see you as class leaders. If you want to maintain a democratic classroom, where students feel like equals and I am not treating you all as minions, what if you were to start inviting other students to respond? Why should I be the one to ask questions, just because I am the teacher? Don't you all ask questions of each other when you are in small groups? What if you start doing this in a large group? Who do you want to hear from? Ask that person a question, draw them in. What kind of encouragement/lessons/announcements (if any) do you need from me to help you take a more active role in making discussion work? I have been in classes before where one of the ground rules for discussion is that no one in the room may make more than 2 comments until everyone has been invited to share something with the large group. We could do this if you'd like. It can feel contrived; however, if you want to change the dynamic of class, this is a system that can help encourage change. What do you think? Mrs. V-A
Yeah I can finally blog, Ryan I too am a rookie at this. It was so nice to go outside today instead of look at another essay. I feel that occasionally a break from strenuous study adds to your understanding of whatever your studying. I found this to be true when I was reading Thoreau (WOW that was a long time ago) and I practice this regularly. I don't know if that is a good or a bad habit. I wanted to test out the waters of blogging and I have, so Good Night! ~ Frank
I was dreading taking the practice AP english test all week, anticipating the worst possible three hours, or coming really close to having to take the french one. However, after taking it today it wasn't as bad as I had thought. The multiple choice part wasn't too bad but I tend to take too much time reading and rereading... oh well. The essays weren't extremely difficult either, and amazingly i finished all of them, even with a conclusion. However the second one where we had to discuss how Emerson used the English language and conventions was a little more difficult. Also, like it was said earlier, I noticed that Shakespeare was used and I found that to be odd considering he wasnt American, which is what we have been studying all year.
There were a few obscurites in the multiple choice section..never felt overwhelmed though, and finished in plenty of time. By the way, did anyone notice how I used an elipsis instead of transition words there? Basically, that's how I responded to the Emerson prompt. Picked one or two conventions that seemed blatantly obvious, and beat them till they died, then beat them some more. I can't tell if I was too redundant or not, but the familiarity with the author DEFINITELY eased the pain. It made reading the passage go much smoother, and I felt not bad about it overall. I was suprised at the Shakespeare prompt because it was so vast and wide, not really what I'm used to. It also suprised me that it asked for Shakespeare (which I remembered enough of to respond), because he's super old and not American. Overall I feel confident (more so after some grammar review), but this will not be my most difficult test. Good luck to everyone! Love, Rob
Hey, how did everyone think of that practice AP multiple choice/three essays practice test we took? how do you think you are prepared? Any comments/feelings/complaints/sorrows/anger/stress/suggestions/questions about the AP English test? To me personally, the multiple choice section was harder than the free response section (Still a lot of interpretations, confusions, and ambiguities in the multiple choice answers). And within the free-response essays, i felt that the one about the English conventions/language was the hardest, although since the passage was about Emerson, the familiarity of the author kind of comforted me a little. It was weird talking about how Emerson persuades the reader his opinions with the use of "conventions", such things as grammar, the parts of English language that I tend to ignore its importance. Yeah so overall, that was a challenging piece to write as the essay prompt demanded "a well reasoned and organized essay". But other than that, I liked the free-free response essay that we can draw on our own experiences, readings, and observations for that last essay. It wasn't so strict as to just interpret a small piece of passage.. Please do respond with your opinions on the AP english practice test. Thomas Chen
O Paul! I read the Da Vinci Code! It's a GREAT book. I recommend it to everyone. The different hidden symbols found in the artwork and the secret organization of the Priory of Sion is just so interesting. However if you do read it I recommend you go online and look at some of the paintings discussed in the book. This will give you a good visual of what's described in the book. It's very entertaining and it allows you to explore new ideas. It's also fun to try to solve the different puzzels throughout the book.
About third period being soo quiet, I think it's almost become a routine that others don't notice or don't care anymore. I know some people are just lazy, and believe me, third period just seems to drag on forever, but I think some also feel intimidated. Everyone, well the only five or so people that actually talk always have really good ideas and are usually really smart, so others, including me, only think of the obvious when it comes to most of our discussions. So either you don't want to state the obvious or someone else says it before you get the chance. This has resulted that now when Ms. VA asks us all a question that no one really understands everyone leaves it up to the same people who always find a response that fits what she is looking for. If people know they can get away without having to say anything during a discussion they will probably stay that way for the rest of the year, so unfortunately it seems that the same people will lead the discussions once more, unless something drastic changes.
I would just like to make a comment in general. I don't know if first period is the same, but our third period class really bums me out sometimes. I am pretty vocal in class (I need to shut up sometimes) but honestly a lot of the time I end up raising my hand and commenting because so few people do! Our class discussions consist of about five people talking, and everyone else just sitting there, and I think it would be really nice for everyone to get involved. Just sharing a thought...
Paul we're both too worried about our images. Maybe we didn't need to apologize, but we'll just chalk it up to dignity and chivalry. Even if our politics don't see eye to eye, we agree on the worth of the New York Times. The NYT (as it is known by those IN the know) posts its articles online without a monetary fee of any kind, all they ask for is your e-mail. If you want, The NYT will send you the morning headlines on the subjects that interest you (business, politics, international, sports, etc.) with links to their articles, but more on that later. I haven't read DaVinci code, but I'm damn interested. Copies are flying off the shelves, and I'm all for a nonstop read (I've read every Harry Potter book but the last one atleast 3 times, and I'm not ashamed to admit it). For something shorter and tied to "Night," a town in Italy is attempting to convict several former Nazi SS members (a story I got through the free NYT e-mail headline service). You can read about it here; http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/international/europe/18TUSC.html?th . I have my opinions, but didn't read "Night," so I'd like it if someone else gave theirs. I'm posting this on Miss Clark's blog as well, so if you have her for a teacher she feels neglected because her blog doesn't get this kind of action. I'd also like other viewpoints on the issues and differences in opinions Paul and I worked ourselves through. I'd enjoy this to be a political forum, and I know you all have something to say on the world as is today. Love, Rob
I feel I came off as too defensive. I really don't mind anything political getting posted here, I just feel... obliged to post my rebuttal wherever it's relevant. That being said, you really don't have to 'clarify yourself in a dignified manner' I felt your original post, even if meant for Thomas' rather less tame personal blog, was fine and no personal slight at my personal politics at all. I guess I was just on a defensive republican bent that night, probably worrying about Kerry's successful poll numbers:-) So I guess I'm apologizing for sounding like a bitchy little republican, you really have no reason to apologize, clarification is often a must in debate but I really don't think you said anything out of line or offensive to me. So to steer the conversation anyway in a different direction.... Who's read the Da Vinci code here? I started reading it yesterday and really can't put it down. There's nothing particularly wonderful or interesting in the prose, but I find the storytelling and suspense to be excellent, as well as the subject matter.
Paul, your arguments were effective, logical, and I respect them. While this isn't an excuse for anything I stated, the post was meant to go to Thomas Chen's personal blog, but I'm on three of them, and all the post screens look the same except for a small titleline in the top right corner, and I accidentally posted it on this one. Anyway, the first half of this is an apology for the crude, unpolished, vulgar post from before. This is not characteristic of me, as my previous posts (I hope) convey. Back to the issue at hand... I'll sum up the previous post in a more formal language; There is an element of monarchy (in both Democratic AND Republican parties) in that there is a lineage of elitists that are pedigreed to run the country, and that these families become separated from many of the realities of Joe American, which I believe manifests itself in the use of American soldiers as expendable tools. John Kerry was one of these expendables, and as far is foreign policy is concerned, could draw from his personal experiences, which were perilous no matter what that article implied (Don't try to tell me that having a rocket shot at your boat doesn't deserve an award if you are the commander, as well as going after the shooter who could very well have been able to defend himself with another, closer-range firearm. And don't forget the Oregon vet's story that was so popular on the campaign trail, and that may have been Kerry's push over Dean. And demeaning the Purple-Hearts is also a joke... as if it was his obligation to reject them??? But I've digressed). Back to the issue; a man who knows the detriments and personal losses of war would be more hesitant to thrust the volunteer (How many soldiers do you believe volunteered to fight for Sadam's phantom WMDs) soldiers (How many soldiers do you believe volunteered to fight for Sadam's phantom WMD's) into a frivolous war. Point 2. I believe Bush's war against Iraq is entirely a farce with negative short term and long term affects. The short-term affects is the death toll that grows daily. Long term affects are more anti-American senitiments that take a death toll and add hundreds or thousands in a single day (9/11, USS Cole, embassy bombings). If a regime change is the goal, don't lie about it, but as of now Bush is using American men and women to fight for oil, which is necessary to accomodate America's mass automotive transportation. And reflecting current consumer trends and the pressure on Bush to secure American jobs (ridiculous amounts of which outsourced by GM to Mexico), more gas is needed to satisfy the throats of gas-chugging SUV's, trucks, and to a lesser extent, vans; in all of said categories American companies generally control the market. If gas gets too expensive, American cars depreciate in a hurry and sales numbers go down, resulting in more GM/Daimler Chrysler layoffs. I'm entirely aware that Japanese car companies have success in this country for a variety of reasons, which I understand to be largely affordability, dependability, and gas mileage. GM is one of the largest companies in America, and rather than allow the pressure from another market to create a need for quality improvement, Bush's actions act in giving American motor companies too much room for error. The last point that a gas tax would emphasize fuel-efficiency, environmental protection, and reduce accidents is largely unarguable. If you disagree with the principal of taxes, that's your opinion, but let me point out that Andrew Sullivan, the author of the article that brought the issue to my attention, is a REPUBLICAN. Not that a Democrat wouldn't support it, but take care when you go throwing around those increasingly meaningless slanders such as "liberal and conservative." I hope I have clarified myself in a somewhat dignified manner. If I missed something, you have further questions, or just plain disagree, please post a response. One more apology for accidentally posting a private on a public, I will be sure to take more care in the future. Love, Rob

Does anyone have any book recomendations after reading over spring break? -Pat
I really don't have much to say about AP tests or ASB elections... but politics--- If military experience was a prerequisite for being a successful President or commander in chief of the armed forces I'd fear for the future of this country. And I'd hardly compare Kerry to true war heroes such as Audy Murphy, here's a section of an article describing Kerry's Vietnam medals and tour. But neither of those matter, the bottom line is, when you enlist in the military you are enlisting in the military. You job is to be ready for war. In war you are put in harms way. Everyone in Iraq right now knew what they were getting into, we have a volunteer military. The loss of every life, especially the civilian ones, is a great trajedy, the real issue is should we even be in Iraq, but that's a whole other issue.- Kerry served on swift boats for about four months. During that time, he was awarded the Bronze Star (the lowest decoration for heroism in combat) and the Silver Star (the next higher decoration for valor) and three Purple Hearts for wounds sustained in battle. These latter decorations — like my title of "nationally syndicated columnist" — sound more impressive than they are. All three wounds were minor cuts from shrapnel, which, according to Kerry, caused him to miss a grand total of 2 days of duty. For soldiers and Marines, especially of the enlisted variety, a Silver Star is a big deal. You've got to do something profound to get one. But the rules were different for officers, especially for naval officers. This is the action on Feb. 28, 1969, for which Kerry was awarded the Silver Star: A Viet Cong fired a B-40 rocket at Kerry's boat, Patrol Craft Fast-94. Tom Belodeau, manning the twin 50-caliber machine guns at the rear of the boat, opened fire on the VC, wounding him. The VC fled behind a hooch. Kerry ordered PCF-94 to shore, leaped out of the boat, pursued the VC, and finished him off. I can envision grizzled infantrymen shaking their heads. "He got the Silver Star for that?" Kerry had an advantage most servicemen do not. Medal recommendations have to be made by the commanding officer of the unit in which the heroism took place. Kerry was the commander of PCF-94. Presumably, Kerry's medal recommendation was made by the commander of the squadron to which PCF-94 belonged. But Kerry's commander wasn't there. The evidence he had of the heroism of Lt (jg) John F. Kerry came chiefly from the after action report of Lt. (jg) John F. Kerry. Shortly after being awarded the Silver Star, Kerry took advantage of a provision in Navy regulations that permits a sailor who has been wounded three times to obtain early release from his combat tour. For Kerry — since his wounds were so minor — this was taking advantage of a technicality. There is nothing wrong with this. Many officers similarly situated would have done the same. But it wasn't heroic. To recap: Kerry was a double volunteer. As a swift boat commander, he was brave and able. But I am unaware of any soldier or Marine who was awarded a decoration of any kind — much less the Silver Star — just for killing a wounded man who was running away. Though it is being hyped far beyond what it warrants, Kerry's Vietnam service was honorable. What is not honorable is the way Kerry — in testimony before Congress in April, 1971 — falsely accused his fellow Viet vets of routinely committing grisly war crimes. Nor does it speak well of Kerry that in several demonstrations he marched under the flag of the Viet Cong. It is one thing to oppose the war in Vietnam. It is another to cheer for the enemy. Why is there hope in John Kerry? If the major issue with the president choosing to send troops to war, because of the evils of war, then no President since maybe Gerald Ford(I'm just guessing) would fit your criteria. I find it hard to believe President Bush is as cold and heartless as he is portrayed to be here. I really doubt he's any different than any other President, I'd just like to say that character slander is not an effective means of policy debate which is what is truly at debate here. Tell me why Kerry won't be bought because his wife has billions? Kerry is already bought, he's bought because he wants to win. You can't buy votes with billions but you can buy votes with endorsements. Kerry's wife is rich, yes, so she can fund his campaign along with George Soros. But Kerry is already bought by the standard democratic special interest groups, labor unions, environmentalists, trial lawyers(by far the worst) because he hopes their endorsements will entice members of their groups to vote for him. In exchange for those endorsements he agrees to give them more sway in his administration, it's just how the system works. It would be nice if everyone looked out for everyone and the common good but that's not going to happen. All politics are corrupt, Democrats and Republicans equally. I agree completely that we went to Iraq for oil, and I don't think we should be there. I certainly understand the benefits of securing a new nation under our sway in the middle east, removal of bases to Iraq from Saudi Arabia would certainly quell some anti American sentiment in that nation and put our bases closer to Israel. OPEC has too much power over the United States economy and the global economy, but setting a precedent of a preemptive strikes frightens me. Nothing would make me happier to see the US freed from oil, and the Bush administration has done an admirable job of using tax credits to push ahead gas/electric hybrids and to cut oil usage, such as in new federal requirements tying fuel efficiency requirements to vehicle weight. The single issue of gas prices is not what gives the Japanese car makers the edge, it's a rather unique combination of luck, trade policies and union interference that has put detroit second to tokyo as of recently. But this years trends from detroit have been towards cars, while some from Tokyo, most notably Nissan and Honda have certainly been to expand into less fuel efficient vehicles such as SUVs and trucks. It's impossible to generalize on such as level or attribute it to something as arbitrary as gasoline prices. Rob's suggestion of putting a 1 dollar tax on gas is why I'm not a democratic supporter as a general rule. Liberal policies dictates a negative approach to social engineering. Why not offer an incentive, a tax break on buying a gas efficient car or a hybrid. Democratic ethos dictates, RAISE TAXES. Push people away from gas, not try to entice them away. The federal government is simply too inefficient and bureaucratic to justify it taking any more tax money from the private sector. Democrats want to take it away more so than Republicans, but they both want it. Lesser of two evils. I guess that's a rather sad commentary on my approach to politics and maybe our system in general but I digress. Read the New York Times at www.nytimes.com even if it's a liberal rag it still beats the pants off the Columbian and Oregonian combined.
I would actually vote you for ASB president, believe it or not. And I would take on the responsibility of an ASB selected position if I can get my .5 credits of PE waived. I will already have five AP classes next year, and if the PE department won't be like a bigot like they usually do, I could manage my sixth period a leadership class. But if they become a usual royal pain in the ass, (Yeah they think PE is so much harder and more important than AP Literature or AP Physics) then I will have to resort to my last resort, and that is, to take all SIX AP classes. But anyways, a new book just came out on Bush's secret plan to invade Iraq right when the invasion of Afghanistan started. The book is called "Plan of Attack" by Bob Woodward. Peace out, and let's all have a moment of silence for all the innocent soldiers killed in Iraq. Thomas Chen
Stress is right...thank GOD for the weekend. I'm taking three ap tests which will sound infantile and scoffable next to Tom's FIVE or so, but I'm working on Prom day and night. Laugh if you want for me expending so much time and effort perpetuating a night of drunkeness and morally relaxed practices, I sometimes shake my head myself, but it's what I signed up for and it's hard and stressful. Go to prom and appreciate my hard work damn it! Any way... it sickens me that the people that send others to their death a.ka. the Bush administration, do so without feeling the pain so many American families do when they lose a brother/mother/father/sister/friend/lover/fellow blogger in Iraq. Bush's connection with the world has been GENETICALLY REMOVED. Whether like to think of it or not, we elect monarchies. W. Bush is something like the great great great great nephew of Madison or something. There's no difficulty tracing a Kennedy bloodline either. There is hope in Kerry. He opted to fight in Vietnam rather than lynch himself over a balcony, and his experiences there gave him credibility teaching (what should be the obvious) wrongs of war. His wife has billions, so don't expect him to be bought, and he doesn't claim his greatest mistake was TRADING SAMMIE FUCKING SOSA. The dumbass Bush couldn't run a major league baseball team successfully, but we gave him the country!?!? Edwards was the best answer, but he was too decent to sling mud, so Kerry it is. I think it's obvious we went to Iraq for oil, becaue Iraq isn't/never was a threat to the security of the u.s. (North Korea is however) and the war has done nothing but stimulate enrollment for Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, and other groups hell-bent on making their suicide hurt anyone that's not Muslim. Bush and Cheney are both oil-men (duh) and they're sick of having their balls in opec's vice, so they want to secure an oil flow. How bout eliminating the need for oil? Andrew Sullivan wrote a thought-provoking essay supporting the case for a gas tax of $1 per gallon. It's what the rest of the world does, and it would result in a trend toward fuel-efficient cars, cut down on polution, and get many people off the road-reducing accident rates and deaths. Bush won't do it though... it would give Japanese carmakers too much of an edge, and right now GM is pumping out SUV's as fast as bunnies are pump out kittens. By the way, I'm going to run for ASB president next year, and I want to see some representation from the bloggers that post on this site. Elias, Tom, Pav, et al. if you have schedule room, uncle sam wants YOU! Help to keep the ASB diversified. And if Alex R. still wants to talk shit bout Evan Cate, shame on him... I've been sitting on this for a while, but Evan is one of the most honest, genuine kids I know, and I'm glad he's my friend. I'm out- talk back. And if nonconformity becomes too popular, conform to nonconform. Love Rob
Thomas - I agree with you absolutely that individualism is absolutely great and that America is truly a country of immense opportunities. But I think too many people in this country tend to look up to their heros who dared to be individuals, yet simply stay satisfied and happy that someone else represents them so well and that they can get by, by simply idolizing these heroes. Maybe its not right to say this, but there are too many people that look like blind, brainless cattle that has to be guided and taken care of. Not just in our school, or just in America, but everywhere I have been. I work as a teller and see many people come in during the day, but there are only a few faces that I recognize when they come back, becuase these faces have something special about them, like a special radiating energy of being different. Yet, I believe in a "friendly individualism," where people are not simply egoistic and competing, but where they help others and modivate people around them to develope their own individuality. Rob - I think American culture as a whole seems to tend to idealize and make everything seem heroic. I just think that there are way too many controversies in American history and literature: Jefferson, freedom and slaves; WWII, Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima Nagasaki; Freedom, civil rights and gay marriages; the only thing that seems to go hand in hand is Bush and his idiotism (no offence to anyone).
I'd have to agree with Natalya on the theme of Self-Reliance and individualism is one UNIQUE theme to American literature and Americans. This is probably the only time I will appear as an American egotistical bigot. But I truely believe that America is a country founded on progressive beliefs, reforming individuals, and revolutionary ideas. Famous Americans of the past had always had an urge for freedom of speech, freedom of expression, and freedom of THINKING. The famous American authors of the past: from founding fathers Jefferson, Franklin, Paine, to Transcendentalists Emerson, Thoreau, to poets Whitman, Dickinson, to realist writers Mark Twain, Faulkner, to muckrackers Tarbell, Steffens and to civil rights activist MLK; they all inspire Americans with the vivid themes of individualism and the interaction between the individual and the society. Many of them of course were all considered radicals just because of their progressive ideas. But they are some of the most brilliant Americans. All of them wanted to, and they did, forever change America for the better. Seriously, in comparison, Chinese classical literature is all about the art of war and at the same time harmony with nature (juxtaposed against each other), and respecting elders, and conforming to society (which of course, many of you know I abhor). Yeah the theme of individualism is a farfetch idea in most of the world. To truely live up to the American ideal, I believe American citizens have to always strive for the theme of believe in one self, and strive for individual rights, and find one's unique place in the society. It's when people stop thinking about American literature with the theme of individualism, self reliance, and self-expression, that causes me frustrated. When people stop using brain and thinking about the society with their own unique point of view, and let others make judgements for them, and blindly conforms to the mainstream society, then they've lost the integral value of American individualism. Losing one's unique place in the society fundamentally degrades the morals of human beings, and dictators dreams to have a society of dumb people that blindly conforms to the society. I don't believe that's what America, the land of opportunity, is all about. Thus................Always think for yourself, and always question all authority. As always, I welcome all dissagreements (P.S. Dissagreeing is also one element of American individualism). Thomas Chen.
Paul, thanks for bringing up the nature of other categories of national literature. Last year we had a much more cosmopolitan curriculum, and thinking back to Dr. Zhivago, I have to agree with Natalya on the desolation that Pasternak wrote about. We read about Okonkwo too, and the let down he obviously felt when his tribe was weakening. We also have read some western European novels and essays- Tale of Two Cities, All Quiet on the Western Front, et al. Tale of Two Cities was really a political observation where personal relationships just worked themselves out, and All Quiet addressed the feeling of hopelessness war carries. America truly is unique that it hasn't had to experience the despariging wars (other than Civil War) that Europe and Asia have dealt with, and that's the best evidence I can uncover to explain the difference in literary themes. Many people in the world view Americans as arrogant and possessing other undesirable characteristics. Does the attitude that we can do it on our own come through in the lit? Or do Americans just lust for heros? I find this all very interesting. Maybe Tristan will tell me what I want to hear. Shifting gears, what did you all think of the in-class essay today? I enjoyed it, but being a dick, I could swear that passage came out of Disability. No matter how strong Mairs portrays herself, you can still see her pain in the words she uses. Lastly, in his press conference, Bush claimed he couldn't think of a mistake he's made in office. You have to respect the guy a smidge for believing in himself, but I'd like to make a list of mistakes he's made. Ignoring all his verbal blunders, I'll start the list off with the suggestion that Saddam and Al Qaeda were linked, last time I checked it was a lie, and it got Clinton impeached (which he deserved). If anyone's got an item to add, please post it. Love Rob
NIGHT. A very compelling read. But since everyone is talking about their books on here I thought I would mix it up a bit.......and give some references to music. First of all, Im sure there are people out there with different tastes in music......I myself prefer a mix of alternative, rap, and classic rock. Sorry I'm not an Enya fan. First of all I would like to make the recommendation that by sigining up at Yahoo Music, you can create your own radio station that plays almost every genre, customized to your own style. This is free and is VERY useful when I get sick of all the stuff that is played on the radio or on CD's. But anyways......a few recommendations.....for a pop type of CD I would recommend Hoobastanks new CD, listen to "The Reason" or "Lucky". I classic rock CD I would recommend would be the Red Hot Chili Peppers greatest Hits or anything by the Beatles(can't really go wrong with the Beatles) A rap selection...lets see....Kayne West or Twista seem to be two of the most popular at the time but a solid choice would be Jay-Z's Black Album.....Jay-Z's last album. If you are into the same music of me.....I would recommend anything by 3 Doors Down or the Goo Goo Dolls.....very solid choices in those albums. Anyways, just thought I would mix up the blog with a little culture. -Pat
Beck- I absolutely love you, no seriously, it's like you have been reading my mind, only you are way better in expressing it. I agree that it's funny how we worry about the least important things every day, and if you look at the big picture our lives so unimportant, they can be simply compared to that pile of ants, each ant is so small and what he does is so small, and yet I am sure he thinks that what he is doing is important. I mean, 4 children die every hour from malnutrition... strange, I have been reading Biology for the past hour... 4 children just died... do I feel anything? No. Can I even comprehend the fact that 4 innocent lives just died? Not really. I was watching the news today and they were talking about one of the Italian hostages being killed in Iraq, and I remember thinking: they make such a big deal out of this one death when at the same time there are hundreds, thousands of people dying every day. I think it's simply because we have gotten used to these statistics of how many people are dying in Africa from AIDS and how many have died during the Holocaust. The horror simply gets saturated and you get used to it, and that's how saw Wiesel's experience as his story extended in the book: the first time he saw babies been thrown into the flames of crematory his reaction was " How could it be possible for them to burn people, children, and for the world to keep silent? No, none of this could be true. It was a nightmare...," compared to the reaction of when his father is taken away to the crematory "I did not weep, and it pained me that I could not weep. But I had no more tears. And, in the depth of my being, in the recesses of my weakened conscience, could I have searched it, I might perhaps have found something like - free at last!" I have heard from many people about Night and everyone said that they cried whenever they read it, but strangely the first time I read the book I didn't shed a tear. I have read many books like this one, I cried reading "The Pianist," and "All Quiet on the W. Front," even "Of Mice and Men" but this one was dry, it felt as if Wiesel was simply stating facts and these facts have been already known and there was simply too much of it and too hard to believe that such things could be true, too saturated with horror. Paul - it does feel like self-reliance is much more prominent in American literature than in any other. At least drawing on what I know about Russian literature that's the feeling I get. I read A LOT of Russian novels and most have this trend of sorrow, grief and disillusionment with the people and world around, maybe that's why Russians tend to be so "mean," cynical and full or sarcasm. But I think Russian authors are great on analyzing human nature, and our lonely desolate souls; read "Crime and Punishment." Ryan- you know it's funny how in America everyone simply stands up for himself and takes care of his own private business, but that does leave us lonely and without friends or anyone to talk to. George has to get rid of his burden too in order to be able to go on, but does he need the farm, now that he doesn't have his friend to share it with? Does the old man, Candy, want to go on, now that he lost his dog, his only friend? I think self-reliance and independence are over-rated.
Going off of Ryan Elliot's post, the theme of loneliness struck me the most when I read 'Of Mice and Men.' The old man who lost he dog is so frightened of being all alone for the rest of his life that he still wants to join George and Lennie's dream farm even after Lennie kills Curley's wife. Also I think that Curley's wife is one of the loneliest people in the novel. I think the thing she wants the most is a friend and someone to talk to. She's so lonely that she tries too hard to be liked by all the farmhands thus becoming unpleasant to be around. She dislikes her husband and she doesn't know who to turn to. Lennie is the only person who will talk to her. However, it's also Lennie who ends up killing her. On a side note I think Paul's post was really interesting about self reliance being more of a human concept in our literature. I think it would be nice to "live on the fatta and lan." :)
Amazing what extra credit will do for a blog, won't it;-) I never really have much to say anymore, but I know our whole theme this year has been self reliance in American literature. If self reliance is American literature, what's British literature, or French literature or Russian literature or Chinese literature. I'm simply curious as to if it's really uniquely American, or more a human concept in our literature. As for turning the blog political, I say go for it, I just wish I had more time to frequently check in here.
I'm really liking the fact that so many people are posting. There are a lot of good ideas generated in each mind/group/class period, and I'm really enjoying reading them so keep it up! (Beck, your post was especially eloquent) Today in class, (M) discussion seemed especially productive in my group, and I thought we came up with a really thought-provoking level 3 q. Lennie and George rely on each other for various reasons; does their relationship signify a shift in American Literature AWAY from self-reliance? I think it's quite interesting because since Emerson and Franklin to Huck Finn, there has always been that underlying theme. The suggestion that Lennie and George can be viewed as one entity and are self-reliant in that way was one way of countering the question, but has anyone read anything to suggest that there is a paradigm shift in American Lit? What events could be triggering this shift? Post your thoughts, and anything else you'd like to say... I'd like this blog to become somewhat of a politcal/current events forum as well, because I like to argue. Love Rob
I wasn't so excited to start reading these books, but I had heard that Of Mice and Men was an excellent book. It is very intersting to see how Steinbeck shows how much these two men resemble people in a family. I relate this a lot to myself, I see Lennie as my brother who has some difficulties and challenges, and me as George. Sometimes I get real fed up with him, and extremely annoyed, and I do things like George that then tend to hurt his feelings, make me feel bad and then apologize and make it up to him. My brother is also big like Lennie, and if anyone else trys to take advandtage of him or make fun of him, it ticks me off. The same thing is with George, no one else can do anything to Lennie except him. I like the way Steinbeck uses a lot of sentence manipulation so you can get a real grip of the attitude the characters have espcecially Lennie, it really helps the reader get into the book more.
In a discussion about "Of Mice and Men" our group observed that George and Lennie's mutualistic friendship creates a theme of interdependence, which differs from the popular theme of self-reliance of the past semester. The works of Emerson, Thoreau, and Franklin represent the fruits of solitude, and promote the benefits of self-sufficiency. In contrast, Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" shows the loneliness of seclusion and explains how interpersonal relationships are necessary in leading a fulfilled life. When George and Lennie arrive at the ranch they are hired to farm, their bond surprises a well respected ranchhand named Slim. George takes exception to Slim's reaction and Slim explains there aren't "many guys who travel around together...maybe ever'body in the whole damn world is scared of each other." Slim and the some of the other workers are envious and almost admire the friendship George and Lennie share. Their relationship enables them to divide the stress of work and travel, as opposed to bearing it individually. As the novel progresses the theme of mutualism stretches to recruit other characters. Candy, an old, one-handed swamper, loses his dog to old age and sees lonely, desolate days ahead of him. This depresses him and he spends most of his time staring at the wall of his bunk. Crooks, the negro stable buck, isn't allowed to play cards with the guys, and is forced to sleep in a solitary room away from his peers. Time eats away at these friendless men because as Crooks put it, "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody." Although self-reliance produces independence and pride within a man, it cannot pat him on the back, play a game of cards, or swap stories the way a friend can. Living as an equal in the world is an inherent human goal, and to sacrifice societal equality for isolation produces a burning loneliness that must be tempered with humanity. A few thoughts- Ryan Elliott
Like many others, after today's small group discussion I have new thoughts on the book Night. My group spent much of the period analyzing what the main theme of the book was and we came to two conclusions. The first theme that we noticed was the naive/optimistic attitude the Jews had towards the Germans and the treatment they would receive in the events that led up to being sent to Auschwitz.(sp?) The basis behind this theme most likely comes from the strong faith Jews had in God at this time period. Even after being sent to the concentration and experiencing the cruel treatment of the Germans, Jews still had an optimistic view stating "God must be testing us." Although Weisel himself begins to lose faith in God, many Jews still believed God was "just testing them." The second theme my group noticed was individualism in the concentration camps. Because the happenings at Auschwitz are so horrible, they begin to mold the spirit of many of the prisoners, Wielsel in particular. This theme is best shown when Wiesel's father is being beaten severely by a crazed guard. Instead of Wiesel becoming angry toward the guard, he instead is angry at his father for getting in the guards way. Wiesel, like many others, lose their ties with family and friends in an effort to "fend for themselves" at the concentration camps. These are the two most prominent themes my group saw in the book, are we missing a big one? -Pat
During the group descussions today in class, my group noticed something very interesting. I don't know where i'm going to go with it, but i thought i might throw it out there anyway. Our group was talking about Night, and we were busy discussing how horrific/depressing the book is when we heard a neighboring group mention how someone in the other book had lost his pet mouse and therefore all the joy in his world. We went kind of silent for a minute and looked at each other. How does a mouse compare to the Halocaust? And then we just went back to our discussion. But i've been stuck on it all day, and i think that our reaction has as much to say as the juxtoposition of the books does. And i think that it all has something to do with the human ability to completely ingore huge, world changing events (or the inability to understand them), like the halocaust. I'll let the great Eddie Izzard make the next point: "Pulpot killed 1.7 million people, we can't even deal with that. I think we think if somebody kills someone, that's murder, you go to prision. If you kill 10 people, you to to Texas, they hit you with a brick. That's what they do. Twenty people, you go to a hospital, they look at you through a small window at you forever. And over that, we can't deal with it, you know? Somebody's killed one hundred thousand people, we're almost going, 'well done! well done, you killed 100,000 people? You must get up very early in the morning. I can't even get down to the gym.' ...So i suppose we're glad that Pulpot's under house arrest, at least we know where he is. Just don't go in that house, you know?" Some people would probably say that we find little ways to deal with huge or horrible things ...like pet mice. But i think that we just completley ignore them. A revolution in Haiti? Ten thousand citizens dead in Iraq? Ariel Sharon pulls out of the West Bank? Terrorists attack Madrid? Oh. Okay. ...Did i leave the iron plugged in? God, my boyfriend's being so annoying these days. Do i look fat in this shirt?... Nevermind the 25 million people that die every year from hunger. Or the 34.3 million people who are looking a little skinny since they contracted AIDS. I'm not suggesting that we should think about this all the time every day, but it is valuable to be reminded every now and then. So yeah... I'd put some sort of conlcusion on this... but it'd be way easier if people posted responses (seeing as you all completely ignored my last post) that i could then steal ideas from. -Beck
I just have to mention the observation that as if 7:02 April 13th, we have two distinct ads on top JUXTAPOSED to each other. One about "supporting the loving conservative BUSH administration", and the other "Support Anti-War movement". Kind of hilarious. Yeah if you haven't figured out, Google (the owner of blogger), periodically "reads" your blogs and accordingly put appropriate banner ads on top. So our posts about drafts, holocaust probably caused google to put those ads up. And Megan, that quote there from Night is really insightful. Especially the part of "if we forget, we are guilty". (That's why history, historiography, and historical literature is so important). And finally Rob, to bring up that draft thing into perspective, it was actually two democrats who first initiated the plan. They think it would "democratize" the army system. Because they think it's not fair for a special group of people to fight. And of course many many Republicans support their plans, it helps them win their ambition of occupying Iraq. But yeah, there is some level of extremely scary muti-partisan support of the draft in the congress right now.
I finished 'Night' today. Mrs. VA said we may have to read it in chunks if it became to emotional for us, but I found myself not being able to put it down. I went online and looked up information about Elie Wiesel. I read his Nobel Prize Acceptance speech. Check it out, it's really good. http://www.eliewieselfoundation.org/ElieWiesel/Nobel_Speech.htm I also found some pictures of him. Mostly when he was older, but I found a picture taken when he was 15 or 14 before he was in the concentration camps. It made me think about the end of the book when he's looking in the mirror. I looked at the picture and I tried to imagine what he looked like at the end of the war. Here's a good quote from Wiesel. I think it does a pretty good job at summerizing why he wrote 'Night' and why understanding what happened during the Holocaust is so important. "I have tried to keep memory alive, I have tried to fight those who would forget. Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices...That is why I swore never to be silent whenever wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. "
I'm a "Mice and Men" kinda guy, and I'm going to agree with Thomas' "it's a comfortable read" quote. It's mostly dialogue and fun, quite frankly. Bringing the draft back is a heinous idea to me as well, and it drives me crazy because Bush is not being the president that (lost the popular vote but) we elected. Does anyone remember the debates of 2000 when W. Bush adamantly and outwardly expressed his distaste for the way Clinton was using the military? Saying directly that U.S. troops should not be used for nation building in other countries. Hmm... why does W. Bush want to reinstate the draft again? Ohh, that's right, it's because he needs more troops to continue his nation building in Iraq. Afghanastan was a justified war. I entirely understand why the Taliban had to be removed, and (with international backing) it was the right decision to invade. What W. Bush told the country the reason for invading Iraq was is SOMEWHAT legitimate because Saddam possessing biological/chemical weapons is a threat to our ally Israel, but that's not the reason he decided to invade. He can blame intelligence all he wants, but suggesting Iraq had tried to acquire Uranium based on zero evidence isn't the kind of credibility I want in a Commander In Chief. Now, as the motives continue to change, hundreds of Americans are dead because of a W. Bush lie, and he wants thousands more to risk their lives for a quest he said was not worth fighting before he was elected. I scoff at those who want to support W. Bush because they believe KERRY flip-flops positions. The more I think about it the sicker I get. I might type more, but I'm off to do my taxes, attempting to get back some of the money W. Bush is itching to turn into a deficit. Love, Rob P.S. I need a prom date, so if anyone has any ideas, please feel free to let me know.
I for one have never read Night. It is interesting and very depressing. At one point I had to stop reading because I felt so awful. But does everyone like the book that they have chosen? (I wanted to see if this worked too) Kaitlin
Maybe contrary to a lot of people, I'm reading "Of Mice and Men". The book so far is faring better than it's intro paragraphs, which when I heard Ms.VA read in class today, I thought it would be so boring. But right now it's becoming more and more like a Western Thriller book, with A LOT of Western vernacular language (as oppose to the Southern vernacular language we encountered in Huck Finn). It's easy to relate to that a lot of language directly imitates the coloquial language as people are speaking (non-sensored words). So overall, a comfortable read. Other than that, I encountered this article: urlLink about some members of the congress are even THINKING of RE-INSTATING the DRAFT.........Utterly sick.......... Yeah anyways, thats a great article, also talks about in December 2003 the United States had 1.44 million troops stationed in 141 countries. And here is an excerpt from an article from CNN: CHARLES RANGEL Democratic Congressman from New York and Korean War vet Staying the course in Iraq means increasing our troop strength, and, not surprisingly, recruitment and re-enlistment levels are down. But proposed enlistment bonuses and other economic incentives will not make the military any more attractive to upper-middle-class young people. Increasingly we will be a nation in which the poor fight our wars while the affluent stay home. To correct the disparity among those who serve, South Carolina Senator Fritz Hollings and I have proposed a new draft. All men and women ages 18 to 26 would be eligible for induction once they have completed high school. Those not needed in the military would perform civilian service. Enacting our plan would democratize our armed forces and return to the "citizen soldier" ideal that has served our nation so well. As a veteran, I strongly believe that fighting for our country must be fairly shared by all racial and economic groups. Nobody wants to go to war, but the burden of service cannot fall only on volunteers who, no matter how patriotic, are attracted to the military for financial reasons. We cannot continue to pretend it is fair that one segment of society makes all the sacrifices. CHARLES MOSKOS Professor of sociology at Northwestern University and a former draftee Our country is facing new kinds of threats and needs a new kind of draft. Even before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, our military was severely overstretched in fulfilling its missions. But more important, we have done nothing serious about homeland defense in the war against terrorism. We need guards for our nuclear power plants, dams and public facilities. We have done little to create the necessary border patrollers, customs agents and cargo-ship inspectors. Short-term draftees, under professional supervision, could perform these duties admirably. It takes less than four months to train a military police officer—precisely the kind of role most needed in peacekeeping missions and guard duties. This would free up professional soldiers, and it would stop the unprecedented activation of reservists. Their multiple tours have led to demoralization and impending recruitment shortfalls. We must institute a three-tiered draft system in America, with 15-to-24-month tours of duty for citizens ages 18 to 26. In the new-style draft, conscripts could serve in the military, in homeland security or in a civilian-service program like AmeriCorps—and there is no reason women could not be drafted for the latter categories JAMES INHOFE Republican Senator from Oklahoma I think I'm the only member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who would reinstate the draft. There are huge social benefits that come from it. I can assure you I would not be in the U.S. Senate today if I had not gone through the draft. When I look at the problems of some of our kids in America nowadays and then I go visit the troops, I see what a great benefit it is to give people the opportunity to serve their country. I was drafted into the Army in January 1957 and served two years as an enlisted man. I gained a new outlook on life through the rigors of basic training. The military can have a more intense influence on soldiers when they are drafted and have no choice. I developed a sense of patriotism through the experience of serving my country. I'm not on a crusade, but I think today's youth could use more of that type of discipline.
So far I am really enjoying the novel 'Night' due to the way in which the novel is written. The novel consists of choppy, simple and compound sentences, to enforce the view which he is writing from(a child's) while also creating a fearful, anxious tone in the book that comes from these choppy sentences. In class, Ms. V-A spoke of the novels "poetic tone." I believe this tone is derived from the sentence structure Wiesel uses in the novel(or atleast the first 15 pages). Is everyone else seeing this tone? Or something different? -Pat
Ya, I also already read 'Of Mice and Men.' I also read the New York Times at 4:30 in the morning everyday. I only read it then because I have to wake up early for zero period. 'Night' is really good so far. Really really sad though. My math teacher said he read the book when he was in high school and that it gave him nightmares. I hope I don't get nightmares. I don't know about the rest of you but AP testing is comming up too quickly.
Why didn't more people choose 'Of Mice and Men' than 'Night', there appeared to be at least twice as many people reading Night. For me personally, I've already read Night so Of Mice and Men was the logical choice. And go read the New York times, it's free online, www.nytimes.com it's good for the brain.
Hey, I hope you all had a fantastic break... I know I did. I read "Catcher In The Rye" over the break because there are a lot of references to it in other media sources...Six Degrees of Seperation and Chasing Amy are two movies that the book influences, but I never really felt the significance of it. It's a book narrated by a student our age about himself. He's having trouble dealing with his life- he makes references to suicide, he's kind of cynical, thinks everyone's a "phony," as well as intermitently dealing with the death of his brother. It's written coloquially (like Huck Finn only NINETEEN 50's), and it's kind of funny at times because Holden (the narrator) is such an oddball character, but it's nothing that's really going to change my life. If you're disconnected with your surroundings and like a straightforward read, you could identify with "Catcher," or if you're Thomas, and are rooting for the nonconformist protagonist, you might really identify. I guess it just wasn't what I expected, but I AM looking forward to "Of Mice and Men." Love, Rob
I visited some schools on the East Coast, and they had similar requirements. For Cornell and NYU, they usually take 4's and always take 5's. It appears some places accept 3's on a few tests, but that usually just allows you to transfer out of the class, it doesn't get you any credits. To actually get college credits takes a 4, or a 5, they seem to be more strict on the science and English tests most places I looked.
Hey that's a very good question and interesting topic. Yeah some school may offer a credit system in which a 3 may get you into a basic class, and 4 or 5 a more advanced class. But in order to eliminate 5 or more credits, most schools has to see that you have at least a 4 or 5 on most AP exams. UW is a very typical example of this AP credit system. Here is a link to see how much credits UW offer base on your AP scores: urlLink UW AP Class Credits
I know this may be very off topic but I just returned from Gonzaga and found out that Gonzaga and many other schools demand a 4 on the AP Test to count for college credit. While many of us last year when taking the World History exam believed that to "pass" we needed to get a 3.......well I guess we passed but it doesn't count for anything at alot of the schools that we may be trying to get into when applying next year. I have also heard a rumor that the University of Washington doesn't accept 3's......this is only a rumor but I would like to hear from anyone else who visited schools to see what other schools demand on the AP Test to count for college credit. -Pat
I'm seeing if this works.
I started reading "Fountainhead" a while ago, but I wasn't able to finish it. Too much stuff going on. If anyone is looking for a good book to read I recommend anything by Ayn Rand. She's an amazing author. Over spring break I plan to read "A Passage to India." I don't know much about it. My mom said it was good book. I should start reading it but I'm too absorbed in another book called "Battle Royale." It's by a Japanese author, and the book reminds me a lot of "Lord of the Flies." The government sends a bunch of kids out on an island and they have to kill each other and whoever is left alive at the end wins. It has a lot to do with government control over the people and what fear can cause you to do. It also relates to the saying of it's a dog eat dog world. It's really bloody, but interesting. Recently in AP US History we just finished up with WWII. We watched some video clips of the Holocaust with was really shocking for me. Anyway, I remembered something Mrs. VA said about her German friend and how he is still paying for WWII through high taxes, and how he was really upset because he had nothing to do with Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. An interesting book which relates to this is "The Reader" by German author Bernhard Schlink. It's a deep book containing a lot of philosophy. It centers around a young man who wasn't involved in WWII but still has to deal with the horrors of postwar Germany.
Well yeah, "Fountainhead" has a very straight-forward message for individuality, which I absolutely adore, but some people can probably find it a bit too zealous. Are you going to write the scholarship paper for the book Thomas? I think it's due on April 15th. I think you should also add a link to fastweb.com, maybe some people will find some good scholarship opportunities to write for. Do you have that list of 100 recommended books from collegeboard.com? I have "Candide" next on my list; let me know how good the book is.
Very inspirational post there Natalya. I agree that we need to have lots more multiple choice practices. And more examples and practices of creating the three levels of questions would be very helpful. Hmm I never thought "Fountain Head" was that good. I'm personally reading this philosophical book by Voltaire called "Candide". What are you all guys reading for spring break?
Well I joined you guys here too. I was looking at the AP English Barron's book and it seems that in order to do well on the test we need a lot of just practice of taking the answers and knowing what kind of questions are on the test and how to interpret, it's kind of like SATs or ACTs, you do better on english part with more practice. I hope after spring break we will have a lot of practice on the AP mult choice and some timed writing. The Challenge is to read some good books, I personally recommend "The Fountainhead" by Ayn Rand about individuality, the best book I have read and very inspirational. Also if you want some more background on the Holocaust you might want to read "The Pianist" or rent the movie, which I found to be very powerful, yet disturbing. I find reading literature such as "Night" important to remind myself every so often how superficial our problems are when compared to what people had to undergo during Holocaust, WWI, WWII, and even now around the world. Though I find it ironic to see American propaganda against German Nazis and the genocide directed toward Jews, when arguably Hiroshima and Nagasaki can be viewed as genocide directed toward "Japs." Also the fact that U.S. was supporting Iraq against Iran at the time when Sadaam was gassing Curds is especially interesting since the Kurds genocide is one of the reasons we had the war with Iraq. History is very controversial, especially when put in the context of literature. So yeah, liberty and justice for all (with exceptions to those that are different from "all").
Wait so what's this "Spring Break Challenge" about? It seems to be full of curiosity and contains some imminent surprises......But anyways, I guess for the spring break we just have to read some independent reading novels? Anything else important I missed.....What's the new schedule for after spring break gonna be like?
Thomas, I feel like this has become a dialogue between you and I, not that I'm complaining. It's unfortunate we haven't had as much forced social contact since 8'th Grade Spanish, we sure had good times. Anyway, I wasn't in class for English today, would anyone like to let me know what the "Spring Break Challenge" is? It was mentioned on the syllabus, but haven't heard about it since. Have great breaks everybody! Love, Rob
Wow in suggesting me to perform any kind of fashion or dancing show is like thinking the unthinkable. If that made any sense. But anyways, you certainly have a very interesting humor there Rob....And I'll certainly commend you for spicing this blog up with some humor :) As to breakdancing, do you know who's going to be really good at that......Tyson Cecka. So if you ever have any trouble looking for a good break dancer, Tyson Cekca can do it all for you. And for everybody here, I demand all of you to have an awesome Spring Break!
Haha, sorry about that Tom, hopefully this one only shows up once. We got a new desk for the computer, so maybe some good karma comes with the hardwood. I appreciate your optomism about the assembly, I'm not on the committee so I can just sit back with my fingers crossed and enjoy. Did anyone approach you about being a model??? If not, we'll have you up there next year in the trashiest outfit Anchor Blue has to offer. I can see it now...you'll be strutting your stuff down the runway, stopping, turning, throwing your jacket over your shoulder and giving a sexy, heart stopping look Derek Zoolander himself would be proud of. You're a natural-born star, Tom. Maybe you can guest-star as a breakdancer for the Rick White experience. Love, Rob
Hello all! We've got quite the rousing discussion going on here, and I figured that I should contribute. (Sorry this got half published before, I don't know what happened) I wanted to respond to Ryan E and point out that there have been reports of at least 8,000 and up to 10,000 Iraqi civilians killed in our invasion of their country. I no longer pledge allegiance to our flag. Of course there are many reasons why I no longer pledge allegiance (the false election in 2000; Martha Stewart going to prison while Ken Lay, and countless others, get off; the "defense of marriage act*" +constitutional amendment, the "no child left behind act," and the "patriot act") but the war is a major one right now. I also agree with Rob though. I suppose it's alright if they keep "under god" in our little third period prayer. It really doesn't bother me; when I still said the pledge, I simply left that part out. And yet, the wanted gap between church and state that would justify keeping "under god" (with Rob's argument) isn't always evident. When the president says, "Marriage cannot be severed from its cultural, religious and natural roots..." (2/24/04) I lose confidence in the separation between his religious convictions and his political policies. Here's a site that put the war into perspective: http://www.infoshout.com/the_toll.htm ...Liberty and justice for all, eh? *AHH! How can they use words like "defense" and "protection" when all you need is $54 to get a license? No proof of love, no plan of action for good intentions, just some cash and a couple signatures. http://www.thestranger.com/2004-03-11/city4.html ~Beck Nelson~
Hahahaha, Ok, Rob, you realize you have three of the same posts up. That's ok. You can re-enforce your point of view to other people just in case they missed your point on the first post....they have the second and the third post to remind themselves of your arguments. :) Oh yeah and about the assembly, I'm so sad that I can't be there tomorrow, because of the NorthWest Science Expo, I'm sure it will be awesome.
First of all, let me start off by saying that I have no problem with mandatory repetition of the Pledge of Allegiance because it stands for becoming INDIVISIBLE in an effort against conformity...promotes LIBERTY- the liberty to think, act, and live without government intervention...as well as JUSTICE FOR ALL- the permission for everyone to live as they please. It may be ironic that there is a uniform method of promoting the liberties that lead to diversity, but if everyone is made different through the same process, are they not still different? I recognize the recitation of the Pledge alludes to military service as flags are used to determine a soldier's allegiance in war, but I also believe that the Pledge is more effective with a visual aid. The debate today is whether or not "under GOD" should or even COULD be allowed to stay in the Pledge. I outlined the current particulars of today's case in a previous post, if you haven't read them. To me, this is a case defining the separation of church and state. Although this country was outlined around that seperation, there is nothing that states that government can't recognize the ideology of monotheism, or other belief structure, as long as it doesn't allow the government of religion to directly affect it. One could argue that excluding the possibility of a deity's existence would be not seperating the state from atheist ideology. Tom C addressed free speach...that each American has the right to say what they want and worship as they please. With compliments to that right, many Americans feel the direct connection between Providence and the success of this country, and that excluding their right to express His influence in relation to the country would antithesize their beliefs. The same issue is currently being presented in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, as an Atheist man argues that with each (socially) mandatory oration of the Pledge, his daughter is taught that her father's beliefs are the wrong ones. As for me, I believe that eliminating it from the Pledge restricts the large portion of Americans who recognize the Glory of God as parallel with the liberties of this country. For those who are polytheistic, "under god" can be translated as recognizing a "higher power" than is visible in daily life. Lastly, for those that don't recognize any supernatural force or deity, "under God" may be substituted with a respectful pause while those who do choose to recognize God do so. My views have been presented, but I'm all about becoming as educated as I can on the attitudes toward the aspects of life that effect the way we live every day... so school me! If "Night" is a good read, then I'm all for it...especially if it's short! Also, are Rip Van Winkle, The Grapes of Wrath, or The Catcher in the Rye worth reading over break? Because they all spark my interest. Have a great break, and the fabulous assembly ASB will be presenting Friday morning. Love, Rob
This is a repost, I accidentally posted over an earlier post of mine, so if it appears twice, you now know why. I'm about as tech-smart as the chair I'm sitting on.

Thomas thank you for setting this up. It took a while but I finally got your email. Today is Memorial Day and I was just thinking how much I appreciate all the freedoms and protection we have as Americans. Both of my grandpas went to war. On my mom's side my grandpa served for four or more years and on my dad's side he served for about four years as well. It's crazy to think that they went through so much for us today. It's also weird knowing that someday some of us might take part in a war. I just wanted to get my first post out and see what other people thought about on Memorial Day. GOD BLESS!
Ok, just in case you have not realized, I've completely changed our AP English website for the better. There is a "contributing members" section on the sidebar that allows us to look at our AP English friend's blogging profiles. And I've added two things: 1: The title bar: The title bar serves to better organize our blogs by forcing everyone of us to post the topic we will be discussing in our posts. Thus people will know exactly what the post is for w/o reading sometimes long and tedious posts. 2: Comment option for every post. Hey, if you feel somebody's got a very interesting, or hilarious, or horrible post, feel free to write some comments about that peculiar post. THANKS ALL MY FRIENDS! Thomas
As the year winds down, I want to give some love to the class, especially everyone that posts. We've had some good times, and I think it would be both mentally beneficial as well as fun to continue blog participation through the summer. Pat, your essay was inspiring. I'll be interested to see how the follow-through manifests itself this summer. Look forward to raisin some philanthropic funds at the fireworks tent across from Blackjack. To all you potential fireworks buyers this July, Support The Fort! Blackjack has some good advertising and stuff, but it's run by some weird ass people, I know from experience. Natalya, I hope your experience doesn't support the thesis you've generated from TEWWG. I won't deny that some fellas have very rigid beliefs as to how a woman deserves to be treated, but don't let that discourage any of you fine young women. There are plenty of GOOD guys to go around. A little format note; I've always wondered how publishing companies created the extended dash, but I've figured it out! (I have a bloody iMac, so I'm not sure about this on Windows, but...) Holding the option key and shift key, pressing the button in between the 0 and = key produces the punctuation I've long looked for: — (compared to -). This makes me so happy! My essay I wrote easily in one sitting. It was nice to forego a certain amount of literary analysis and focus on personal response because I felt like I was able to get something off my chest. I'll post it if desired, but it's more or less a more personal extension of the post with the long quote. Lastly (this is a very quick-moving post), the Harry Potter story line is nothing new. The classic series'; Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, and even Star Wars have taken the theme of the conflict between Good and Evil and given it a different setting. The story lines each include some standard elements of personal struggle and sacrifice, making the story quite predictable, yet gripping nonetheless. For example, Luke Skywalker must resist the Dark Side of the Force, Frodo frequently expresses the grip he knows the ring has on him, and even Harry Potter fought with himself in his choice of House, ultimately siding against Slytherin's beckoning promise of power. I could make a pretty good guess to the end of the series because they all end very similarly, but I will NOT stop reading them till Voldemort is contained and Harry graduates (or maybe he dies in sacrifice, that OCCASIONALLY happens, but I doubt it in this instance). The key to writing a successful series is the ability to weave reader interaction into a story as Rachel addressed, and equally important, putting a unique spin on the fantastic setting. To reiterate, I love you all Love, Rob
I found Catcher in the Rye to be a bit scary too once I realized that Holden was really mentally unstable. My paper was a parody on Holden and I just hope Mrs. VA won't be too disturbed by the "creativity" of my imagination in this paper. It was actually really fun to explore the thoughts of a potential character like that, I could draw a lot for my writing from my guy-friends and their thoughts that they express verbally, I think I could write a whole book just in that kind of a colloquial style, exploring the different ideas people have in their mind during the day. I ran our of my reading mood, so Their Eyes were Watching God is only half finished for now, but so far my reaction to it is: men are sexist and generally evil, with rare exceptions. That is of course an exaggeration but the feeling I get from the book so far is that men find a girl, get what they want from her, that is love and attachment and then either get bored and move on to another "victim" or exploit the already used and hypnotised girl to fullest potential. I just couldn't believe it how Janie's first husband first begged her to marry him and then went to by her a mule so that she could plow his fields. The same with her second husband Jody who first says: "you behind a plow! You ain't got no mo' business wid uh plow than uh hog is got wid uh holiday! ... A pretty dall-baby lak you is made to sit on de front porch and rock and fan yo'self and eat p'taters dat other folks plant just special for you." It's ridiculous how he very soon placed her behind the counter of his shop and scoundreled her for miscounting. I just wouldn't believe the swift change from adornment to "... you [Janie] need tellin'. Somebody got to think for women and chillun and chickens and cows. I god, they sho don't think none theirselves." I just love the comparison between women and chickens, no wonder the word "chicks" addressed toward girls is still in the lexicon. I want to finish the book though, maybe Tea Cake will bring some optimistic news about the race of men and will lower down my cynicism. I was just wondering if anyone has any ideas about the significance of Janie's beautiful hair and the crazy mule running around. Call me a nerd but I love Harry Potter books, they are just so beyond imagination it's fascinating. They inspire me to write something like that too, only it's hard to come up with new ideas for a story; I think I am going to go think about some potentially successful ideas for a plot, maybe that will get me into Harvard, or at least I could make millions of dollars selling the books and then just bribe the admisions officers;) I think the movies are not that great though. Lord of the Rings series were better and closer to the actual book. These kinds of books are just fun to read in order to get away from the ordinary world, afterall it gets really boring here sometimes and they don't take that long to read becuase they have such straigh-forward ideological content: the good always wins, yet I have to agree with Pat that they are a bit stricky in the story line. I am still struggling with Fountainhead though, that book is insane, the more I read of it the harder it becomes and the more I want to read it.
I don't know about the rest of you, but I would like to read some of the other papers that students have written to see different perspectives on the topics. I will share mine, it was based on The Great Gatsby, and I chose the second prompt that concerned how the book has influenced our beliefs....read mine but I would really like to read others papers so please share. A Positive Influence on My Beliefs I have been raised to believe in the importance of Christian values that have shaped me into the moral person I am today. After reading The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald and encountering the degradation of values concerning upper-class society in the 1920’s, I have been influenced to strengthen my moral values. Fitzgerald’s novel is portrayed through a description of two wealthy Long Island communities where the center of attention is the Gatsby mansion where “The Great Gatsby” holds his famous parties where Fitzgerald focuses his novel on the characters of Tom and Daisy Buchanan and Nick Carraway(the narrator). Fitzgerald uses the beliefs of these characters to mock and show the beliefs of 1920’s upper-class society. Jay Gatsby is an “Oxford man” who, after fighting in World War I becomes fabulously wealthy through criminal business to pursue his love-Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby is portrayed as a mysterious figure who everyone admires for his extravagant amount of wealth. Gatsby’s attitude toward money is shown in a quote that is taken from a flashback on Gatsby’s life stating “To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world.” The authors reasoning for showing the materialistic attitude is for the reader to make the connection of how money can corrupt one’s thinking. Gatsby, like many other characters in the novel, is so engrossed in wealth that it seems to be the sole thing that gives him satisfaction in his life. Gatsby’s obsession with wealth is nothing compared to the attitude of Daisy Buchanan, a longtime lover of Gatsby. Daisy Buchanan is not interested in love, but completely in material possessions. Daisy’s attitude is best described in a quote when Daisy is admiring en extensive collection of Gatsby’s shirts. She states, “They’re such beautiful shirts,’ she sobbed, her voice muffled in thick folds. ‘It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such-such beautiful shirts before.” Fitzgerald is able to portray a multitude of character insights in this small quote. First and foremost Fitzgerald is depicting Daisy as a fool for being so engrossed in a collection of shirts. Also, the author gives insight as to what Daisy’s true love is-wealth. Daisy married her husband Tom because he had money, not because she loved him as a person. Tom knows what Daisy’s true love is, and in response began an affair with a woman in the city. Fitzgerald uses Daisy’s attitude and the relationship between Tom and Daisy to show the corrupt beliefs of upper-class marriages during this time period. Fitzgerald is saying that upper-class marriages weren’t based upon love-but two selfish people getting what they, without regard to morals. While most the characters are immersed in materialism, Nick Carraway has contrasting beliefs. Nicks beliefs are based upon morals, not money. In the end of the novel, Nick makes the decision to move away from the upper-class society of the East, and move back to the Midwest where morality is more important than money. Nick describes his decision when saying “...the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry on the line I decided to come back home.” Nick makes a decision to get away from what he knows will influence him and eventually corrupt his beliefs. Through analyzing the beliefs of these characters, my own personal beliefs have been influenced greatly. Fitzgerald’s portrayal of a corrupt upper-class society made me realize that I am so very fortunate and that I take for granted the wealth that I am immersed in. I am far from a Daisy Buchanan, but am still caught up in material possessions from time to time. After reading this book, I am sickened that the upper-class in this book wasted their lives living a life where they were unable to love one another normally because they were so greatly influenced by material possessions. What is the point in having an extravagant shirt collection? Where is the need to host a party every weekend that leads to a myriad of people being plastered with alcohol. It is a complete waste that I don’t ever want to be a part of. I have developed such strong beliefs from reading this book that instead of spending my money on upgrading my car this summer, it will go towards something useful. I am so very glad I read this book, for it opened my eyes to what is really important in life and that is not possessions, it is giving back when I have the ability to share my wealth. SO THERES MY PAPER.......WHAT DO Y'ALL THINK?
First of all, I have to say that Pat you couldn't explain Harry Potter any better. Something about the plot captivates the reader, but I have never stopped to think about what it could be... How could I when I wasn't even able to stop to put them down? Being a person that has read all of the Harry Potter books countless numbers of times, everytime I read them I pick up on another clue that has a link to a later point in the plot. You don't even understand how excited I was to realize that Moony, was because he was a wearwolf, Wormtail was because he was a rat and had a tail like a worm, Padfoot the dog, and Prongs was the stag. I seriously set down my book and was amazed... Maybe it was a little more obvious for others, but when different things in the book all of a sudden click and come together and you get the feeling that a light bulb just came on, its irreplaceable. That's why these books are good for all ages, younger kids wouldn't necessairly make all of the connections but the mere plot and setting of a magical place that all of us wish we could be a part of would be enough to draw them in. While adults and teenagers are able to make all of the small connections that makes for a thrilling read. As you can tell, I'm absolutly in love with Harry Potter, and June 4th is marked on my calender! I can't even wait... Now for a more serious side, Ryan I can see exactly what you mean about Their Eyes Were Watching God. It definitly focuses on how money and status are not everything in a relationship and you can't "buy" love. Although it's always said, but it's true, love only comes on its own. Janie could have had anything she wanted when she was with Jody, but the love was not there. However when she was with Tea Cake and didn't have a big house and everything else she was never happier. It just goes to show that love is the most important part of relationships and nothing can replace it. - Rachel Penny
The most respected black writer of the Harlem Renaissance, Richard Wright, said of Zora Neale Hurston’s novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, “[it] carries no theme, no message, no thought,” and after reading the novel for myself I came to the conclusion that Mr. Wright’s perspective and preformed filters limited his ability to perceive the delicate and emotional subtleties of the story. Their Eyes Were Watching God records one woman’s pursuit of love, a venture which is beautifully complex and unexpectedly educational. Unlike a majority of black writers in the 1930s who created serious, in-your-face literature, Hurston chose to write a novel that extended beyond the black protest tradition and connected with readers on a level unaffected by race or gender. Hurston does not blatantly broadcast an image of black struggle as her early critics would have preferred; instead, she unfurls a story, revealing intricacies of love and emotion that many men are never privy to. Although writers such as Richard Wright believe love to be trivial in comparison to the awareness of black oppression, Hurston’s novel should be commended for discussing unique and unexplored topics. Their Eyes challenges the notion that riches and status alone can attract a woman to a man, and reinforces the message that a man must respect a woman for her mind for a relationship to be truly fulfilling. The emotional journey of Janie Crawford, the female protagonist, encouraged me to believe that true love is attainable through perseverance, and that the tragedy of loss is outweighed by the memories of time spent with a soul mate.

Hi everyone! I have finally been given permission to post on our class blog. I just wanted to make a quick post and say hello. The Catcher In The Rye was a quick, and enjoyable read. I thought this book was very depressing, which, I'm sure, is a shared opinion between those of us who have read it. Holden, the main character, scared me quite a bit. Throughout his decline, I began to notice quite a lot of similarities between he and I; this is scary because Holden loses control of his life. I'm curious to find what other people's opinions are of this book, and if they felt any connection with Holden.
I've mentioned how much I enjoyed the Da Vinci Code on this blog before and Pat's post about Harry Potter is similar to how the Da Vinci Code is affecting adults. The book isn't too long, and isn't hard to read, but it's not a ground breaking novel either. The subject matter I think is what has made the book so popular at first glance. Everyone knows about the Holy Grail legend, Leonardo Da Vinci, and secret societies. The success of the book builds upon itself, like Harry Potter, word of mouth causes a snowball effect on popularity. But I digress, I just hope the movie is as good as the book.
With the approach of the latest Harry Potter movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban, I would like to take some time to reflect upon arguably the personally fulfilling series of books I have read. (Don't laugh, I know all of you read these books.....and love them) First of all, the genius of J.K. Rowling is her organization. How many times have you been reading these books and come across a turn in the plot, and then remembered hearing a small clue earlier in the book or in a past book that led directly to a crucial part in the book. To clarify that last statement I will give some examples. EX 1: Harry has to live with the Dursleys-find out later this gives him protection when he's away from Hogwarts. EX 2: Ron's rat Scabbers-find out later it is Wormtail, supporter of Voldemort who framed Sirius and lived with Ron and his family to be able to hear news from the wizarding world concerning Voldemorts whereabouts/possible return. While the plot is deeply woven for a simple children's novel, this is not the only reason for the success of these books. What makes these books so wildy popular is the way in which the reader is so captivated by the setting of a wizarding world in which spells and flying is a reality. What kid could resist a fantasy like this? I sure couldn't. I am 17 years old and am still spellbound(pun). I have talked to adults that are more obsessed than I am. If anyone caught last weeks TRL on MTV is was all about Harry Potter and kids dressed up in robes and competed to get a role on the next Harry Potter film. One girl participating was able to name the license plate number of the Weasley's car in the second movie.....that is seriously ridiculous. Speaking of ridiculous, the winner was a kid about our age who literally was jumping up and down, crying with joy after he won the contest. I'm sorry but after reading Benjamin Franklin's autobiography I was hardly jumping up and down with joy.(I am not bashing Benjamin Franklin-just pointing out how a setting can contribute to the joy of reading a novel) So now that I have gone off on a tangent, I would like to hear from anyone else that has been so engrossed in the novels as I have. Call me obsessive, I don't even care. Read the books-then call me obsessive. Yes, these novels will probably not help you get into an Ivy League school but don't we deserve a treat after all the reading we have done this year? Like William Forrester said on Finding Forrester, "I read the Times for a main dish, and the tabloids for a dessert" Go on, treat yourself. Or even better, start an argument against me. I would love to hear it. -Pat
I'm 100% in favor of isolating and analyzing those philosophical quotes in the hearts of novels. My favorite (besides "my mother is a fish") in As I Lay Dying comes from the woman who lays dying. The quote comes at the end of a chapter that deals with the nature of words- how words and names are used to describe emotions and feelings but they're always insufficient if there isn't first hand knowledge of the experience that the word's trying to describe. As an example... "I would think Anse (the name of her husband). Why Anse. Why are you Anse. I would think about his name until after a while I could see the word as a shape, a vessel, and I would watch him liquify and flow into it like cold molasses flowing out the darkness into a vessel, until the jar stood full and motionless: a significant shape profoundly without life like an empty door frame; and then I would find that I had forgetten the name of the jar. I would think: The shape of my body where I used to be a virgin is in the shape of a and I couldn't think ANSE, couldn't remember ANSE. It was not that I could think of myself as no longer unvirgin, because I was three now (had three kids now). And when I would think CASH and DARL (the names of her first two children) that way until their names would die and solidify into a shape and then fade away, I would say, All right. It doesn't matter what they call them. "And so when Cora Tull would tell me I waas not a true mother, I would thinnk how words go straight up in a thin line, quick and harmless, and how terribly doing goes along the earth, clinging to it, so that after a while the two lines are too far apart for the same person to straddle from one to the other; and that sin and love and fear are just sound that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forget the words. Like Cora who could never even cook." Sorry for the long intro- but keeping that attitude towards words in mind, comprehend the significance of the quote I really wanted to address. "One day I was talking to Cora. She prayed for me because she believed I was blind to sin, wanting me to kneel and pray too, (this is the big part) because people to whom sin is just a matter of words, salvation is just a matter of words too." I read it as questioning a lot of peoples' grasp on religion. Sinners who believe that sin is just in words miss the meaning of words, miss the meaning of sin. Addie really does know sin, she has a child from a man outside her marriage and holds resentment towards her whole family as well as God. I think this is a quote that can have a lot of interpretation, so think about it and post your thoughts. Love Rob
Catcher in the Rye is such a comfortable read and a great book that many of us at this age can relate to. Even with Holden's very personal, eclectic ideas, interrupted and day-dreaming like train of thoughts, my brain can somehow feel a connection. And actually this personal and colloquial style is what really makes this book engaging, interesting, and awesome. I feel like I can easily follow Holden's train of thoughts, even when he daydreams from one seemingly unrelated topic to another. That's just how the human brain thinks. Salinger constructed such a real, believable teenager figure. Finally, as Paul advertised so nicely, besides the great New York Times, there is also the great magazine New Yorker everyone should read. Especially in the May 23rd edition in which there was the famous article "The Gray Zone" written by Seymour Hersh probing the secret interrogation agencies and facillities that were in widespread use. All of these abuses we are witnissing today directly relates to the intentional or unintentional commands from the Pentagon (including Rumsfeld himself). But yeah, read this famous article "The Gray Zone" by Seymour Hersh.
Holden reminds me a lot of someone who's eyes aren't open to the real world. He's had his life handed to him by his parents, and no doubt while he loves them a lot of his frustrations are coming from a lack of direction. He's been directed all his life and he struggles to be who he wants to be. Because he's never worked for anything he doesn't understand the value of anything and throws away his extremely valuable education and life his well to do parents have given him. He judges people and fails to make successful relationships because he's placed arbitrary value in some unimportant things. However I feel Holden has a kind heart, and that counts for a lot. He's simply, uninformed to say the worst, and is a bit odd. For me, the character makes sense, and I do find the book extremely memorable, much more so than many other novels I've read. I find the conciseness of the book commendable, Orwell's philosophy of saying what you need to say without the fluff is philosophy now too. Have a nice day bloggers- Don't be a (NY) Post Monkey, read the Times and evolve www.nytimes.com
I actually really like the prompts that we have for the writing assignment, they give a lot to write about. I am going to write a parody on Catcher in the Rye, the book itself provides a lot of ideas to write about. I think one of the major problems with olden is in his believe that people do things for the wrong reasons: not because it's what they want to do, but because it's what everyone else wants them to do. He expresses it in this quote about lawyers: "Even if you did go around saving guys' lives and all, how would you know if you did it because you really wanted to save guys' lives, or because you did it because what you really wanted to do was be a terrific lawyer, with everybody slapping you on the back and congratulating you in court when the goddam trial was over...?" And I find that to be true for myself, I sometimes wonder if I want to go to a great school like Harvard just because it's a famous school and it will look good on my resume or because I believe that I will actually learn better and enjoy studying there; I have to admit though that often the answer is: I like the name a lot, sounds big and important:( I was also looking at this quote by Mr. Antolini in the book : "If you go along with it [academic edu.] considerable distance, it'll give you an idea what size mind you have. What it'll fit and, maybe, what it won't. After a while you'll have an idea what kind of thoughts your particular size mind should be wearing." I just happen to really disagree with this quote, just because I am against any kind of parameters set on a human mind and consciousness, I believe that there is no limit to our ability to learn and understand new ideas, and so there shouldn't ever be such thing as a "size mind" ... do you like it small, large, or supersize? I like to analyze different "smart" quotes from books, gives you something to ponder about.
Ryan, I agree that more guys should read Their Eyes Were Watching God. Men and women have different perspectives on life and think completely differently. However I think Their Eyes Were Watching God allows the reader to get inside the mind of a women and how they view relationships. This could be very benefical for guys that read it to understand how women think... It's also a good book besides that and isn't the "girl power" book you would think it would be. I highly recommend it.
Pat, I agree with you that Gatsby is a success as a story critical of the society during the 20s, but the only analogy I can make to the book is that of a turkey that is served for Thanksgiving dinner, it doesn't have its feathers and it doesn't look as beautiful as it did when it was alive but it's still a bird, so is this book, it has a story but it lacks the "feathers" - it lacks commentary and reflections of the author; it's just a story with a very interesting plot and a straight-forward message of society being corrupted and fake. And it's true that maybe the story doesn't need the extraneous ornaments but it's just much more engaging to see what the author himself has to say about the story, it creates a conversation as you read the book between you and Fitzgerald. Rob, sorry but I didn't find AILD yet, so I started on Their eyes were watching God, but I will get to it as soon as I find the book. You should start though on Fountainhead, that book is really hard to read, partly because it has so much philosophy and such a complicated plot in it. But you definitely should read it, I really need someone to discuss it with:( Discussing Catcher in the Rye today helped a lot, there were a lot of things that I haven't even realized as I read the book, such as for example the fact that Holden ends up in a mental hospital or that he is crazy all along in the story. As I read the book I had this feeling that he was a bit strange, but because the book was written as his own personal thoughts I just took it for normal that his mind wondered all over, I sort of think we all have that in our mind where we think of random thinks during the day once in a while. I also heard a lot of criticism of the character, but I still believe that he is a really nice person that has just come to a state of dissatisfaction with the society around him; he does exaggerate a lot and he seems to be critical of everyone and everything he sees, but it sounds like it all comes from bitterness and depression of his character. Maybe he wants to be a catcher in the rye because he knows that there is no one else to catch him if he were to jump off a cliff. It's strange how the more I think about him the more depressed I become myself. Ducks are lucky, they can just fly away whenever it gets too cold ...
If love is a battlefield as Pat Benatar famously said, then Their Eyes Were Watching God is a top secret report addressed to the Female Commander that was intercepted and expressed mailed to the Male General. Zora Neale Hurston writes about a woman named Janie searching for her soul mate and finding a few duds along the way. In the process, Hurston provides insight into the female perspective in a way I've never encountered. When women speak of love it seems as though they carefully construct a model of an ideal relationship, but the honest solitude of writing allows Hurston to leak key secrets about the art of war/love. A recurring metaphor in the novel compares perfect love to the blossom of a pear tree, and through the exploits of Janie, the protagonist, the author defines the love blossom as a relationship in which a man treats a woman as his equal and respects her mind, all the while making her glow from every fingertip and toe. Easier said than done? Absolutely, but Their Eyes chronicles the mistakes of foolish men, writing a virtual how-not-to book on love. I feel I'm a more complete person after reading it because I attained a deeper understanding of female emotion and compassion. I believe Their Eyes is a book that should be read by all men because it teaches how women feel and why they feel the way they do, key bits that are rarely divulged and usually left to be deciphered through telepathy, a skill that few of us poor saps are granted. Zora Neale Hurston's novel may be about encountering womanhood, but it’s a worthwhile read for everyone because it demystifies the differences between the sexes and could possibly save or prevent a future dysfunctional marriage. -By: Ryan Elliott PS - I had no idea anyone could think as beautifully as Hurston does in this book
I'm coming to the end tonight Beck, but there is certainly no doubt in my mind that each one of those Bundren's is crazier than the next. I certainly enjoyed kickin it w/ you and the crew at Mr. Skyview, and I'd like to commend Divcom for raising 6 g's for Make a Wish Foundation. Natalya; Fountainhead is Ayn Rand, is it not? I'll read it if you read AILD and we'll have a two book discussion going on. Pat, I'm in agreement w/ you about Gatsby. One of my favorites of the year... I really enjoyed a fictional approach to social commentary. Not really satire, but 100% effective- a challenge to the alcohol consuming socialites who had lost the traditional values of the turn of the century. It's a direct insult to those who live that life. And the whole time there is the allusion to "big brother" with the doctor's eyes. My take is that although the socialites attempted to cover their moral discrepencies in speakeasies and private parties, it was clear to everyone what was really going on. Just a thought, no evidence to back it up, but I think it sounds good. One month of school left!!! Love Rob
Who says The Great Gatsby is a boring book? I have heard that from countless people who have seen me reading the book and its not true. The novel, like other successful American Lit. novels, criticizes society through the experiences of a narrator that is a central character in the novel. The Great Gatsby criticizes the "roaring twenties" by depicting the upper class' lifestyle that consists of breaking prohibition laws, having affairs, and murder. Throughout the book I felt a sense of this lifestyle that I can only describe as "hollow." That may not make sense, but it seemed to me as if the novel showed the upper class as not having a role in society, just partying and living a life that didn't have a significant meaning. Going back to my thought on how this novel is successful due to its criticism of society, I can draw many similairities between this novel and Huckelberry Finn. Both novels consisted of a central character that had the role of the narrator, both mocked society of the time period, and both novels a relationship between the narrator and another central character that grew as the novel progressed-both resulting in the parting of these two characters at the climax of the novel. Maybe there are some other thoughts on this novel.....anyone? -Pat
Okay, I just finished "the catcher in the rye" and I don't quite know what to make of it. This blog entry will double as somewhat of a discovery process (hopefully) for me and I will hopefully be able to come to some sort of conclusion about some aspect of the book. If I begin to ramble I apologize. First I'd like to talk about the significance of the title. When his sister asked him what he liked I was anxious to hear his answer. Immediately he ponders some off-the-topic idea and comes back to the topic after his sister says, "You can't even think of one thing." He responds with, "Yes, I can. Yes, I can." He than talks about his brother and the enjoyment he gets out of talking to his sister. These things he comes up with are so simple. Then he tells about how he simply wants to be a catcher in the rye. I like the connection Natalya made with the James Castle and the "catcher" Holden. This seems like one of many intricate connections that Salinger makes. Finally I think the title signifies he wants a simple life with a simple purpose. Now I finally see the connection with his displeasure with "phonies." Phonies to Holden suggest some sort of unneeded attention aimed at bettering the perception other people have on them. This adds to the idea that he wants a simple life that is not fake and that has a purpose. Obviously one can see that being "phony" has no "real" purpose. This contributes to his dislike of the idea. One thing I noticed was the abrupt conclusions Holden comes to when looking at different situations in his life. It's hard to find examples, a few off the top of my head are: the inferiority complex and the conceited men, the kids always having to meet their friends and the yearbook handsomeness. He even ends his story with a simple conclusion of his. Hmm... That was somewhat helpful for me. I hope I didn't sound like a rambling idiot. Oh yeah, does anyone see the significance with the ducks? ~Frank
I'm reading "AILD" as well, Rob, and i quite agree; it is fascinating. Have you got the end yet? It's CRAZY. Sort of.... unexpected anyway. Mrs VA introduced the book by telling us that the Bundren family was simply unintelligent ("really stupid," i think she said) but i've come to a different understanding of them. (No offense to Mrs VA - I was just using you as a handy introduction-type idea). Anse is the only person in the book who strikes me as truley stupid, but i think his stupidity comes from his country stubborness and pride. The rest of them are pretty much just pure crazy as opposed to dumb. Cash pulls through in the end as the sanest of the bunch - too bad his leg is rotted off. I think that Darl's developement is very interesting; his narrations retain some of his characteristic vocabulary, but he is badly cracked by the end. And i see what you're saying (Rob) about Vardaman's run on excitement, but i think it runs right on through to insanity. (conclusion) -Beck-
Hey Rob, I am going to start As I lay Dying tomorrow, I'm not sure if we will have any more time for discussions, but I would certainly love to talk about the book. Discussions are great, as long as people are interested in talking about a book. I personally recommend everyone to read "Fountainhead." Every time I come back to reading this book it elevates me to a totally different level of understanding of life, it's so crazy, it's like a philosophy book but the only philosophy is in the lives of the people that are in the book, I mean it's just great! You have to read it, there are no words of explanation for this masterpiece. People "die with every day that passes. When you meet them, they're not what you met last. In any given hour, they kill some part of themselves. They change, they deny, they contradict - and the call it growth. At the end there's nothing left, nothing unreversed or unbetrayed; as if there had never been an entity, only a succession of adjectives fading in and out on an unformed mass."
I'm glad everyone has found a book that's suited them for this most recent project. Having read both Gatsby and Catcher, I find it kind of fun to play along as you get to know Holden and slowly resent 20's life. Right now I'm reading As I Lay Dying, and it's like nothing I've ever read before. The style is insanely unique (albeit a little difficult to get used to) as Faulkner switches narrators from one miserable member of the Bundren family to another with each passing chapter. Faulkner gives real personality to the characters not by description, per se, but by narrating as they think. For instance, Vardaman is the youngest of the characters, and his narration is distinct for his simple vocab and run on sentences that accurately depict the excitement of a child. Darl on the other hand is viewed as a deep thinker so his vocab is more expansive and Faulkner really tries to play around with language and philosophy under the pretense of death. While I rejoice that my classmates enjoy their respective novels, I'm slightly disappointed I have but one compatriot that can share the sentiments of my novel. If you have some free time this summer, AILD will keep your mind engaged. Keep up the great work as the instinctual countdown in your brains approaches june 23! Love Rob
Hey Nova, thanx for joining us, it's been getting rather quiet here lately.... The Great Gatsby is not that great after all, I guess it's just not my kind of "great literature." First I though I was missing something in the book, but now I think that it's the but the book that's missing something... The author states his doctrine on the first page: "whenever you feel like criticizing anyone... just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had," which dictates the rest of the book making it "lack" any kind of criticism expressed by the narrator or any "reflections" upon the issues raised by the actions of characters in the book. He simply leaves it all for the reader to interpret and draw her/his own conclusions. I understand that's great in the fact that it makes you think for yourself about what you read instead of just reading off the dogmas that the author provides you with layed out on a silver plate. But my problem is that I need someone to discuss the book with, even if it be the author himself through the context of the "sophisticated sentences" he writes down in his book, or his thoughts. That's why I think I liked Catcher in the Rye so much more, the author just told you everything he thought, even though all the digressions could sometimes get distracting. It's strange how the book just gives you three days of this boy's life but you know everything about his character you could ever find out. I first thought he was rather sardonic and just negative in general toward life and people, all of his comments and criticism, but toward the end of the book I couldn't help but love this boy. The way he just tells his little sister how he wants to be a catcher in the rye.. "standing on the edge of some crazy cliff... I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff...I have to come out from somewhere and catch them..." and just makes you feel like you know that he would have caught that boy that jumped out of the window and that he would have kept that young girl from selling her body and that he would have donated all of his money to those two nuns if he could... just the simple things he says and does make him so unrealistically true and "good"... I am trying though to figure out what is the significance of the carousel at the end of the book... why does it make him so happy?
Hello all. It's Nova. How is everyone's book going for them? The Great Gatsby is pretty good. I thought it would be boring but I actually got into the story, although some parts of it were confusing. The people in our discussion group were having a hard time trying to figure out Dr. T.J. Eckleberg. Does he represent God? Nick? Or just a random billboard, watching everything? Anyone have any ideas? Also, we had a group consensus that we dislike Tom and Mrs. Wilson (well, mostly a consensus). I have to go, but I'll come back later! Bye
Like Corey, I am also reading Their Eyes Were Watching God. I really enjoy reading it. It's more relaxing of a read opposed to having to analyze a piece for rhetorical strategies. It's nice to have no pressure after the AP tests and be rewarded for spending the first three fourths of the year challenging ourselves and preparing for the "big test."
The blog's been rather quiet lately. I'm finding the catcher in the rye an easy and memorable read. I personally find the characters very realistic, especially Holden, I enjoy how the entire book is simply living the life of somebody who's our age, but engrossing simply because Salinger paints such an accurate portrait. But I'm not hearing unanimous agreement from others, since people in my small group are finding different views of the book. But what's really on my mind isn't the catcher in the rye, for me it's the aftermath of the ISEF fair. Aside from meeting kids who I'm sure will be extremely successful before they're 30, I saw a group of 4 of them on my favorite business commentator's show, Lou Dobbs, talking about their projects tonight. I wish I could accomplish as much as they have already. I'm having the hardest time finding a good idea which real practical applications. Getting started is always hardest but I digress. I just feel like there is so much any of us could be accomplishing and I hate feeling like a sponge. But there's always next year! Or this summer I should say! -Read a real newspaper, go to www.nytimes.com
Hey everyone whats up? I like how we are ending the year with fun reading and basic skills about research and other things, after taking the AP test it should be this way. I am reading Their Eyes were Watching God, it is a really good book and I highly reccomend it, because it's a story that tells of a woman who had tough relationships, and you may know people like this girl, and eventually meets this awesome guy named Tea Cake, I mean with a name like that why wouldn't you want to read the book. -Corey Furin-
I personally think everyone should congratulate Rob for his 2nd place at MUN this Saturday! He really did a great job and it is thanx to him that our team got all the first places:) And I invite everyone to join our club, you never know what hidden talents you have. Going on to Gatsby, I see the irony of Gatsby's "friends" not even coming to his funeral and the fact that his beloved Daisy runs off and he has to pay for her mistake with his own life. The scenes of the party in his house are truly what the 20s were like for the elite and give me just a general visual of pigs partying in dirt, a feeling of disgust. Also disturbing is the fact that Tom's mistress Myrtle is like that puppy he bought for her on the street, and that he can throw her away as easily as that puppy. I loved the description of women of that time as elegant and mysterious which then created a special contrast with their greed for money and superficial expression of love. I mean I see a lot of themes going on in the book and they are quite obviously related to materialism, but it feels like there is something missing in it, like it's too easy or maybe I just expected too much from the book after hearing all these great things about it. I liked the book, but I don't feel like it changed my life or like it is a masterpiece of literature.
Hey Rob, in response to your welcome to me as to returning to the "real world", I have a few words to say. Forgive me if I sound like a nerdy bigot here. First of all, I have to say that yes, certainly, I've got your note you so graciously left on my exhibit booth. I have to thank with my deepest appreciation to all and everyone who came to visit Intel ISEF on Thursday or Friday. With all the scientific jargons EVERYWHERE in the beloved ISEF exhibits hall that would probably intimidate a good deal of people just with their first step into the ISEF exhibit hall, yes I do agree the environment I was immersed in for the past whole week is out of touch with the "rest of the society". But on a different note, we had the wonderful opportunity to meet people from ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD.....We were chatting about not just what scientific discoveries, methods, projects we worked on over the past years, but we ISEF finalists also discussed politics (yeah discussing politics with people from other countries is kinda interesting), our hometowns, schools, and just our personal nerdy lives in general. We also have had LOTS AND LTOS OF SOCIAL LIFE....more social life in the past week than I've ever had in my life. Just being in the convention center makes you feel more mature, and everything was in adult settings and business attires. All the strict rules, politeness, civilness in conjunction with meeting professors, Nobel Laureates, leading scientists and teachers of all fields that represent modern society. True, all of these cameras, press, Nobel laureates are probably very special, but these famous people (both adults and ISEF students) I met do constitute part of our world and the contributions of the scientists is what move the society forward, not the verbatim politicians. Besides, I'd rather be in a environment of overly academicness, formalness, and overly famous people to see what really the world of brainpower is like than be in an environment that encourages some kind of phobia to academia and modern sciences (We had some fun times chuckling and making fun of Bush on the bureaucracy and the political barriers to modern science advances, such as the stem cell research, and it was started by Nobel Laureates) YEAH SO ISEF ALL THE WAY....5000 times more REAL WORLD! lol. And now I'm looking forward to catch up all the work I've missed the past week lol. Catcher in the Rye seems to be a very comfortable reading right now. I've looking forward to discussing the book with other interested readers.
Wow, it's been a few days since I last checked the blog and I feel so out of touch... so I have some preambulatory clauses to address before I get to the real, English-related topic of the post. First and foremost, I'd like to CONGRATULATE the members of Skyview MUN for their various awards and other successes at the district tournament this weekend, RECOGNIZING the efforts of the Russian Federation in successfully warding off the political opposers of the Rodina FURTHER RECOGNIZING that said efforts resulted in both best team in General Assembly as well as best team overall and, LOOKS FORWARD TO seeing the big ass trophy that results I really had a good time and look forward to participating in the future. Secondly, Thomas, welcome back to the real world. I hope you got my note when I went to visit you and you weren't there, but if you didn't, I came to support the scientific mind Natalya has recognized as a Hottie. Now to the Great Gatsby... I feel like a major nerd here, but I really enjoyed the book and feel I was able to track the author and accompanying symbolism. (This is where I feel like a nerd) I would therefore like to reference the independent reading report I did on it earlier on in the year; The Great Gatsby is considered the great American novel because below the cloak of an extravagant love story is the erosion of American society in the Roaring 20’s, or “Jazz Age,” as Fitzgerald dubbed it. Gatsby himself is the symbol of the American dream as Fitzgerald saw it: he’s rich and therefore a socialite, he throws lavish parties where hundreds of “friends” come to his mansion to glorify the vices of society, namely alcohol and sex, and he pursues unrealistic fantasies on a whim, attempting to bend reality to fit his sensibilities. Gatsby’s love interest, Daisy, is respectable and accountable, besides being desirable. When Gatsby tries to woo Daisy, and runs into obstacles, it is apparent in Gatsby’s demeanor that the American lifestyle is unraveling, as demonstrated in his cessation of party hosting. In the end, when Gatsby’s protection of Daisy results in his death, it is apparent at his funeral when none of his “friends” come to mourn how the American lifestyle is truly viewed; as base, vile, and taboo. Long story short, Gatsby was symbolic of the twenties life-style, (as AP US History should have taught you) a life-style that Fitzgerald was against. Viewing Gatsby as an embodiment of the Roaring 20's may alter your position toward him and his actions as you read. Some other interesting symbolism was the role of the Green Light that was Gatsby's hope in reuniting with Daisy, and the role of the Dr.'s Eyes. I really really enjoyed Gatsby, so if anyone who is reading it wishes to discuss it extracurricularly, I'd love to participate. I'd also like to note that Faulkner's As I Lay Dying is an entirely different style than I believe I've encountered before, and the humor and complexity of the book make it a lot of fun as well. I love that post AP test, there is still so much interest in American Lit. Love Rob
HEY MS.VA AND ALL MY AP ENGLISH FRIENDS!!!!!!!!! I just would like to say that Thomas Chen had had the wonderful opportunity to experience through one of the best week in his life. Intel International Science and Engineering Fair is truly world class and the experience once in a life opportunity. The awards and free stuff we got were only a temporary excitement, but the most valuable experience was making great friends from all 50 states and 40 countries around the world!!!!!! It's 100% probable that one or two friends you make in ISEF will be in the future leaders of the world, billionaires, or Nobel Laureates. The country and state pin exchanges, the plethora of ISEF ceremonies, all the social events were truly amazing. Furthermore, we the ISEF competitors got to be in a press like room with the Nobel Laureates as a panel. We were like the press asking the prestigious Nobel Laureates questions and they would answer us right there. It was truly astounding. Yeah I guess the most important idea I've learned and experienced through this ISEF event is that seriously, there are sooooooooooooooo much talents and brainpower out there in the world, even with the everyday person around us. The project I did was just one grain of sand morphed into this vast lake of sand dunes stretching thousands of miles. All the 1400 projects there were simply impressive. I wil see everyone on Monday. Thomas Chen
I agree with you Natalya. The ending of "The Great Gatsby" left me hanging also. I feel like I missed some hidden messages or themes. Mr. Selby, my ASL teacher, said he loved the book and that it made such an impact on him... Yeah, I think I'm missing something. I liked Fitzgerald's imagery throughout the book. It was really amazing. There were some very beautiful passages. I need to do some discussing with my group.
I just got back from the Talent Show and I was really impressed by the last song by the White Bros, piano and violin really made it just ... special, so props for Ben Perry and Matt Wu. Sorry Rob, but Matt WU is way hotter than Thomas, although I have to agree that Thomas by all parameters is qualified for the title of a hottie. I just finished "The Great Gatsby" today and I have kind of mixed feelings toward the book. I have heard a lot of people say good things about it and on the back of the book it says "American masterpiece" but my question is: what is the point of the book? I just feel dumb right now cause I didn't really find an actual point, or an underlined message or some "truth" or a "revelation." The book was really well written and was engaging, I thought it was great from the very beginning, but I somehow expected more from it and I guess the end just threw me off, as if Fitzgerald just left the book unfinished. I didn't even get it first that the last page I read was the last page of the book, I expected a "to be continued..." So I am really looking forward to a discussion of the book as soon as everyone has finished it, meanwhile Catcher in the Rye seems quite interesting, I like its colloquial style and a somewhat humorous tone, the author is great in his ability to delineate a very vivid and a realistic picture of this boy, I like the beginning: "I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything. I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened..." a nice start for the book, sort of sets you up in the right mood ... enjoy the show ... .
I was certainly happy to hear absolutely no strange Skyview news on Monday morning. After a big weekend like prom, I always wonder...will we be having an emergency faculty meeting? Thankfully the answer was no. I'm glad last week's presentations and class discussions made an impact on you. Let the message stick. I have been so pleased to see how well you've all supported each other through AP testing. You have worked hard and applied yourselves, and through that process, you've been united by a shared goal. Hang onto this; let your mutual respect for each other be the prevalent theme of your senior year. The worst part of high school is living with the horrid restrictions that come from cliques; if you can see past those imagined lines, you won't need to live your life with a countdown. I encourage you to come to school each day with the intent to build relationships so that by the time your ten or twenty year reunion rolls around, you'll genuinely want to go and can show up in a non-inebriated state. Thanks, everyone, for your honest evaluations of class. The consensus of the group was that it would have been helpful to have seen practice exams earlier in the year in order to have some context for our topics of study. I also realized--far too late--that I could have made our SOAPS/Tone analysis more relevant for you by asking you to write essays that incorporated it. I made the assumption that this was something you already knew, but Natalya's posting made it clear that this was something she (and probably most) had to discover. My guess is, though, that many people haven't made this connection. So...I know what I can do to improve. This brings up an interesting observation in response to Thomas' posting about teachers and students. Teachers think they're invaluable...students think they can independently learn everything they need...I believe that neither is true. Bad teachers limit good students...A teacher can only be as good as students allow her to be. The best classrooms exist where everyone realizes that mutual responsibility is necessary. So, as always, thanks for coming in with curiosity and a good work ethic. As for you, Thomas...IF you have time to read and think about Catcher in the Rye, here's what you need to know. Sydney Clos, Mina O'Brien, Matt Goosen, Mitch Amort, Chris Tamura and Tyson Cecka have signed up to read the book. I assume you have Tyson's e-mail. If so, find out what his group has decided upon for their reading schedule. Wednesday and Friday will be discussion days. On Friday, students will be turning in their book notes, which can be written in journals. (Obviousely, you can turn in your work late. We'll talk when you return to school.) The directions are on the syllabus. Do you still have it? If not, let me know and I'll get the directions to you. We're thinking of you with pride every day! The air circulation system has turned off and I'm starving. Time to go. See you all tomorrow! Mrs. V-A
I just wanted to tell Thomas how hot he was in his Oregonian picture. With that kind of outward sex appeal I'm amazed that he hasn't pursued a full-time science t-shirt modeling gig. I know that however hired him would have a customer in me for sure! Good luck Tom and Skyview in the ISEF comp! By the way, Catcher in the Rye isn't for everyone, if you don't like it from the start, you might want to switch because it doesn't change much. However, some people REALLY identify with the desperate feeling of not quite fitting in with the world. The book didn't grab me like Gatsby did, which I really enjoyed, but As I Lay Dying needs some love too, so far it's me and Kailie V and I'd like some people to share with, so think about it. Love Rob
Hi this is Thomas Chen posting from a HUGE GIGANTIC computer lab inside the Oregon Convention Center. Everything is going well so far,and it's an awesome place here, although I'm feeling the PRESSURE of this immense Intel ISEF competition more and more. I had a wonderful chance already to meet people from all around the country and the world, and I have collected emblems from most states of the US and over a dozen other countries via the student pin exchange program. I'm still assuming we are doing the book group. And Mrs.VA, I've decided to read "Catcher in the Rye". So I just need to know my book group and our agendas and plans for the week, such as what's the project all about; book notes; other works and preparations? Keep posting on the blog and keep me informed through the week. See ya all next week.
Just looking back at this year all I can say is that it flew by fast, way too fast to even realize that the junior year is gone... well almost gone. I think senior year will go by even faster, the more you have going on in your life the faster it seems to flow, every day is inundated with just ... life! I just have this analogy in my head: h.s. is like our salmon creek, college is like an Amazon, and after that it's an ocean, and hopefully you get into the warm current;) I am personally looking forward to the end of h.s., I just want to go out into "real" life and be sort of extricated from the feeling of being trapped in this tiny box, cause life just has so much more volume to it than we can actually see right now. I think college should be awesome, better classes, more people to meet, better professors, just feeling like you are your own person and you can do anything you want with your life. Actually when I was at Stanford our tour guide told us that students there can get as drunk as they want and have as many parties as they want as long as they don't bother anyone and don't get out of the dormitories, I think that's in a way a safer way to drink if you do drink than going out to the woods "camping." I missed the accident scene yesterday and the assembly today, but I also would like to think VA for talking to us about this issue today, it just makes it so much more personal and real when you talk about it, and I love it how our teacher actually cares about us. Really, thank you.
I just wanted to say that I think we had a really good discussion today third period. It was only some of us, but it was really really nice to talk about current issues within our country with other people my age, and Mrs. VA of course. I really enjoyed it.
I just wanted to commend Mrs. VA on a drunk-driving presentation that connected better with me than the pseudo-accident or marathon assembly. Personal relationships are what have the most influence on peoples' lives, no matter how much pop-culture goes into an assembly. So this weekend be safe, sober if possible, but if you do choose to drink, remember to have a plan, and that drunk-driving is NEVER the best alternative, or acceptable at all. Once again, great job AVA, have fun but be safe! Love, Rob OH, by the way, Thomas mentioned some independent reading? Could anyone fill me in on what that will entail? And while I'm having after-thoughts, good luck to everyone that's taking their AP History tests tomorrow. Happy Review!
I just wanted to say that i was quite impressed with the whole 15 minutes thing. The crowd was quiet and respectful in both the commons and the parking lot and there weren't too many jokes cracked later on that day. Either something of the message got through to the general mob or i have greatly underestimated their intelligence. ...well, probably the former of those two options. I also wanted to thank Mrs VA for the discussion we had in third period. First perioders truely missed out. hmmm, that was oddly written. Oh well. --beck
After two AP tests, I'm absolutely DYING to discuss some multiple choice questions... please! Somebody! Did you get D. on question 28 or A. on 17? All this anti-cheating just sounds like a challenge to me. So here's the plan for u.s., we all fabricate test booklets, replace them with the real booklets when our booklets get picked up, and mail the originals back to the College Board. Our goal is to have to take next year's tests in facilities with prison-like security. We'll call it operation Rebel Yell. Anyway, one day you'll look back at high school and just admire your naievity and such, and you'll be pleasantly nostalgic, at that point you'll buy yourself a Harley and hit the road for a couple months. As soon as H.S. ends I'll be anticipating my mid-life crisis (maybe crises), because maturity and responsibility are WAY overrated. ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS! Carpe Dium! Much love to all bloggers for making MY h.s. experience memorable Love, Rob
I don't know about all of you, but I'm REALLY REALLY GLAD High School is almost over................It's time for the real college lifelong challenges. Although I have to admit that I've learned and experienced sooooooo much in the last three years. And Here is a little vivid memory from my three days of AP tests in as many days: "Remember, the Multiple Choice questions may NEVER be discussed in any shape or form with ANYONE at ANYTIME, failure to do so may result in the invalidation of grades and possible legal actions for COPYRIGHTS VIOLATION!" Yeah you realize from the AP test experience how much your mind has been trained to memorize stuff........because i've literally memorized the whole AP instruction script by now. I'll see all you guys tomorrow, the only day I'll be in school for two weeks.
I totally agree...its amazing to think that once we finish up the last months of this year, we only have one year left. Then high school is done. It's going by SO fast!
As Fleckenstein would say, I pooched that test. Which is a first class bummer, but I'm just glad to be finished. I need to take more english in college anyway. Anyway, yeah, you guys know we're seniors next year. Maybe it's just me, but I still feel like we were freshlings just a short time ago, not 3 years....
I share the relief that I am sure everyone is feeling. I can't believe how fast this year went by and I am so glad that we were well prepared for the test. I can remember reading all of the documents from or about Indians but that was almost 6 months ago. WOW this year flew by. Thomas you're stress level must be through the roof and Rachel that must have been the most fun you've ever had. Hmmmm... Sarcasm. My mind is still spewing literary terms. Ah almost time to sleep. Oh yeah Mrs. V-A, You Rock . Bye Bye ~Frank
Wow, you two must be taking the AP French test also. Congratulations to you two for surviving two AP tests in ONE DAY! That double test experience must've eclipsed any academic strenuous activity you've ever accomplished in your life. I can't even imagine how I would survive because I just went home and slept. For me, the continued stress hormone pumper is still pumping strong doses into my brain, for I have four more AP tests to go, three MORE this week......Yeah I'm begging myself that hopefully I can survive like you guys too.. And have a happy stress relieving time in English class the next two weeks!
Yeah wow... I can't even describe this feeling right now... Chad can understand what I'm talking about. After enduring about 10 hours of testing today and now having it all over. It's undescribable. The English test itself wasnt too bad, I think I anticipated it to be much worse, considering the practices seemed to be much more difficult than the test itself. Also, what a relief that one of the essay prompts wasnt based on a passage. I hope everyone else felt that they did well... Congrats on surviving the AP experience.
Sigh..........Relief............And what not..........I can't believe three years' of English language and composition career just culminated in this huge grand assessment exam, and it's over in a flash of thought. Seems like I haven't done anything significant and it's already over......Yeah it's time to have a moment of silence........To honor all the three years of learnings we had that prepared us for this exam. Anyways, how did everyone else feel about the test? (Remember, NEVER discuss Multiple choice questions.......lol).
Thanks Thomas for providing that site. SOAPS is where its at. ~ Frank
I was reading the free response essays and scoring commentaries that Thomas posted a link to and I just had a revelation: there is a purpose to SOAPS! No really, most people that got 9s or 8s used the SOAPS method, they talked about the subject (themes and ideas), occasion for the writer to write addressing this subject(s), audience whom he/she addressed, what purpose the author had when writing this piece and style of the writing including tone and rhetorical strategies. Now after two years of thinking that soaps is a waste of time I finally come to a conclusion that it is really the best way to organize your thinking and to make sure that you include everything in your essay in order to score all the possible "points." I tend to just randomly name facts as I go, mentioning the style, occasion and everything in a mix, but I think putting info in a coherent and organized manner will show the scoring person that you actually know what you are talking about, you can express in a very erudite and orderly manner and you are not just brain- storming. So my another suggestion is practice soaps, just look at some of the essay prompts on the link Thomas gave us and as you read each one of them jot down just a couple of words for SOAPS that you think you might have used if you were writing the essays at the exam. Or better yet, relax and forget all about the test until 7:30 on Monday morning:)
Hey Frank, go here urlLink AP Central's English Language and Composition past essay prompts. , although you need a collegeboard Login (Which it's good and very helpful to have one). Here is an EXCELLENT article from "KidSource Online" urlLink that provides insights into students' attitudes in schools with survey statistics and some common misconceptions. All students and especially teachers should take the time to read this article . This statement below from that article is VERY true: Popular opinion has it that students' academic success depends on the quality of their teachers and textbooks. Ask the students themselves, however, and you get a different view. Here is how they account for their academic achievement: Most students believe their ability and effort are the main reasons for school achievement. By the same token, if asked whether they would prefer to be called smart or hard-working, they will choose smart almost every time. Why? Because they believe that hard-working students risk being considered either excessively ambitious or of limited ability, both of which they would find embarrassing.
Hey does anyone know a site that I could go to that provides writing prompts or multiple choice tests. ~ Frank
Hey Everyone, I'm having a blast here at UDUB.......I was wondering, since I missed the last three days of school, did anyone who's taking AP Lit next year get a specific "summer reading list" or summer work that we have to accomplish before september? ......Just curious, otherwise have an awesome summer! And as Rob mentioned, keep blogging THomas
hey all you out in bloggerland. thanks for makin this year the best ever. keep bloggin on through the summer— Fahrenheit 911 opens this friday, that could provide interesting discussion, but who cares about that now? everybody have a safe time in your celebrations, remember the drunk driving talk, and i'll see you all back in september, but hopefully sooner. Love Rob
Hey All MY AP ENGLISH BUDDIES! Today's my last day of school........I'm going up to UW for six weeks. I have to say that this year has been an awesome year in VA's AP English class. Despite a somewhat stressed out, apprehensive studying for AP Test period, we've had lots of fun in that class. We've grown both academically and socially. So enjoy the rest of year three days of school.......Make the most out of your junior year.....Great memories will be with us forever. And old friendship and fun times may never be replaced. Hopefully I'll see some of you again next year in AP English or AP COmparative GOvernment class! FINALLY, KEEP THE BLOG UP THIS SUMMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF YOU CAN, BLOG ANY AND ALL OF YOUR SUMMER FUNS! SHARE ALL YOUR STORIES WITH US!!!!!!! Best Wishes Thomas Chen
we're going to try the farewell miss clark party tomorrow. same plan, same time, i just hope she's here this time. any food or beverage you can bring would be appreciated
I have been injected with some sort of spirit now that the only things left to do in English are sign yearbooks and watch Ferris. Thanks Mrs. VA for an awesome year and such a simple yet appropriate pair of final prompts. As far as school spirit goes this last year was not only unprecedentend and uncharacteristic of Skyview, it was also PHENOMINAL. The key was a group of kids, mostly seniors but several juniors and sophomores as well that were willing to set aside their images (rip up their cool cards *wink*) and have fun with outfits, chants, and the good feeling they got when Skyview won. If we want to have that kind of a fall and winter sports season again it's going to take some leadership. Kids quickly forget how much fun it is to get G'd UP from the feet up and yell at Prairie high school, but all it takes is a key figure like Jake Valentine this year to really motivate kids. Cheerleaders keep up the good work, but help is needed to generate school-wide spirit. Everybody keep blogging this summer! I'm pretty sure we'll have a summer reading list so we can talk about that, but with each passing day, November draws closer. Love Rob
So this is a really exciting blog, so I've decided to spice it up a bit...or at least try. I don't know if anyone has noticed, but our school generally lacks school spirit. I admit, last year was AMAZING compared to every other year I have been at Skyview, but there is still room for improvement. During cheerleading practice we were discussing different ways to implement more school spirit throughout Skyview. However, it's going to take a lot more than just 15 girls out on the sideline. If anyone has any good ideas of how to get more of the student body involved, blog away! It will be greatly appreciated and we can have a super fun year next year being the old men (and women) on campus! Rachel Penny
thanks!
This was the prompt V-A gave us for the reflection part of the PDP: How have you grown as a reader, writer, and thinker over the course of your junior year? Reply in the form of a business letter Address it to Mrs. V-A Attach adn use evidence in the form of an enclosure Hope that's helpful! See you all tomorrow. Bethany
hey guys...for the self-evaluation that we have to do for our PDP, we have to write about how we've improved at reading, writing, and what was the third one? if anyone could tell me, i'd really appreciate it!
It's very true that we don't realize our milieus until we move away from them. When I moved up here from North Carolina, there was something different. I couldn't really describe what it was, but something in the personalities of people. There are pretty much the same restaraunts, stores and things to do around here as there are in most areas, so i could never figure out exactly what was different. Then I figured it out. It's the people. For the most part, people living in the Northwest are more "natural." Like Seattle is known for being artsy, and Portland is more of a naturalist area. Also, the first thing I noticed when I moved was the California pride. I never understood what was so special about California. Maybe it was just being in middle school when everyone is trying to find themselves by bragging about everything possible, but California always came up as a bragging right. It was amazing to me how many people were like, "well I'm from California!" My response was always was "your point is...?" To this day I have yet to figure out what is so special about California. Yes, it has great weather for the most part of the year, which is more than I can say for here, but I couldn't see myself just packing up my bags and moving down there. Even given the opportunity to, I declined to move to sunny So. Cal. Which brings up a whole nother aspect of milieu. Families. You would be surprised how completely different people live. Having my mom move down to California this past summer, I was completely excited to move in with the Gilfoys. Even though they seemed like a "normal" family. I realized there is no "normal" family. (Kind of like there are no "normal" people, like Thomas stated.) I always thought that I just lived in the most "interesting" family, but every family has something different about them. After moving in with them, I have realized many small things that I love about my own family and how differently I used to live. I guess it's kind of like leaving my family a couple years early. Next year when most of you go off to college you think you will never miss your family and you're dying to get out of your house. Getting out of the house will be great, but trust me though, you will miss them and all of the small things, especially your own mother's cooking. -Rachel Penny
Ok, this blog needs to be spiced up once again. So what did everyone think of the great and rather humorous documentary? First of all, in the film so often you'll see all the "weird" cultures, and the people in these communities/sect will be so proud of their culture and heritage and religious practices. To go off on Mrs.VA's commment that "we don't see our own milieu when we are living in it", I believe this statement to be mostly true. If a person has never moved to a different state/country, then that person will always see himself as a "normal" human being, because they are so immersed in their culture in which they were born. But when you move, that's when you will discover your milieu, and when you move to a drastically different place you also can more objectively see the milieu of your new home. That happened to me several times already, first the culture shock when I moved from China to California, and then I then I brought an interesting mix of Chinese/California culture when I moved up here to Vancouver Washington. Here is just a list of the many many milieus of Vancouver, if you don't realize already: 1:As Erin mentioned: "ALL THE SUBARUS AND SUVS!!!!!!"(this is a very interestiing discovery as I moved here, I guess even Georgia has much less SUVs) 2:Ski and Snowboarding Crazy(Go figure with all the outdoor opportunities here) 3:People drive soooooooo painfully slow and very carefully obeying the speed limit(Compare to California....You'd be kidding if you sped just 10mph above the speed limit....in California 50 mph 5 lane highway completely jammed with 80mphers) 4:People very much obey the law, the society as a whole is a lot more strict and calmer.(People very rarely question authority here, I can elaborate on that later). 5:The society's pace is soooooooooooo slow(downtown stores close before dark, what???? that's unbelievable in california) 6:I've never heard the word "Spendy" before I moved to Washington 7:Fast food dominates(somehow people are ok with fastfoods here) 8:All these wetlands and storm drainages(which of course the "rain milieu" of washington) And there are many many more.............Milieus and these subtle differences of cultures are what's so unique about every place, everyone of us......Catch a glimpse of New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Miami, Honolulu, Victoria(BC)......Wow what a range of different milieus. Too often have I heard people calling each other "you are not normal", or people urging me to "just being a normal person". But I will often ask back, "what do you mean by NORMAL?". "How do you define normal????" Because "a normal" human being is different in each culture/country, and you have to have a firm grasp of the milieus of that culture to be normal. Like people will always see me tapped on with Chinese culture, even if I realize it or not. And I will not try to act like everybody else just because I want to look like "a normal person", because THERE IS NO NORMAL PERSON, especially in America. The immigration and custom scene where people from all corners of the world feeling all patriotic and excited to become an American Citizen is simply a phenomenal picture patented for America. After all, America is a country founded on uniquenesses and differences and immigrants and we continue to pride ourselves for that. And thus in America, the world "normal" is moot and there is simply NO NEED FOR NORMAL! America has always to protrude out from the world as NOT BEING NORMAL!!!!!! In the land of the free, uniqueness is happiness; And differences drive our country forward;
Nostalgia as a whole is vastly underrated. Advertisors recognize its potential, filling ads with subliminally old soundtracks that put you in a good mood for being 19 once. Nostalgia is all around. People take pictures so they can look back 20 years from now and remember how good they looked in that sweater, or what they barbequed that fourth of July. I myself enjoyed my own dose of nostalgia going to a concert by the Presidents of the United States of America. They were super popular in elementary schoo with hits like Lump, Kitty, and Peaches, but took an 8 hear hiatus (sp?) at the height of their popularity. They've reunited and played at the Rose Festival for the glorious price of FIVE DOLLARS. I had a great time, and so did several non-blogging peers. They played all their hits, some new ones (yay!) and even covered some Beatles, Sex Pistols, and Video Killed the Radio Star. Rick White said it best. I always loved PUSA, but I never dreamed I'd finally see them my senior year of High School. Somehow I think it will be a memory he sure as hell won't forget. Love, Rob
I too fondly remember a time when I could fit both legs into a single pantleg of my size 30 waist JNCOs in the 4th grade. I also remember the furious discussions with my father after covering them in grass stains playing football at recess. It is an era I will forever remember with a twinge of longing in my heart. I believe the same will be true once I exit high school. In the elementary years all my friends and I could think about was reaching middle school, and now I wish I had savored those moments. Understanding this time conundrum, I refuse to make the same mistakes twice. Not even in the most boring, drawn out day of high school will I ever say “Man, I wish I was in college,” because I know I’ll blink my eyes and be a forty year old man sitting in a recliner in my underwear with a beer on the table and a hand in my drawls as an homage to Al Bundy. For a seventeen-year-old that is a terrifying thought and one I’m not ready to accept, but that day is point B, and fortunately I’m still at point A. But unlike my 11-year-old self, this time I’m going to enjoy the journey. Today I still wear size 30 waist pants, only they fit a little differently. -Ryan PS – Pat and Ryan – stunning resemblance, but I think it’s Alf, (Alien Life Form)
Pat I have to thank you for that shout out. But i do have to condone you because Alf is spelled with fa "f" and not a "ph", if youre going to post about Alf get it right. I have had some friends in the past month bring up this fact that i do resemble Alf the tv icon. i think its great and will make sure that this never dies. Another thing i want to add is i loved your little peace on JNCO. i was one of the unfortunate kids and never did have a pair because my parents thought they were hideous, but i envied everyone that had a pair. --Alf
First of all, praise to all of you who went to see harry potter, my respect for you is boundless. It's interesting to hear the feedback from the movies, so no one else was disappointed that it didn't show Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup....I was im not going to lie about it. Yeah Yeah, the movie couldn't be that long....but why not? Anyone who goes to see the movie most likely has some interest in the book so they will not mind staying in the theatre an extra half hour to see some vital parts of the book. I am not saying I didn't enjoy the movie-it was quality, I am just saying I stayed up till 3:30 to see a movie and it didn't even have quite possibly one of the most important parts of the book in it. So ya, enough about that. Now that thats over with, I would like to give a shout out to Ryan Vasbinder for his stunningly real portrayal of Alph, the TV icon, in the late 80's and early 90's.
What's every person here thinking about Clark's party? It'd be cool, and I'll certainly enjoy sending her off. I liked having her as a teacher. I'll miss VA more though (if you're reading Mrs. VA, someone's paying me to say this). It's been great having her two years straight and seeing my writing grow, as well as having her watch the progression and help me through it. I know that there's some of you who've had her for three years and are ready for a new teacher, and I see your point. I find it interesting the difference between last year and this year. It's a difference which struck me when I was looking for stuff to write my PDP's on. I'm glad how she conducted the class this year; it was very worth while. Poor Alex is right here next to me. It's Clark's 2nd period, and she still can't access either one. I'm guessing that all of you are very ready to just leave. The will to work is leaving, and I really just don't want to do to much. I'm ready to hop that plane to Germany, head off to my summer concerts, not as ready to do side work (but will somehow), and just slide into next year. It won't be so easy, especially all this college stuff, but I'm ready to start anew with senior year. I really just want to throw away all the college stuff that isn't Washington; I'm not really interested in leaving the state, and I'm even less interested now. It's not smart to trash the stuff yet, but sometimes I don't want to be smart. Anywho, I'm going to check scholarships or the US blog. Till next time - Adios and God bless. Tristan
For someone who has never read Harry Potter, never seen Harry Potter, not because I don't like them, I've just never been interested, the latest movie was very entertaining. I've finally picked up the sorcerer's stone, which I think is the first book(someone tell me) that has been sitting on my shelf for an eternity and decided to read it so I think that's telling about the movie. I enjoyed it, definately a visual feast and fun. Even not knowing the background the story was simple enough to understand. Is that kid who had the blonde hair and was a little biatch in the first 2 movies?
I have also seen the new Harry Potter. Although some people are disappointed in the movie, I thought it was actually good. There is no way they would be capable of putting the entire book into a movie. However, if I hadn't read the books, some parts would have been a little bit confusing. The only disappointment I had with the movie was that they never really explained the map in full detail. If you are they type of person who only goes to see the movies, or if you just haven't been caught up in the HP frenzy, then I highly suggest you read the books. The movies are good but they would never be able to give the books the justice they deserve. The first book takes a while to get into, but it is definitly worth the energy. Rachel Penny
I spent the entire weekend basically watching Godfather, and thus coming to a conclusion that I am in love with Al Pacino and that therefore I shall go to a cloister unless I meet a prince on a white horse who will be an identical twin of Al, but preferably a couple of years younger (about 40...). Al Pacino is the greatest actor in the history of man and is a true inspiration. After watching the first two movies I was going to resign as the KGB princess sure that my destiny is to become a mafia godmother, but with all my regret I have to admit that the third movie sort of disillusioned me with the tragic life of mafiosi families, so thus I decided to stay in KGB for a while and then maybe go to a monastery once I am too old to search for my prince Al Pacino's YoungerTwin:( Anyway I encourage all of you who have not seen the movie to see it, believe me that you shall not regret the nine hours of your life spent to see the greatest classic of all time. I saw HP3 this weekend also and I have to admit that I was very impressed with the new director and that I actually really liked the movie unlike that first two:) I agree with Rob that the movie's main improvement was that it was fast, entertaining and much more like the book. I couldn't believe that it was over so fast though, I want more now:) I think we should open a club in our school, called something like "HP Nerds, Unite!":)
Bethany, your parody brought me back to the days when I used to live near Seattle with your description of Puget Sound. After reading your parody, I was reminded of a part in Huckleberry Finn, I don't know if you remember but Mrs. V-A called it the "mini-vacation" or something like that. It was the scene in Huckleberry Finn where Twain is describing the sun rising over the river. Your clear and thorough description of the events taking place and the surroundings is what brought me to recollect this scene in Huckleberry Finn. Also, I applaud you on writing a parody-that can be a lot more challenging than cranking out a compare/comtrast paper. So, in essence, as a Compton native would say "mad props to you, it was off the hizzle fo shizzle"
Hey, great action on the blog and I'm sorry I don't have time to post on that right now, but it's 330 in the morning. I'm up because I saw the greatest wizard/witch-based movie of all time— Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban. It was my favorite book, but I loved one and two as well and I didn't think the movies had entirely done them justice. The new one is just that; new. The new director, Alfonso Cuaron (something like that, he directed Y tu Mama Tambien) did an absolutely fabulous job making some changes that made the first movies lose a little magic (pun intended) compared to the books. For instance, robes are worn only once that I can recall, being replaced by jeans and sweaters, making the characters more comparable to the muggle adolescents in the audience. Also, Draco Malfoy, though still hateable, is now a coward in the face of confrontation. He takes on the role of a character like Wylie Coyote in the fact that he had malicious intentions, yet always ended with a frying pan bent around his face. Lastly, Pat said that it didn't always follow close to the book. Don't get it twisted— none of the story was altered, however, in the interest of time, much quidditch is subtracted in place of plot advancement, which is entirely ok, because the foreshadowing is MUCH better orchestrated than in previous movies, making it much MORE like the book in that sense. If you can't tell, I LOVED IT. It was funny, fast, and satisfyingly sentimental. I'll see it again w/ anyone that wants to go. A word to the wise, I might be a little grumpy with the mere 3 hours of sleep I plan on getting, so if you must talk to me, PLEASE let the topic be Harry Potter. Kahli Veys was there too, so if she's at school, she too can fill you in on the glory that is HP. May all your sleeping patterns be much more consistant than mine, Love Rob
Umm ya, its about 3:06 in the morning and i just got home from seeing harry potter. I am seriously tired, but I thought it would be important to blog to share the improvement of the third movie in comparison to the previous two. Go see it, its better. It doesn't follow the book as strict as some would like, but it makes for a quality flick.
Hideeho Bloggeroonies I same to be borrowing a page from Ned Flanders on that one. What's going one you probably all asleep people? I know that lots o' people are off at that Harry Potter opening, my little sister included. Bethany, I'd like to read that parody gig sometime, it'd be cool to see. It can take time to write a nice parody, or a nice thing in general. I'm still trying to finish up my Stalin/Spongebob parody (it's almost done, and thank God I finally have an idea for the ending!). It's fun to write these things, and we all have our different styles, and practice makes perfect, so don't worry. Also, true dat about leaning on God. Coming to him makes us realize how stupid materialism, selfishness, etc. can really be, if we take time to be sincere and thoughtful with him. Speaking of said parody, it's at the center of what I want to do for my senior project. I'd like to direct and produce it next year, try and make it part of a student-written winter one-acts show that we've had in the wings throughout this school year. I know Megan might be interested in writing a piece. My thesis'll center around different styles and methods of directing, but the project is what I'm really interested in. VA really liked that I'm going to do it, and she's been encouraging in telling me to do a project that is important to me. I've worked almost all school year on my play (named Stalinpants = Stalin + Spongebob Squarepants), so it'll be a great way to tie that in to something like senior project. Hope some of you guys might be interesting in trying out next year. We'd love to have you in any of the shows, and Stalinpants specifically has a large cast, so you'd have a nice chance of getting a part. Anywho, I find it interesting that we've got senior boards next year. I can totally understand though why some juniors last year were quick to decorate themselves and their cars in Senior '04 stuff. It'll be a fun year (pre-nostalgic sigh). Anywho, I'm going get going, and maybe go to bed sometime soon; most likely. Till next time. Adios and God bless. Tristan the Yeehawman.
"Anthem" Ayn Rand "I am. I think. I will. My hands.... My spirit.... My sky.... My forest... This earth of mine. It is my eyes which see, and the sight of my eyes grants beauty to the earth. It is my ears which hear, and the hearing of my ears gives its song to the world. It is my mind which thinks, and the judgment of my mind is the only searchlight that can find the truth. It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the only edict I must respect. Whatever road I take, the guiding star is whithing me, the guiding star and the loadstone which point the way. They point in but one direction. They point to me. I know not if this earth on which I stand is the core of the universe or if it is but a speck of dust lost in eternity. I know not and I care not. For I know what happiness is possible to me on earth. And my happiness needs no nigher aim to vindicate it. My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its on goal. It is its own purpose. And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will grant them joy and peacs and pride. This god, this one word: "I"
(Ego translates as "I" from Greek) I have never asked myself that question before, the answer always seemed to be: duh... evil! Of course until... I read the Fountainhead, which I finally finished today and have successfully proclaimed to be my Bible:) Although it is as radical in its ideas as any philosophical book could possibly get, the philosophy is integrated in a great, crazy story of an architect: the greatest egotist alive, a man of highest level of integrity. And here is what he says at his trial before the collectivist/altruist world accusing him of being an egotist: "The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man's first duty is to himself. His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of others. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes. "From the beginning of history ,the two antagonists have stood face to face: the creator and the second-hander. The creator lives for his work. He needs no other men. His primary goal is within himself. The parasite lives second-hand. He needs others. Others become his prime motive. "The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion. It demands total independence in function and in motive. To a creator, all relations with men are secondary. Second-hander declares that man exists in order to serve others. He preaches altruism. Altruism is the doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self. No man can live for another. "Men have been taught dependence as a virtue. The man who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is a parasite in motive and makes parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces nothing but mutual corruption. "Men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve, but to give. Men have been taught that it is virtue to agree with others. But the creator is the man who disagrees. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim with the current. But the creator is the man who goes against the current. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to stand together. But the creator is the man who stands alone. Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness the ideal of virtue. But the creator is the egotists in the absolute sense, and the selfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge, or act. These are functions of the self. "The egotist in the absolute sense is not the man who sacrifices others. He is the man who stands above the need of using others in any manner. He does not function through them. He is not concerned with them in any primary matter. Not in his aim, not in his motive, not in his thinking, not in his desires, not in the source of his energy. He does not exist for any other man - and he asks no other man to exist for him. This is the only form of brotherhood and mutual respect possible between men. "You can fake virtue for an audience. You can't fake it in you own eyes. Your ego is the strictest judge. It's easier to donate a few thousand to charity and think oneself noble than to base self-respect on personal standards of personal achievement." "People are not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the second-hander's delusion - prestige. They don't say "This is what I wanted because I wanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me." The only cardinal evil on earth is that of placing your prime concern within other men. If one doesn't respect oneself one can have neither love nor respect for others. "The only thing that matters, my goal, my reward, my beginning, my end is the work itself. My work done my way. A private, personal, selfish, egotistical motivation." "I never think of myself in relation to anyone. I just refuse to measure myself as part of anything." "I came here to say that I do not recognize anyone's right to one minute of my life. Nor to any part of my energy. Nor to any achievement of mine. I am a man who does not exist for others. The integrity of a man's creative work is of greater importance than any charitable endeavor. I recognize no obligations toward men except one: to respect their freedom and to take no part in a slave society." "Is sacrifice a virtue? Can a man sacrifice his integrity? His honor? His freedom? His ideal? His convictions? The honesty of his feelings? The independence of his thought? But these are a man's supreme possessions. Anything he gives up for them is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain. Self-sacrificed? But it is precisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed."
Hey guys! So, I know that I'm a little behind the times with the blog, but I just wanted go back to Pat's thing on the essays and sharing them with each other. I think it's a really good idea, especially for people in the other classes to share essays about the same books. Anyways...Pat, I thought that your essay was really good. It reminded me of how materialistic America has become, and we all get swept up in it. As much as you think you don't, I'm sure that all of you have. I mean, we all go to Skyview, and none of us seem to be doing that poorly. I mean, my parents both of decent jobs, we live in a pretty nice house, and we have enough food and clothes and things. I just throw myself a pity part sometimes, when I go over to a friend's house who lives in Ashley Heights or has a closet full of nice clothes, or wears a different outfit every day...it makes it really hard to be content with what you have and to not be dissatisfied. But (I'm gonna be religious here), as long as you lean on God, you should never be dissatisfied with what you have. And that's something that I struggle with, but that your essay reminded me of. So, thanks Pat. I wrote a parody, and it's not too bad. It follows these few pages in "Their Eyes Were Watching God," and it's a really amazing part of the book that I wanted to try to recreate. It was hard, so I'm not sure how good my parody is. Read it, see what you think of it! But I've gotta go. All of the Junior Project stuff is do tomorrow...I should start. Bye! Bethany Mary looked up at her with hungry eyes, only wanting to listen to the unfolding story of her Mom’s life. Sarah looked around as her eyes slowly took in the summer surroundings. Bees swimming drunkenly from flower to flower, the sun slowly dipping into the Puget Sound, and the gentle crash of waves on the shore. She smiled and gazed down at her patient daughter. Mary’s unanticipated interest in Sarah’s teenage years inspired her to tell her story. She thought of where to begin, and her eyes glanced heavenwards. The afternoon sunlight danced through the branches of the weeping willow tree and made playful shadows oh Mary’s excited face. Sarah sighed with content, and decided to begin at the time when she first imagined that maybe she wasn’t a little girl anymore- that maybe she was growing into something greater. She decided to tell Mary about the time she swam in the ocean at midnight. It was a warm, summer evening on Whidbey Island. Sarah had spent the evening roasting s’mores over a beach fire and singing songs with her family. Every evening of that weeklong vacation, she had been on the beach. She spent every moment walking along the shore, but at night liked to listen to the waves crash on the rocks, slowly churning beach glass and barnacles into sand. The ocean called to her, like a mystery that needed to be unearthed. Not in the way that the ocean calls to a sailor, but she was mesmerized by the intense drifting current and the white foam that disappeared after only moments on the rocky shore. It inspired her. How? Why? It was like a beat lost long ago, in another time, drifting across the ocean to meet her. What? How? Why? The song of the ocean was not a real song, yet the salt sea air made her drunk to the world. It followed her through her every move, and it pleasantly haunted her dreams and thoughts. The ocean sang to her, the waves the symphony and the air its conductor. It seemed to connect her to a place or time almost unreal; her observations became acute and alive. Things that she had not noticed suddenly became vivid and momentous. They were unearthed and filled her mind and conscience. She took a few steps towards the water, admiring the sparkling rocks and glistening water. Although her father’s guitar was now safely inside the cabin, the song still swayed in her mind, a friend in the warm night. Suddenly the guitar, waves, and air were all playing together in harmony; a melody so strong and inspiring yet so soft and beckoning that she could hardly contain herself. She fell against the soft sand and stared at the stars, twinkling happily in the dark sky. Why had she never noticed them before? The song of the ocean controlled her; she closed her eyes and seemed to float closer and closer towards heaven and the stars. Did the waves always make music? Did the moon always make the water sparkle like diamonds? Yes, but not for her. Tonight was her night. She felt limp and drunk with flying towards heaven and listening to earth’s song. After awhile she stood up and looked across the Sound. She was seeking some sort of confirmation of her vision, her dream, her revelation. She received her answer. The water nodded its agreement, the waves roared its truth, and the stars shone in affirmation. The waves rushed over her bare feet, a usually chilling sensation that now left her smiling with indescribable warmth. She waded into the water. About to dive in, she glanced back at the cabin where here parents and siblings were sleeping. She turned around and dove into the cold water. She was seventeen! She was a dancing star and a singing wave, turning over and over in the ocean. Was the sky so joyful for her? Nothing answered. She searched the heavens, floating across the waves in the water. Looking, waiting, breathing short with impatience. She stood and looked around her; the world was made in a new light.
The school food actually sounds like a good idea. Or how about how it's not healthy to have to eat within 30 minutes? If you go out to lunch by the time you get there you only have 10 minutes to eat before you have to leave. It took me forever to decide what topic I wanted to do. However, once I picked it seemed like good topics came up everywhere, it's crazy how that always seems to happen. I finally chose to do the benefits of extracurricular activities. It's actually interesting how being involved in an after-school club or sport is related to higher test scores and better attendence. It'd be interesting to see what everyone else came up with for their junior project. Have a fun time with all the nice weather while it lasts! - Rachel Penny
So, this is my first time blogging for English class, whoohoo! This is very exciting. I don't quite know what to say, there really isn't a whole lot of controversial stuff to talk about here like there is in Clark's class. What is everyone doing their Junior Project on? I'm doing how disgusting and unhealthy school food is, because honestly...yuck! The deep fried fries and extremely greasy pizza everyday, that needs to stop eventually. Paul, I totally agree with you about how it's hard to keep your mind engaged on school when you do nothing in other classes...ah! I don't know what to do with myself, I have absolutely no motivation to do anything. What a great attitude, right? Haha. Anyway, I'll see all you kids at school tomorrow!
Rob I commend you on your idea. Most students won't be able to vote on their own, I for one(missed the cut off by 2 weeks). Paul, your recomendation on Ma$e's new song is superb, I heard it last Saturday and recognized the unique lyrics and smooth, calm vocals, so I had a feeling it was Ma$e. Do you know if that was a single, or if it is part of a CD?
Gosh, I remember JNCO's. 4th grade, had to get me a pair, couldn't afford it, I was a very sad little boy. I remember them having innovative tee-shirts too. Amazing how everything changes, since I don't think any of us would go near JNCO's now. Are they even still around? I think your skyview votes for the vote idea is very innovative, it's the kind of idealistic idea I'd expect to read about in Newsweek or something... Oh the possibilities. Is anybody else having trouble focusing their energy. We have work in this class, clarks(somewhat), and my math class. But everything else, especially my 3rd and 4th periods, are nothing. It's really hard to keep a work minded mind not having to do any work. I love summer, but I hate the mindless feeling I get from it. I always like to have my energy focused on something. I think I'm going to end up being one of those guys who can't bring themselves to retire, and when they have to they hate it and go back to work after 8 months. Closing note, Ma$e- bling bling- is back. Everyone needs to go listen to 'Welcome Back', who else can you see sampling the welcome back kotter song? It's actually very good, and he hasn't given up on his preaching, which is cool. But it's definately a break from the all the mindless club music I hear all the time now.
i think that would be a good idea. there is no way to have a student government that completely represents the school, but your idea is definitely an improvement. seeing as this is my first year at skyview, sometimes it seems like asb doesn't really do anything aside from blatantly violating the dress code and getting away with it. perhaps that's just me being cynical about the way things work. haha. go for it buddy, anything is worth a try.
Rob, what you will be doing is unprecedented, unique, and first of its kind.(For that matter you can patent this ingenius idea.......JK.....or at the least claiming your originality of that idea as your intellectual property). But seriously, if I interpreted your message correctly, I think core concept is to get more young people our age involved in politics, the political process, and especially how the political process works in a democratic society - with the funamentals manifested in the act of voting. We all realize the age group of 18-21 represent the lowest percentage of elligible voters that actually vote in an election. For some odd reasons young people our age just does not care about policies of our nation(Heh when there is a draft I bet a lot more people will vote then, but then again it's too late by then). Youngesters, take your legitmiate part of control over the government!!!!!!!! We do not want the same old/senile/retired generals and shrewd politicians dictate our lives and draft us to be killed in some unknown regions of the world without our consent!!!!!!!!!! I support the statement that those who do not vote does not deserve complaints. THUS............GO VOTE, AT ANY OPPORUNITY YOU CAN.......AND THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION A TASTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS!!!!!!! TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR YOUNG LIVES AND PROSPEROUS FUTURE THROUGH THE ACT OF VOTING! And finally, people on the AP Fest party committee, please blog in and speakout about your plans and what activities are we going to have.......or is it a secret surprise party?
Maybe it's because it's one in the morning, but I had a thought that intrigued me a lot. I was thinking a little bit about how representative the ASB is of the students— and it's basically trust on behalf of the student body that gives the governing body "artistic license" to run the school as it sees fit. There are no referendums, and although meetings are open to the entire student body to sit in on, nobody ever does, or probably even knows it's an option. In an effort to make my presidency more directly representative as well as continue my theme of the importance of democratic participation, I would like to have the school vote on how I should vote in the elections held this November. It would be one vote representing the entire school, and it would sacrifice my own voice, but I think mock campaigning in school for candidates at all government levels would expand the knowledge and interest in politcs of the school: a heritage that would be far more valuable than the vote I would cast on my own. With a fervor that hinges on administrative support, I would like to pursue this concept. What does everyone think? I want comments from both students and their parents on this one. But not Mike Rush, he is an ignorant Pig-Dog who deserves no respect from anyone. (Mike demanded I begin trash talking on the blog). Secondly, I want to organize a large-scale trivial pursuit contest- who would be down to participate? Trivial Pursuit will be the next big thing in this school and nobody wants to miss out on this. May democracy live long and prosper. Love Rob P.S. Create Blogger profiles, they are kinda fun to do and give ME something to look at when I'm insomniacing
Whatever happened to the greatest corduroy company of all time? JNCO. The name radiates a sense of "gangster." In the grunge era of the mid 1990's, bands such as the Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana influenced me, as a elementary schooler, to pursue such the novel brand of JNCO. Now if you are pronouncing it JUH-N-COH, start pronouncing it JEEN-COH. During this time of my life, others strayed to other brands such as Lee Pipes-a jean that went straight down and was usually ridiculously baggy. Another blogger, Rob Muilenburg recalls JNCO's by stating "they changed my elementary life in a time when I hated Phil Sobolowski" Yes, Rob, I agree with you, they did also change my life. The JNCO scriblle will always live on as long as there is the memory.
Hello! I arrived at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth on Sunday night and am enjoying a new climate, new colleagues and new sights. Since Thomas asked about summer reading, I thought I would answer. Mr. Wargo and Mrs. Grey-Hatton will be teaching the senior AP classes next year. They have not assigned you any summer reading. However, take advantage of your freedom and free time this summer and read on your own. Your primary focus next year will be British literature and poetry. Perhaps this summer you can indulge yourself in more modern fiction. You might want to focus on prize-winning book lists like Pulitzer Prize winning novels or Booker Prize winners. Or focus on modern writers from around the world. Another option to consider is set yourself up with a book list of classics, because I guarantee you that you'll be in lit classes in college and wish you'd taken better advantage of your free time as people allude to books and authors you've heard of (maybe) but don't really know. A few books I'd recommend? Reading Lolita in Tehran The God of Small Things Persopolis Love in the Time of Cholera Anything by Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Ibsen, Woolf, Hardy, Neruda Red Azalea Germinal Have fun reading, be safe, and have a happy summer! Mrs. V-A
Languages are really an amazing thing. They can differ so much, or so little, and they open up so much about the world and culture that speaks them. Languages are so much deeper than many people give them credit for, but they are an essential part of the human experience. If we didn't have language, we wouldn't be human.
There are two days left until my school closes for the summer. I have two more days of pointless classes, as we've finished the year up already. A party in Deutsch I and I have to listen to speeches on controversial topics in World Studies, and I suppose I have to write a speech tonight so that I can give it tomorrow. I should get doing the research now, because it'll take awhile, but I have other, more pressing matters, like writing in my blog, vacuuming my room, changing my cat's litter, all that good stuff. And finding my remote. I was watching one of the newschannels, and the news guy was interviewing this woman on the recent phenomenon in America of organization, with shows like Clean Sweep, and stuff, and she was talking about how people spend a certain amount of time everyday looking for something when they could be doing something that they really want to do, and while she was saying that, I was desperately looking for my remote. It was ironic. I still need to find that remote.
Now that it's the middle of July, and my best friend is in California for the entire month, and my computer doesn't have internet, I feel really strange. It's like lonely, but not necessarily bored. Last week I rented Prince of Persia: Sands of Time for my Gamecube, and even kept the game past its due date to finish it, it was that good. So I'm not necessarily bored. Like tonight, for instance, I finished 'Lucky', by Eddie de Oliveira (he's cute). It was a really good book, and I'm glad I read it. However, now that the game is played, and the book is read, I seriously need something more to do. I hoped to have a job by now, but then, I had also hoped to be going on student exchange this autumn, but it's amazing how, no matter how hard you try, some plans just refuse to come to fruition. It's neurotic.

Welcome to our SwampLog. This is the Weblog we are starting as a place to store our thoughts, feelings, photos, opinions, and just about anything else about our family. The Garcia-Goldberg family. In October 2003, my partner, Will, and I were blessed with the birth of a little boy that we adopted - his name is Shai Garrett Garcia-Goldberg, our son. His birthmother Bekci, lived with us for the last month of her pregnancy and together we formed a unique bond via the process of Open Adoption. Our little boy, has brought much wonder and blessedness into our lives. We describe the feeling that being a family brings as a deep, rich, lush swamp - hence the name of our "blog": SwampLog.

Shai -you had a real bad day today with your teething.I hope it gets better for you. It hurts me to see you in that much pain. I love you Papi
Some days, Shai, you can be a really cranky baby. I guess that’s all part of being a baby, but sometimes it can really work your Papi’s nerves. Papi (you know the big guy they call Willie) knows you don’t really mean to get so cranky, but after all he takes care of you day in and day out, and doesn’t always get a lot of help from your Daddy (me) because I’m usually at work all day. So do me a favor and take it easy on him…he really wants to be the best dad a baby can have, but you don’t have to test him so hard.
My beloved Shai- today was a true test of my patience and a true test of your fussing. My love for you is forever, and today was a true test of that.

So now that I have this intraweb diary, I have almost no idea what to write on it. I don't even know if I want to care about proper spelling (no one else really seems to mind much) or punctuation (not many of you would even notice improper p, I'm convinced); I must though, as all but the occasional lapse will sour my soul. I've hemmed and hawed about entry number 2 for days. As I had no purpose in creating this web diary except to reply to Palinode, it lacked purpose; I lacked purpose. But no more. I am going to babble at you (don't worry, I will delete the worst of it before you even see it) until purpose develops; I purpose to find purpose. I now hate the word "purpose". Immensely. I would delete all uses and mentions of it above, except that I wish to preserve the reason why I hate it so. Lately my remembrances of my dreams have been extraordinarily brief. Not just brief by my usual standards (I have had my share of epic dreams, one of which I am still working on turning into a novel), but damn near Hegelian sense-certainty brief. Last night I dreamt that I was running. I have no idea where I was, what the light was like, what I was wearing, whether fast or slow, hot or cold, fatigued or exhilarated. Just running. Yesterday if you asked me in the morning what I dreamt, I would have told you that I was holding something orange. No idea what or where, etc. It is very hard to realize that you are lucid dreaming when your recollection amounts to doodly-squat.
Somehow, I accidentally made this blog, so I figured I'd post. This could be the start of something beautiful. tear.
Well, I had written a very nice, poking-fun-at-myself entry about how I haven't read Ulysses yet, and all the mock shame I felt about it. I told you that I have been trying to read it for about fifteen years, but that I keep putting it down to read other things. I told you all about books I read in the summer of 95, although there was a star which led you to the bottom of the page, where you would have read that although I had read those books, I hadn't in '95, as I can't find my Have Read list from that summer. Ooh, I even remember typing something like "it (the list) was supposed to be over there, see, where clearly there is now only that stupid pink bear, the star-shape-icecube tray. And Ulysses." I talked abit about the Quest, but not much (again from the memory hole: "the short version is that we were four good friends who fucked off a year or so of school to have a lot of creative fun, and every year since we get together to drink a lot of coffee."), only to mention that I did not keep my Quest goal for QE 10 to read the Big Books I hadn't read yet that I owned, which included Ulysses. I never read any of them. One of them was Infinite Jest, and I mentioned that after reading a urlLink Mimi Smartypants entry about her love of the book, I picked it up, and um, moved it to a new pile. There was also a few lines about how I wanted to have read Ulysses for today, bloomsday, about how I was ready to not get a lot of stuff, but the book hasn't even been moved. By now it should be plain to you: I lost an entry. I was just about done, ready to preview it, and I wanted to find one last link on "summer of 95" using urlLink Bananaslug . My browser crashed, and me with no back-up. I thought that there would be warning signs, as there usually is. Not this time. grrr. This entry is vastly unfresh compared to the original, as it had fun fresh links to reviews of books, and to a few other sites, which this entry clearly does not possess. It also had some stuff about me feeling like a fake intellectual, that soon I will get kicked out of the club ("bounce! bounce!! bounce!!!"). Oh! and there was this whole riff on the fake University course I had to take on faking knowledge of texts and authors, but it was really overworked, and I'm glad it's gone. I will, however, finish in the same spirit as before. I am off for a pint of Guinness, and will be carting the Big U with me for one more kick at the cat.
I know I promised that I would write about "Idiot Proof" when I was finished it, and that was a long time ago. Well, the truth of the matter is that I didn't finish it, as it is very annoying. So annoying that I hurled it across the room (with only ten pages left), dinging the corner of it on the hardwood. It still reposes near the box of homemade wine near the unfinished bookshelf Che gave me. I have only hurled one other book previous to this: Grendel by John Gardner. With three pages left, the book took such an infuriating turn I couldn't stand (well, sit) to hold it anymore. Whing! Scare the crap out of Max (the psychotic cat) did I, yes I did. I finished it, eventually, and I will finish Idiot Proof as well. Then you too can marvel at how many stupid things this man says. Hmm, and since Nick Hornby praises it in some issue of urlLink Believer I have kicking around, maybe I'll kick him around a little, too. I did finish my mixed tape for work. Following is the list of bands in the order they appear: Neutral Milk Hotel; Cat Power; Jesus and Mary Chain; Yeah Yeah Yeahs; Malcolm Mclaren; Sleater-Kinney; Modest Mouse; the Pretty Things; the Vines; Tori Amos; the Beatles; Telepopmusik; the Smiths; Pixies; Sonic Youth; Spiritualized; Dream Warriors; MC 900 ft Jesus; Tom Waits; U2. Maybe later I'll be all linky with these bands, but right now sleep beckons.
My name is Starcat, I work in a bookstore, and I'm a libraholic. In the last four years I have acquired, on average, one book every two days. Being a normal human, there is no way I can read this many books, and I fall behind by a book or two every week. This week is certainly no exception, unless you count falling more than two books back an exception (which technically it is). The new acquisitions are: Bill Bryson: the mother tongue (for the purposes of a staff pick*); John Gribbin: the birth of time (yes, these last two books do not have capitalized titles on the cover), a Big Bang book about time, which I am sure will give me many a chuckle as the BB is a pile of ad hoc hooey, but more on that in some other entry; Bulent Atalay: Math and the Mona Lisa (a book capitalizing on the baffling success of the Da Vinci Code; well, the publisher is trying to capitalize on it, the author probably just wanted to write a book on the genius of Leonardo, and now finds this to be rather easy - in fact, the book is most likely rather poorly proofed, being rushed to publication); urlLink Josey Vogels (java alert): Bedside Manners (this one I read); Noam Chomsky: Middle East Illusions (this came free, and it will probably read like I've already read it - American foreign policy is a mixture of the incompetent and rapacious with rare moments of deeply self interested altruism, and the Media rarely reports anything of value as they feel the public is either not interested or wouldn't understand, or else they have a corporate interest in distorting the news for profit, blah blah blah); Dorothy Parker in her own words (when my wit and my drinking collide I can do a mean Dot Parker impersonation: rare, but worth it, at least for me); Robin Robertson: Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker (this title was all in caps, but I have no need to shout the title at you; yes, I am a vegetarian, and I don't have a slow cooker, but the book is free, and who knows about the future). * Once a year the staff gets to pick two books to be put on a staff pick table/display for a month or so. I want one book of fiction, one non-fiction. The only stipulations are that the book can not be a hardcover, and must be somewhat non-expensive. Suggestions are welcome, as this sort of thing overwhelms me with options.
When I was conceived I was not alone. I had a twin, a sister, and the two of us developed, slowly, together. Until Fate intervened, and then my sister was no more. Her nascent body, abandoned by the imperatives of life, was consumed by mine for nourishment; this was of minor interest to me. Of major interest is that her soul was subsumed by mine; she lives within me still. As she exists only internally, and not externally, she matures at only half the rate of the rest of us. Inside me lives the soul of a 16 year old girl. Like, oh my god! that explains so much! lol! (ahem.) She is a pale girl as she doesn't get much sun. She has reddish brown hair, and likes to dress in browns and reds. I have met her a few times in my dreams. At times we are very close, and others she is quite cold, distant, and tests me. I should be very wary of her, but I am incapable of mistrusting her, for I love my sister. She told me her name, but of course that is a secret. She wants to be free; sometimes I let her out, and other times she forces herself out. To her I attribute my preternatural youthful looks, and she is the reason we will see my 125th birthday. I have a twin sister, and I am never alone.
Hi all. I'm currently making a mix tape for work. That's right, a mixed cassette. This really is a lost art, I think, at least for me. It's been decades since I made a really good one, and most of the ones I've made for work seem somewhat off. The last tape I made I went with a two song in row from each artist format, which somewhat worked. This tape I might put the same artists on both sides, if I can work it. Currently I am listening to Sleater-Kinney's The Hot Rock to see which song has the right blend of energy, harmony, and non-offensiveness (note-wise) for work . I finally had a non immediate sense datum dream last night. I was on the top of a cliff, which was fairly smooth and level, but it ended abruptly to drop sheer down at least a kilometer. I was running along, about fifteen feet from the edge, enjoying the clear blue sky, the wonderfully fresh cool air, the general openness of the scenery. Then I saw a crack in the cliff that I had to jump over. It was only about two feet across, something that I could easily step over, but as I jumped over it I saw that the crack went all the way down, that if I fell in I would fall a kilometer to my death. I kept running, still somewhat exhilarated, but now also nervous a little, very much aware of just how freakin' high I was. I came to another crack in the cliff edge, and this time when I jumped it wasn't nearly so easy, my stomach clenched a little, my legs would barely jump at all. Still I ran, compelled god knows why. When I came to the next jump my gut clenched so forcefully I couldn't jump at all, I was so completely focused on the view down to the blurry green trees below (yes, I know, focused on something blurry). My momentum carried me over to the other side, but I couldn't move, I lay on the sun warmed rock, my diaphragm so clenched I couldn't breathe; this is how I woke up: in the grips of intense vertigo, my mind convinced that I was going to fall off the edge of my bed to my death. Now if only I had actually fallen, I probably would've floated down or something, then had an opportunity to fly. But no, just stupid useless dizziness and fear. I'm currently reading a somewhat nasty book by Francis Wheen called Idiot Proof. His goal is to reveal the stupidity of the media, of those in power, of us for supporting them, of fad religion and spirituality, fad economics, fad diets, whatnot. As he was detailing what was wrong with Thatcherism and Reaganomics I was with him, generally; at a certain point he turned irrelevantly mean and nasty: "Why [Deepak Chopra's] longevity formula failed to work for Princess Diana, with whom he lunched shortly before her death, remains a mystery." He grossly miscaricatured (this word looks wrong) several things that I know rather well. I really want to tear into this guy, but currently I am very tired. I think that I will wait until the next time I post; by then I will have finished the book, and he may redeem himself. I am guessing he willn't, as his main point seems to be that humanity isn't smart enough to avoid doing stupid things; big deal.
Well, that experiment went well. I proved that I am still romanticizing things with my ex-girlfriend, flutterby, and that my emotional state is volatile and prone to extremes. If you are wondering "what experiment?", good. You're lucky.
So my ex-girlfriend, Flutterby, calls me up. We're thinking about getting back together, and soon, but there was a snag: she hadn't called me for the last three weeks. The reason, I find out, is that someone told her I'd slept with N; I had to laugh when she told me this, as N is a good friend of mine and nothing more. She doesn't know anything about my friendship with N, though, and I didn't know someone had said this to her. I've been an emotional wreck for weeks, as I was all prepared to decide to move out to Vancouver where she lives, finally, but she wasn't callling. Well, now that we've talked, we seem to be back in a weird limbo state. Moving is now far off on the horizon, and the relationship seems more damaged then ever. Everything in me says "drop it", but we both have a hard time moving on. bleh. Now you have to hear about it. However, I'll be merciful, and save you from all of that maudlin stuff. I really do romanticize everything, don't I?
Like so many online, I am drawn to the spectacle that is American politics. As a Canadian, these things interest me far more than they should. For instance, why is it that practically every week I know most of the news that concerns the urlLink top 10 conservative idiots ? When did I become one of urlLink Atrios ' more regular readers? Why have I developed a morbid fascination with how many coalition soldiers have been urlLink killed in Iraq (this goes beyond my minor number fetish)? Do you too keep up with the blogging of urlLink Tom Tomorrow (if you don't, definitely read his urlLink archived comics)? This reading comes at the expense of reading urlLink more urlLink interesting urlLink things , unless I spend way too much time online. Frell, I even urlLink play / urlLink watch urlLink way urlLink too urlLink many urlLink flash urlLink games . And how did I forget urlLink this , of all things, when making these links the first time?! If you have got past level 22, let me know. When I was thinking of what exactly urlLink Whoopi 's joke about Bush might have been, the words " Animated Merkin " popped into my head. And I laughed! I don't know if anyone else has come up with this, and I am certainly not going to google for it, but if you know of anything, or are willing to look at a lot of unrelated merkin websites, let me know. In other news, I discovered while reading Karen Elizabeth Gordon's urlLink The Well-Tempered Sentence , that you don't need to use a question mark following a rhetorical question. She also agrees with me (and urlLink Lynne Truss ; warning: questionable punctuation game) about the proper placement of punctuation as concerns quotation marks. And even though Hmm. I saved this as a draft yesterday, no, the day before (umm, no), but apparently something got lost. I have no idea what I was going to write after that. Oh well. Hmm, I have a vague memory of leaving the entry unfinished like that, believing that I couldn't forget what came next. This memory may well be just one of those false beliefs the brain generates to make reality easier. I'd link to something brain-y and psychological/neurological, but you know all about that, right? Well, there are a lot of false beliefs people have about the brain and consciousness. Do I really want to get into it? I don't feel like playing a flash game, so maybe I will. First though, I will eat supper. Yes, I know that it is 10:40, but I am making a mix tape for work using songs I like from all my old urlLink CMJ CDs. Time consuming, listening to so many okay songs. So far I've only collected Elliott Smith, the Eels, and Amon Tobin. And like, this is a week later. That brain stuff is going to have to wait. Why do I not post more often? cause I suck? do I care? If you care about the line-up of the mix tape, email me. I finished it today, and called it Days of Sadness and Medication . There is some stuff on there I am totally unfamiliar with, but kinda like. Who are "Essex Green", and "My Favorite"? I guess I'll learn in a few days, thanks to urlLink Last.fm , your personal radio station (audioscrobbler fans should get excited, but not too much). -Starcat, uneasy without U.
Currently I have no cable TV. This isn't really all that bad, since the only show I really watch is The Daily Show, and CTV airs that. Oh, and Jeopardy, occasionally (even now that Ken is on his 36th win; you'd think that I'd tune in more often just so I wouldn't miss that moment of pop culture that will be him losing, but no). Even when I had cable, I discovered that I was watching not much more than music videos, terrible movies (especially the really bad ones, like crack they were to me - I watched Mangler 2, twice), and commercials. I love commercials. What's not to like, really. They are generally more arty than anything else on TV, non-linear seems to be in, I love guessing what product is being shilled (I am scarily good at this, though I have a sneaking suspicion that many of us are), and they are one of only a few mainstream outlets to hear new, good music (now that I don't have cable, maybe the only one; the two others before were the WB and the Wedge on Much). Oh, and I almost forgot about all the sexy people (how could I have forgotten about the sex?). There are bad commercials, though, and these come in two kinds* (well, if I stopped to think about this, there are probably more, but whatever. And a special category is reserved for Mel Farr, Superstar). The first is the kind that makes you shake your head and compose a better ad on the spot. We've all done this, and it doesn't take a marketing degree to add vitality and surprise to a bland commercial (I really am thinking about changing jobs, my virtual portfolio will make you laugh, I swear). The second kind of bad commercial I despise; it is so bad you have to change the channel when it begins, or else risk contamination. These ads are almost always local, and manage to be simultaneously boring and irritating, devoid of any creativity, and are generally insultingly terrible. Dating service commercials also fit in here, as there aren't any sexy singles waiting for my call at midnight on a Wednesday in my city, and if there are, how lame for them. Which brings me back to the start: during the Daily Show, which is on at midnight in my time zone, there are very, very terrible local ads, and I am shuddering just thinking about them. No, I won't mention them, but if you are from around here you probably know which I am talking about. Now, when you have cable, and a bad ad comes on, changing the channel is a wonderful option; almost too wonderful for me, as I am a typical male who channel surfs rather well, and sometimes forget to come back to the show I was originally watching. When you don't have cable, you don't have this option. Yet you must still change the channels, and simply must bear the brunt of what you find. At midnight, there are only two other channels (a fourth channel just does not come in at night on the rabbit ears). They are both CBC, and one is in English, and one is in French. Which brings me to my beef: CBC, what is up with your late night movie language policy? The following happens practically every night: On the English channel, a French movie will be playing, with subtitles; on the French channel, an English movie will be playing, dubbed into French. WTF!! I don't have a problem with French, or with the French channel (some of my friends are French..., ha!), it's just that I don't know it that well, despite a minimal desire to learn (cause I actually do have French friends). I appreciate that CBC is playing French movies, and I love that they are subtitled, because I hate dubbing: this is beside the point. CBC programmers, why can't you put the English movie on the English channel and the French one on the French channel? Most of us have closed captioning if we want the appropriate subtitles. Or, somewhat easier, maybe: Don't dub the English movie, just subtitle it into French; this will not only preserve whatever "education" goals you had in mind, but will extend them to the realm of teaching French spelling to the anglophones. I know return you to your regularly scheduled programming. *You've probably heard this one, which is why it's at the bottom: There are only two kinds of people in the world, those who think there are two kinds of people, and those who don't. Whenever I hear "there are two kinds...", this automatically pops in my head, and invariably pops out of my mouth. Sometimes I sex it up by sounding like Dorothy Parker, but this works better when I am drunk.
Except this blogger account isn't so nice. How come I can't fucking cut and paste any more? What the frell is going on? ah. If I click on the "edit html", then it will let me do the simplest of things. at least it wasn't complicated or anything. But seriously, why have the default mode be one wherein you can't paste-in information from elsewhere? Anyways. Because ads are so pervasive, and so always on the right in that easy to ignore column, I never look at that column, even when it isn't ads (except if it is flashing at me, but this just makes me want to go all Unibomber on their ass). Except today, in my gmail inbox. Now, when gmail first came out, there was many an angered grunting at the way google was going to "read" the content of your email to glean your interests for targeted advertising. I said: Awesome! finally, relevant ads; goddness knows that I am tired of ads that are trying to date me, sell me cars, etc. But did I believe that this would be so? How much did I need to email before the content filters would feel confident enough to stop selling me sex and cars? (I know tonite she comes...) Well, it turns out to be not that much. I have only been using my gmail account for about 5 days, but the ads to the right were right on the money (is there a pun here? sorry if you see one). They are trying to sell me music, and not just any music, but good indie music. Not that music has to be "indie" to be good. In fact, I'm not really sure what "indie" means. Something like: interesting, different, eclectic, lo-fi, low budget. If google lets me know about a band signing to Barsuk, does that mean that the band in question, and the label, can no longer be "indie"? Whatever, I'm not interested at all in Indie politics or concerns. I just want to listen to good music. And my emails reflect this. As I climb out of the seemingly endless hole that was my musical ignorance (recent acquisitions: Raising the Fawn - the North Sea ; A.C. Newman - the slow wonder ; Mission of Burma - onoffon ; King Cobb Steelie - destroy all codes ), I find that a fair chunk of my correspondence is about what music we are listening to (bands I need to listen to: the Fiery Furnaces, Ugly Casanova, the Books). And over on the right, when gmail saw fit to advertise, there were three ads for interesting music websites. I happened to have all three bookmarked already, so they weren't particularly useful, but it was thrilling to have reality vindicate my earlier snarkiness. Yeah! for relevant ads.
I went on a music purchasing binge the last few weeks. I've drastically cut down on my liquid medication bill, so I had to waste my "extra" money on something... Purchases include: The Apples in Stereo - Velocity of Sound; The Walkmen - urlLink Bows and Arrows ; Yo La Tengo - I can hear the heart beating as one; The Clash - London Calling; The Flaming Lips - urlLink The Soft Bulletin ; Wilco - a ghost is born; and you will know us by the trail of dead - source tags and codes; Tragically Hip - In between evolution; The Cure - s/t. Some pleasures here, some disappointments. The new Hip album is one of the disappointments, there doesn't seem to be anything that immediately catches my attention, just a lot of rock sounding music. Like most albums, I'll have to give it the six listen judgement, but I'd caution people to stay away from it. The same goes for the new Cure album. There are a few good songs, but absolutely no new ground is covered, and there are no songs with that wonderful pop hook they did so well in the 80s. And Robert, can you please stop writing songs about how you feel so fucking sorry for yourself? These are the moments when you are at your most trite. The Clash, Yo La Tengo, trail of dead, and the Lips are albums I've wanted for a while but haven't had the opportunity until now to pick up. I'm currently listening to the Walkmen. Did they have a song on a car commercial? The singer's voice sounds familiar. I first heard them on the mixed CD that came with the special music issue of the urlLink Believer . I could look it up, I suppose, but I'm too lazy right now. Okay, I looked it up, and the song was "We've been had" from Everyone Who Pretended To Like Me Is Gone , the commercial for urlLink S urlLink a urlLink t urlLink u urlLink r urlLink n (this planet, it has rings? hmm). Apples in Stereo I picked up because they are on the Elephant 6 label, home to Neutral Milk Hotel (enough of which lately I can not get). This one is quite good, but I have not the skill to tell you what it sounds like, as "hard-edged, fuzz guitar sugary pop" is not really anywhere close. Oh, and the new Wilco album is amazing. Ah, sweet work-filled weekend, how will I find time to sleep?
I read urlLink this great article: Tony Campolo, tells about a friend of his who made a career change. He says, "Some years ago, a friend of mine went to teach English literature at a state college. He was there for three weeks when he went into the dean's office to say that he was quitting. "I'm not coming back next week, and I thought you ought to know," he said. The dean replied, "If you walk out on your contract, you're not going to teach here again. What's more, you won't teach anywhere, if I can help it." Campolo goes on with the story, saying: After my friend left his job, his mother contacted me by phone and said I had to see him. She was sure he had gone crazy and hoped I could talk him into going back to his job. I found my friend Charlie living in an attic apartment in Hamilton Square, New Jersey. I must admit that his apartment had a certain style: travel posters all over the walls, a good assortment ofbooks scattered around the room, and the stereo playing a Wagnerian opera. I sat down in a beanbag chair that swallowed me up. After we exchanged niceties, I came to the point. 'What have you done?" I asked. "I quit," said Charlie. "I walked out. I don't want to teach anymore. Every time I walked into that classroom, I died a little bit." Campolo says: I could understand him. I'm a teacher, and I know what it's like to go into a class and pour out your heart to students, to let every nerve inside you tingle with the excitement ofyour most profound insights. I know what it's like to passionately share the struggles of your existence, to lay your soul bare in an attempt to communicate your deepest feelings. Then, when it's all over, some student in the back ofthe room raises his hand and says, "Do we have to know this stuff for the final?" (We have some teachers here who know that feeling! I'm sure Jesus must have experienced that plenty when He was teaching!) Anyway, Campolo goes on, saying: It wasn't long before I realized that Charlie was not about to go back into the classroom, so I asked him what he was doing with himself these days. He said, "l'm a mailman." Reaching back into the value system provided by the Protestant work ethic, I said to him, "Charlie, if you're going to be a mailman, be the best mailman in the world!" He said, "But I'm a lonely mailman. Everybody else who delivers mail gets back to the post office by about two o'clock. I never get back until six." "What takes you so long?" "I visit," said Charlie. "You'd never believe how many lonely people there are on my route who had never been visited until I became a mailman. What's more, now I can't sleep at night." "Why can't you sleep at night?" Charlie cried, "Have you ever tried to sleep after drinking fifteen cups of coffee?" Campolo says: As I sat and looked at my friend Charlie, I envied him. He was alive with the excitement that comes to a person doing something meaningful with his life. Because he moved from being a college professor to being a mailman, he has lost status. But what difference does that make? As Charlie invests himself significantly in the lives of other people, his is finding fulfillment in, as Scripture says in James 1:27, 'visiting orphans and widows in their distress." Is he a role ? Let’s be honest… no way. Ya like all our mom’s are telling their kids – you know, you should quit school and become a mailman… no way, it’s a great story but we want our kids to emulate rich successful people. Every mom wants their kid to be a doctor right? Here’s a question no one ever asks… why? Why the heck do they want their kid to be a doctor… to help people? That’s the standard answer but its crap. I think this really comes in line with my feelings that we've all got to live our lives to the max or else we slowly die inside... Sometimes I think i sound a bit like a broken record because, in my cell, i'm always telling the guys to "dream big, and don't stop." The truth is, I can't stop encouraging them to dream and live their dreams ... man I wish I couldn't get to sleep at night because i've spent so much time loving people...
it's urlLink snowing so much in Toronto, i just think things might come to an end. All this snow reminds me of some Norse Mythology; for them, the end of the world comes as a huge wolf gobbles up the sun and then everything gets quiet as a blanket of snow covers the whole world. Not sure if that's this afternoon but we just might be close...
May the power of your love, O Lord, fiery and sweet as honey, wean my heart from all that is under heaven, so that I may die for love of your love, you who were so good as to die for love of my love. Sir Francis of Assisi
reading urlLink jordocooper.com today and he posted the following by Reggie McNeal: "Fallout is not limited to the clergy... The faithful.. wonder when they are going to experience the changed life they've been promised and expected to experience at church. In North America, these people have been led to believe that their Christian life is all about the church, so this failure of the church not only creates doubt about the church, it also leads them to all kinds of doubt about God and their relationship with Him. "Many congregations and leaders.. adopt a refuge mentality. This is the perspective that withdraws from the culture, builds the walls thicker and higher, hunkers down to wait for the storm to blow over. Those with a refuge mentality view the world outside the church as the enemy [and] live within the bubble of Christian subculture.. Refuge churches evidence enormous self-preoccupation. They deceive themselves into believing they are a potent force. "The point is.. all the effort to fix the church misses the point. You can build the perfect church--and they still won't come. People are not looking for a great church... The age in which institutional religion holds appeal is passing away. Church leaders seem unable to grasp this simple implication of the new world--people outside the church think church is for church people, not for them." I think that's why it's so important to have smaller scale relationship... especially in the context of having large scale church. Without small-scale relationship building, there's no life and we're all just refugees. But when you have a home in the context of a large community, you can learn, grow, and contribute.
Ok it took a while to figure out, but I've finally added comments to my blog! woo hoo!
Was reading urlLink Kerismith's Blog this morning and she has this beautiful post about just seeing the beauty in everything: Last night I stopped in front of the local corner store. In the window I saw the owner talking to a customer. The customer was taking clementines out of a box and squeezing them, then putting them into another box. I saw the owner take a clementine, peel it open and then offer a piece to the woman. I could not hear anything of what was being said. It was like a scene from a movie, the way the light was, the colours, the snow, the quiet, and I had a front row seat. The act of peeling an orange for another person seemed so intimate and beautiful. And, yet I know in reality it may not have been, (was she complaining?) But something about the whole image summed up something so simple, an everyday task, an interaction with another human being. I watched as the woman left the store with a box of clementines and bag of Tender Vittles. I love how she just puts the mystery in the everyday. God spoke to me a whole bunch about this kind of stuff last year. My fruit of the spirit that i was working on was gentleness and a large part of my learning came from enjoying life. "Stop and smell the roses" and "take your time" were two important phrases last year. Plus He really spoke to me through a chapter in urlLink The Ragamuffin Gospel where Brennan Manning talks about wonder. I want to walk in wonder every day... drinking in the His beauty everywhere and in everything I do. I think that's kind of why I love watching the stars (when i get out of the city) because there's nothing i need to do; I can just take it all in. This all reminds me of this quote by urlLink David Crowder : You know in romantic comedies when the lead and their love interest are in the scene where they are at a dinner party with tons of other guests and conversation is going on all around them, some of which they are even involved in, for they are the leading couple, but then there is that moment. You know, the moment where the couple’s eyes lock. They communicate without any words spoken. Things no one else is aware of. They are still present with everyone else but they have checked out for a bit. This individual, romantic experience is had and no one else has any clue. There is something similar that happens in the corporate worship experience that is truly amazing and transcending. I mean we know that our convening with God is not confined to any specific moment of any specific day, so what makes, say, a Sunday morning any more special than a Tuesday in the middle of traffic on our drive home? Is God less present on Tuesday? No. Yet, there is something so different and other than when we are in a room full of people that have gathered in the name of Christ. But the thing that really sends my head spinning is that we can be in the middle of this corporate experience and feel like we have the sole attention of God. In the middle of a crowd, it’s just the two of us in this beautiful exchange. And these other individual’s voices who believe, no less than I, to have his total attention start to blend with mine. It doesn’t lessen my individual experience it only deepens and heightens the romance somehow. All of these individual voices blending to one. not sure if this is a really connected entry, but it's my thoughts today and i like where they're headed ;)
urlLink Study: Red Sea parting was possible - (United Press International) I love this article... sometimes, when science comes to partner with God's power, i get so excited...
urlLink Amazon.com: Books: Church in Emerging Culture: Five Perspectives I want this book. I'm reading some of urlLink Jordon Cooper's thoughts on the book and I've decided that I really want it. Leonard Sweet's always got something challenging to say; I'm really thinking about all this Emergent Church stuff lately. BUt there's a whole bunch of problems associated with growth (even though it's the most natural thing in the whole universe)... Like when we leave behind old wine skins, how do we move into new ones? Do we have to establish them? Do they establish themselves? Ok, i'm getting into my own circular argument...
urlLink Yahoo! News - Study: Sleep Essential for Creativity so my Mom's been telling me for as long as I can remember to "slow down... rest is important." And everybody knows that Mom, come on. but it looks like sleep's more essential than i thought... interesting article! i think i'll take a nap ;)
urlLink What Christian Theologian Are You? "Sin is incurable by the strength of man, nor does free will have any validity here, so that even the saints say: 'The evil which I do not wish, this I do.' 'You are not doing the things which you wish.' 'Since my loins are filled with illusions,' etc." You are Martin Luther! Yeah, you have a way of letting everyone know how you feel, usually with Bible quotes attached, and will think your way through the issues, although sometimes you make no sense! You aren't always sure of yourself, and you can change your mind about things, something you actually consider a strength. You can take solitude, especially with some music. i think that's a pretty good description of me, even with the scripture in your face stuff... LOL
urlLink Hillsong Music Australia looks like the new hillsong youth album is gonna rock (like it always does). i really admire their drive to produce good music and heartfelt worship. Plus i just love singing their songs...
just read this: urlLink Going Canuck "I need something to shake me from a recent nightmare. I was an actor on a movie shoot, in a bright white, mirrored shopping mall. There was a shootout, I thought it was part of the movie, but it was real, and I was shot. I died and went to hell. After a dark and bumpy ride down, down, down a dark red shaft in a rusty, wrought-iron elevator, I crash landed in a sunny suburb somewhere. No birds, no music, no sounds, and no people, just a gentle summer breeze. I went from house to house looking for someone, anyone. All I found were unfinished blueprints, unused airplane tickets, crumpled up music scores, and half-painted canvases. Dreams that'd never come true, for an eternity. Half-formed projects that'd never be completed. Creative yearnings that would never be satiated, ever. That was my hell. Sartre would be proud.

urlLink The Danger of Grace Without Truth by Andy Comiskey ok, just read this article, that Jan (from work) sent me... it's interesting. I have a few thoughts. He just dives into his response without giving us much of an idea of Manning’s thoughts. I like what he says about “cheap grace;” I’m not entirely sure what to think about situations like this. I mean, Comiskey’s come out of the garbage and death that he’s talking about, so I’m sure he’s got the authority to say some of the things he’s saying. On the other hand, I think sometimes the “church” tries to run from cheap grace and ends up running away from grace completely. I think I’m a Manning advocate (well at least an advocate of his writings.) I really like what Manning says in his books; I’ve never heard him condone any sort of sinful lifestyle… but more than encouraging us to get beyond our sin, his main message is to get in love with God. I think the deeper you get into God, the more he’s lead you out of a sinful lifestyle. God’s really big and I know he wants us to be free and pure more than any religious teacher, right? He’s the one who does all the work in our hearts. It’s interesting to hear how Manning feels about same sex relationships; I’ve heard Tony Campolo say similar stuff. Although I would say that grace and love are our only roles with people who struggle with this stuff (well, who struggle with anything) I also think we can’t condone the sin. I wish there was an easy answer for this, but there really isn’t. It’s good; this has got me thinking…
i found this really good opinion article on urlLink theheresey.com : My Postmodernity? I think (Postmodernity) really has a lot to do with losing faith in society and its values because society has failed so many. When one loses faith in so many things it isn’t much of a stretch to lose faith in everything. For me growing up in a home with one parent introduced me to injustice. I hated divorce with a passion and I didn’t think it was fair. As I grew up I began to see that there were great many of our social institutions that didn’t live up to their billing. When I became a Christian it wasn’t because I shopped around for religions and picked the one that suited me the best. I read the bible and God revealed Himself to me. It became clear to me that there was truth and that it could be found. Later on I realized that this truth is not found in many of the ways people seek it. When I started going to church it became readily apparent that only some of the people experienced what I had. Most of them knew Christ as a bunch of words on a page or a tradition to hold. I am "postmodern" in so much that I believe that modernity oversimplified the search for truth. It is inherently arrogant by assuming people observe things impartially. The moral decay in society isn’t the result of postmodernity. It is the result of modernity which detached people from the real source life change. Postmodernity is just modernity caving in on itself. The natural end to a flawed approach to truth. I don’t believe the church's best option is to abandon truth, discernment, or theology. I think the church's best option is to have integrity. People are looking for truth. Truth in more than just words, but in deed and life. It may offend them, but that is how the gospel works. By catering to a pick and choose culture we send an unspoken message. That message is "we really don’t know what we are doing" or "we really don’t know any better than anyone else." If that is indeed the case then why do we bother? I agree. “What is truth” really isn’t the question anymore. I guess the issue is how do we stir hunger in people to keep on searching?
wow, back from the encounter ...am tired but so happy and wow, i don't know why i'm so surprised when He just does amazing and wonderful things on encounters... but again, i am. i watched him break down barriers, bring hope, and release deep peace... Kenny and Gary (in my cell) spoke -- and they did an awesome job (i am so proud) i'm so thankfull that He has done so much Romans 6: 4 - 11 When we are lowered into the water, it is like the burial of Jesus; when we are raised up out of the water, it is like the resurrection of Jesus. 5 Each of us is raised into a light-filled world by our Father so that we can see where we're going in our new grace-sovereign country. 6 Could it be any clearer? Our old way of life was nailed to the Cross with Christ, a decisive end to that sin-miserable life - no longer at sin's every beck and call! What we believe is this: 7 8 If we get included in Christ's sin-conquering death, we also get included in his life-saving resurrection. 9 We know that when Jesus was raised from the dead it was a signal of the end of death-as-the-end. Never again will death have the last word. 10 When Jesus died, he took sin down with him, but alive he brings God down to us. 11 From now on, think of it this way: Sin speaks a dead language that means nothing to you; God speaks your mother tongue, and you hang on every word. You are dead to sin and alive to God. That's what Jesus did. thank you papa
getting ready for the encounter... things are coming together and I'm starting to get excited I'm just so ready to see Him show himself -- the strong, capable, beautiful, faithful God... come
As Kingfishers Catch Fire As king fishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame; As tumbled over rim in roundy wells Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name; Each mortal thing does one thing and the same: Deals out that being indoors each one dwells; Selves -- goes itself; myself it speaks and spells, Crying What I do is me: for that I came. I say more: the just man justices; Keeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces; Acts in God's eye what in God's eye he is -- Christ. For Christ plays in ten thousand places, Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his To the Father through the features of men's faces. Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844-1889)

trying to come to grips with what today symbolizes. Now i am not part of a following that overtly practices Lent, but I've been feeling all day like I need to give its significance some thought.

I'm not really sure if anyone's thoughts so far do it for me. I re-read T.S. Elliot's urlLink Ash Wednesday and it made me think a bit about how life is full and free and beautiful... but there will be one day when i will cease to draw air into my lungs. I will die and my Father saw to it that there would be more for me than death. I've been praying all day for some understanding about this. I think I found some when urlLink Alan Creech led me to think about urlLink Psalm 51 : 10 Create in me a clean heart, O God. Renew a right spirit within me. 11 Do not banish me from your presence, and don't take your Holy Spirit from me. 12 Restore to me again the joy of your salvation, and make me willing to obey you. 13 Then I will teach your ways to sinners, and they will return to you.
was reading urlLink McSpotlight and found some terrible excerpts from urlLink Fast Food Nation : ...the taste of McDonald's French fries, for example, has long been praised by customers, competitors and even food critics. James Beard, the legendary American gourmet, loved McDonald's fries. Their distinctive taste does not stem from the type of potatoes that McDonald's buys, the technology that processes them, or the restaurant equipment that fries them. Other chains buy their French fries from the same large processing companies, use Russet Burbanks and have similar fryers in their restaurant kitchens. The taste of a fast-food fry is largely determined by the cooking oil. For decades, McDonald's cooked its French fries in a mixture of about 7% cottonseed oil and 93% beef tallow. The mix gave the fries their unique flavour - and more saturated beef fat per ounce than a McDonald's hamburger. Amid a barrage of criticism over the amount of cholesterol in its fries, McDonald's switched to pure vegetable oil in 1990. The switch presented the company with an enormous challenge: how to make fries that subtly taste like beef without cooking them in tallow. A look at the ingredients now used in the preparation of McDonald's French fries suggests how the problem was solved. At the end of the list is a seemingly innocuous yet oddly mysterious phrase: "natural flavour". That ingredient helps to explain not only why the fries taste so good, but also why most fast food - indeed, most of the food Americans eat today - tastes the way it does. The McDonald's Corporation will not reveal the exact origin of the natural flavour added to its French fries. In response to enquiries from Vegetarian Journal, however, McDonald's did acknowledge that its fries derive some of their characteristic flavour from "animal products." Other popular fast foods derive their flavour from unexpected sources. Wendy's grilled chicken sandwich, for example, contains beef extracts. A typical artificial strawberry flavour, such as that found in a Burger King strawberry milk shake, contains the following ingredients: amyl acetate, amyl butyrate, amyl valerate, anethol, anisyl formate, benzyl acetate, benzyl isobutyrate, butyric acid, cinnamyl isobutyrate, cinnamyl valerate, cognac essential oil, diacetyl, dipropyl ketone, ethyl acetate, ethyl amyl ketone, ethyl butyrate, ethyl cinnamate, ethyl heptanoate, ethyl heptylate, ethlyl lactate, ethyl methylphenylglycidate, ethyl nitrate, ethyl propionate, ethyl valerate, heliotropin, hydroxyphenyl-2-butonone (10% solution in alcohol), a-ionone, isobutyl anthranilate, isobutyl butyrate, lemon essential oil, maltol, 4-methylactophenone, methyl anthranilate, methyl benzoate, methyl cinnamate, methyl heptine carbonate, methyl naphthyl ketone, methyl salicylate, mint essential oil, neroli essential oil, nerolin, neryl isobutyrate, orris butter, phenethyl alcohol, rose, rum ether, g-undecalactone, vanillin and solvent. The new enzyme-based processes are responsible for extremely lifelike dairy flavours. One company now offers not just butter flavour, but also fresh creamy butter, cheesy butter, milky butter, savoury melted butter and super-concentrated butter flavour, in liquid or powder form. The development of new fermentation techniques, as well as new techniques for heating mixtures of sugar and amino acids, have led to the creation of much more realistic meat flavours. Cochineal extract (also known as carmine or carminic acid) is made from the desiccated bodies of female Dactylopius coccus Costa, a small insect harvested mainly in Peru and the Canary Islands. The bug feeds on red cactus beries, and colour from the berries accumulates in the females and their unhatched larvae. The insects are collected, dried, and ground into a pigment. It takes about 70,000 of them to produce a pound of carmine, which is used to make processed foods look pink, red, or purple. Some strawberry yoghurt gets its colour from carmine, and so do many frozen fruit bars, sweets and fruit fillings, and Ocean Spray pink-grapefruit juice drink. ...shudder...
so I went to a gigantic wedding Saturday night and it was completely not what I expected. I have a gigantic family (hence the wedding size). To give you an idea, each of my four grandparents come from families of at least 10 children. Now each of my great aunts and uncles each had at least 5 children (my mom and dad's generation) and each of them had at least 2 or 3 children (my generation)... the wedding was from my maternal grandmother's side (we had over 250 people just from our side of the family). these things are usually pretty sketchy to begin with: lots of people trying to impress each other, tons of rich Italians, and at least one major fight. This wedding had all that fun stuff but it's never all bad; a ton of good food and wine, plus some of my crazy uncles and cousins giving speeches and dancing... it was pretty good overall. The thing that really amazed me was this ceremony that Greeks perfom; the father of the groom, the groom himself and my cousin (the beautful bride) link arms and begin to do this side-stepping dance to some slow Greek music. Then, one by one, about 150 family members (from his side) came up to them, pinned some cash to their clothes, spoke a blessing over them and joined the chain. By the end (about 30 mins later) there was this long chain that had coiled around itself a few times. I watched all this completely amazed. It was such a beautiful thing to see this public honouring as family members said (with their words and their wallet) "we believe in you, we bless you; grow, love, and build together." The whole ceremony was very intentional but also very innocent. In some ways, i think my heart longs for some of that in the church. The truth is, although the ceremony is ancient tradition, it was real and purposefull for the people involved. So many of my friends are practicing religious tradition that has no life; sometimes I wish they'd either overthrow that tradition (which isn't every easy in the church) or embrace the value in those traditions. at any rate, I wouldn't mid marrying a Greek girl Father... ;)

From urlLink The NIV Application Commentary - Genesis (p.189): 1. We must be willing to preserve a godly perspective on the issue and accord Christian respect to those we disagree with, refusing to belittle, degrade, accuse, or insult them. Ad hominem arguments and other varieties of "negative campaigning" should be set aside. 2. We must not allow our differences of opinion to overshadow and disrupt the effectiveness of ministry and our Christian witness. 3. We must decry the arrogance that accompanies a feeling of self-righteousness and portrays others as somehow less godly because of the position they hold. Man, I'm so bad at doing this the correct and loving way sometimes... Thank God for friends who are full of grace (and sometimes as stubborn as I am). via urlLink Dashhouse .

urlLink Dashhouse has a really good quote (i know, i know, enough of the quotes today {notice the plural noun Pudd??}) about the Sabbath: Remember, Sabbath is a gift to us from God.

Unfettered and unbusy time to enjoy you, to show you his love. Time to make you a champion at living. Reggie McNeal, A Work of Heart
been finding a whole bunch around the net lately... Even in the best of health we should have death always before our eyes so that we will not expect to remain on this earth forever, but will have one foot in the air, so to speak... When I preach I regard neither doctors nor magistrates, of whom I have above forty in my congregation; I have all my eyes on the servant maids and on the children. And if the learned men are not well pleased with what they hear, well, the door is open. Faith is a living, daring confidence in God's grace, so sure and certain that a man could stake his life on it a thousand times. To gather with God's people in united adoration of the Father is as necessary to the Christian life as prayer. Who loves not women, wine and song remains a fool his whole life long. You should not believe your conscience and your feelings more than the word which the Lord who receives sinners preaches to you. And Martin Luther King Jr. said, If a man hasn’t discovered something that he will die for, he isn’t fit to live.

Well here it is, the top ten list of things going on inside of me this past Valentines weekend: 1) decided to get back in shape (my Christmas pudge hasn't left yet) 2) thought i had kicked performance out of my life, but after Friday night, i'm not so sure any more because i wanted to die after worship 3) longing for outdoor space as I'm trying to read urlLink Celebration of Discipline and I really want to learn how to meditate from a Christian perspective 4) had a good time with Gary on Saturday at urlLink Ikea .

Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. ... been thinking about Kate's message to our cell last Thursday. She said some really good stuff about how God's peace means wholeness and fullness and rest. 6) kinda feeling alienated from friends but i think that's a good thing right now because somethings going on in my heart and it hurts ... it's really pushing me towards Him though 7) my sister and I have had some communication problems lately which majorly sucks; she's on reading week, so i'm hoping the rest for her will mean peace for us 8) spoke on Sunday morning and surprised myself at how much of the word is really hidden in my heart; Holy Spirit brought a whole bunch right back as I spoke on growing as a leader and being committed to the process of growing (yes, I see the irony) 9) dynamics in my cell are weird right now; i'm praying for balance 10) I really love God more than my life; i think the good thing about going through rough stuff in life is that it renews my perspective. There is nothing else that satisfys or fills me. There will never be anyone who could take His place. Living for him and with him is the only way i want to live...

Chocolate is a number one Valentine's gift, but it's heartbreaking for most cocoa producers and their families. Cocoa farms are home to widespread child labor and even child slavery, especially in West Africa where most cocoa comes from. The U.S. chocolate industry has developed a plan of action but it still keeps producers too poor to cover labor or basic needs. The real solution is fair trade, which gives cocoa farmers the minimum price they need to send their kids to school, pay their workers, and live with dignity. urlLink M Mars, the world's biggest chocolate company, has refused to sell Fair Trade Certified chocolate despite an outcry from chocolate lovers of all ages.

Linda Cho was saying that it's interesting how there are 31 days in (most) months and Proverbs has 31 chapters. urlLink Proverbs 12: 1 If you love learning, you love the discipline that goes with it - how shortsighted to refuse correction! 2 A good person basks in the delight of God, and he wants nothing to do with devious schemers. 3 You can't find firm footing in a swamp, but life rooted in God stands firm. 4 A hearty wife invigorates her husband, but a frigid woman is cancer in the bones. 5 The thinking of principled people makes for justice; the plots of degenerates corrupt. 6 The words of the wicked kill; the speech of the upright saves. 7 Wicked people fall to pieces - there's nothing to them; the homes of good people hold together. 8 A person who talks sense is honored; airheads are held in contempt. 9 Better to be ordinary and work for a living than act important and starve in the process. 10 Good people are good to their animals; the "good-hearted" bad people kick and abuse them. 11 The one who stays on the job has food on the table; the witless chase whims and fancies. 12 What the wicked construct finally falls into ruin, while the roots of the righteous give life, and more life. Wise People Take Advice 13 The gossip of bad people gets them in trouble; the conversation of good people keeps them out of it. 14 Well-spoken words bring satisfaction; well-done work has its own reward. 15 Fools are headstrong and do what they like; wise people take advice. 16 Fools have short fuses and explode all too quickly; the prudent quietly shrug off insults. 17 Truthful witness by a good person clears the air, but liars lay down a smoke screen of deceit. 18 Rash language cuts and maims, but there is healing in the words of the wise. 19 Truth lasts; lies are here today, gone tomorrow. 20 Evil scheming distorts the schemer; peace-planning brings joy to the planner. 21 No evil can overwhelm a good person, but the wicked have their hands full of it. 22 God can't stomach liars; he loves the company of those who keep their word. 23 Prudent people don't flaunt their knowledge; talkative fools broadcast their silliness. 24 The diligent find freedom in their work; the lazy are oppressed by work. 25 Worry weighs us down; a cheerful word picks us up. 26 A good person survives misfortune, but a wicked life invites disaster. 27 A lazy life is an empty life, but "early to rise" gets the job done. 28 Good men and women travel right into life; sin's detours take you straight to hell. I guess there's no sense in living in fear. I want to learn the lessons God's got for me... even when they're difficult. I won't stop growing and I won't stop loving, even though it hurts. Oh well, here's a urlLink cool pic of salmonella .
Had an amazing cell tonight with my guys. I led a short talk on purity that was based on urlLink Galatians 2:20 "I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me. It's amazing how much power there is when we realize that we're all dead meat. I read most of the chapter from The Message and it provided so much insight for discussion. I especially liked urlLink verses 15 to 21: 15 We Jews know that we have no advantage of birth over "non-Jewish sinners." 16 We know very well that we are not set right with God by rule-keeping but only through personal faith in Jesus Christ. How do we know? We tried it - and we had the best system of rules the world has ever seen! Convinced that no human being can please God by self-improvement, we believed in Jesus as the Messiah so that we might be set right before God by trusting in the Messiah, not by trying to be good. 17 Have some of you noticed that we are not yet perfect? (No great surprise, right?) And are you ready to make the accusation that since people like me, who go through Christ in order to get things right with God, aren't perfectly virtuous, Christ must therefore be an accessory to sin? The accusation is frivolous. 18 If I was "trying to be good," I would be rebuilding the same old barn that I tore down. I would be acting as a charlatan. 19 What actually took place is this: I tried keeping rules and working my head off to please God, and it didn't work. So I quit being a "law man" so that I could be God's man. 20 Christ's life showed me how, and enabled me to do it. I identified myself completely with him. Indeed, I have been crucified with Christ. My ego is no longer central. It is no longer important that I appear righteous before you or have your good opinion, and I am no longer driven to impress God. Christ lives in me. The life you see me living is not "mine," but it is lived by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. 21 I am not going to go back on that. Is it not clear to you that to go back to that old rule-keeping, peer-pleasing religion would be an abandonment of everything personal and free in my relationship with God? I refuse to do that, to repudiate God's grace. If a living relationship with God could come by rule-keeping, then Christ died unnecessarily. all my guys agreed, we don't even want to move one inch in our own lives; the life we now life is completely in Jesus; there's no room for will-power or for trying to make the Kingdom happen in my life because urlLink I'm dead meat... I'm dead to myself, but very alive in Jesus, and hidden in God. It was just so great that this truth (that I've read so many times) became something dynamic for us. Keep on leading us into more truth Holy Spirit. Our first duty as Christians is to get ourselves happy in God. --Puritan saying
I missed all of the Grammy Awards last night because I'm not watching TV right now. no wait, that's a lie. I missed the venerable music awards because i didn't want to watch them... so I guess, I really didn't miss anything. Here's urlLink the complete list of this year's winners. I'm just so not into all the hype and the fake emotion any more. And with all the drama surrounding NippleGate, I can't imagine how they actually produced the show.

When I see other people using those same talents for no good, it turns me right off.
urlLink TheHeresy.com has a really good post based on "tract" evangelism. This is especially good: ... following Christ is more like a marriage than signing up for a cell phone plan. With a marriage we carefully consider whom we are going to be with. The commitment we make is lasts our entire life and it encompasses all aspects of our life. But that isn't how we spread Christianity today. Today becoming a Christian is much more like signing people up for a cell phone plan. Sign up today and get a free phone. The real cost of the phone in the monthly service plan. Unfortunately people can drop out of this contract at any time. I believe the issue of the gospel is crucial because there are subtle differences between following Christ and following the values of a subculture. There are many people in the church that don't know Christ. They are just living out the values they absorbed from others in the church. No more people joining our club. I want to grow lovers in my cell and in my circle of influence. Father help me be a farmer and not a sales associate...
was reading urlLink Brian McLaren's site and he had this quote by Ed Chin: "'... in my own devotional time this morning, I read John 3:31-32: The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. He testifies to what he has seen and heard... ( The Message translates this passage as: "The earthbound is earthbound and speaks earth language; the heavenborn is in a league of his own. He sets out the evidence of what he saw and heard in heaven...") 'The primary reason I ever attend a church service (or, frankly, even have serious or long conversations with Christians) is the hope that I will hear something proclaimed out of heaven, something that carries the majesty, the revelation, the heart and breath of God. I want my heart to burn with a word from Heaven. I want to hear something which rumbles through the corridors of His chamber and then creates a sonic boom when it enters my earth space. I am not interested in a 3-point guide for living or recycled Oprah or political perspectives or even a Bible study or exploring "styles of worship." And, I'm not looking for more apologetics and theology. 'I want the sound of Heaven to invade my heart, scare the hell out of me, and split me wide open. I want my "Edness" to spill out on the ground and for Him to take up residence in the suddenly empty vessel. 'We all know that the more traditional churches live in a ghetto of unreality; they speak only to themselves, write books for themselves, and make music for themselves. No one else has any clue what they're saying. That's why serious people have been ignoring them for a couple of decades. 'While I appreciate the freshness and youthfulness of "the emergent church" (or "postmodern church movement" as some call it), sometimes I think they have simply become better conversationalists. They’ve learned the language and the concepts of the natives and are very good about engaging them in real conversations. I greatly admire and enjoy that. But, very honestly, I’ve not heard very much in that world that really testifies of anything seen in Heaven. Like most other church worlds, they speak from a distinct “earthview” and in a distinct earth-language." I don't want that to be said of me. i don't want to become so impressed with my desire to create something relevant that my words and lifestyle become impotent. I think this is why the renewal is so revolutionary; you have people experiencing raw God and yet, he won't let that experience ever fit into an established wineskin. Brian McLaren says, "[the Emergent movement] could just become another marketing gimmick to sell books, build egos, and bolster sagging spirits with a new invisible wardrobe for a pudgy, pasty old emporer. No doubt, in some quarters it will squander its potential, but if you care about the possibilites being actualized ... please ... let's aim deep and high." I think it's God Himself that drives us on towards new expressions of Heaven and of Him. His bride is too important, I just know that He would never let her stray too far from Him.

ever wonder what urlLink Heaven is like? When the baby died, the angels carried him up to Heaven and rested him gently on a cloud. A man was there, also new, and they decided to tour Heaven together. 'Tell me about yourself,' said the baby, trying to put the man at ease. 'I was old. I died in my sleep. I had a long life, so I can't complain.' The man looked at the little baby before him. 'You, though. How could God let you die so young? It's cruel. It's unfair.' The baby just shrugged. They walked on. As the man walked, he grew angrier and angrier at God. 'How could God bless me with such a long life, and give this little one nothing? What did I do to deserve so much and him to deserve so little? How could God be so unfair? When I see God, I'm going to demand that he explain himself.' They continued walking, and finally they spotted God, who was taking a walk. Despite his anger, the man prostrated himself before God. The baby smiled and wiggled his toes. God welcomed them both. 'I don't want to question you, Lord, but something's bothering me,' said the man. 'I lived a long life. I had so many years, had so much happiness. Why did you deny this little baby such a life?' God looked at the man with kindness. 'Your pity is misplaced,' he finally said. 'It is not this child who deserves pity. Ask him about his life; get to know him. Then you will understand.' Then, embracing both of them, he walked away. The man was stunned. 'What on earth did that mean?' The baby only shrugged. Exasperated, the man said, 'Tell me about your life, then.' The baby grinned. 'Oh, it was wonderful there. Always warm. Everyone was so gentle, so kind. Everyone loved me. Whenever I was hungry, they fed me. When I was dirty, they cleaned me with warm water and soft touches. When I was lonely I had only to cry out and a beautiful woman would take me in her arms and rock me until I fell asleep." The man sighed. "Never to have known betrayal, or hatred, or deceit. I cannot imagine such a life." The baby looked around with the shock of recognition. "Come to think of it," he said, "it was a lot like this place!" heaven is given to the children, right?
well, i got into a car accident tonight. Even better, I had four of the guys in my cell in the car. Yeah, so my rear drivers side door is damaged (badly) and i think the rear driver side axel is bent ($$$$)... kind of sucks but I'm so glad there wasn't any damage to her car (other than some chipped paint). She was a really nice young lady and she totally wasn't looking to get anything out of me. I could totally see God's hand in all this though, it could have been much worse and his grace was over me a whole bunch in all of this. Plus Steve and Kevin both know tons about body work and they said they could help me out if I thought i was being ripped off by my body shop. Trying to decide what worship looks like right now. He is faithful and I can see that He was working in this. He's a big God and i believe he's going to do something BIG in all this. He is so good! His faithful love endures forever urlLink 2 Chr. 7:3 I trust you Father.
My friend Tracy says that cats are from the Fall. I agree. Now cats may have more than nine lives. The company that funded the first successful cloning of a domestic cat two years ago has gone commercial. An e-mail sent in early February to the company's gene-banking clients offered to clone up to six cats. The cost? U.S. $50,000 each. ...given that Animal shelters kill roughly four million animals each year because they're not adopted, The Humane Society of the United States feels cloning new pets should not be done. The group encourages people who want a cat or dog to adopt one from a local shelter. Can't believe this stuff. It's funny that dogs are more difficult to clone apparently (more brain matter). We're just getting closer and closer to the end of the world as I know it. Soon, they'll be cloning Donald Trump. I hope that bad toupeé isn't clone-able. Read the entire article urlLink here .

so very tired lately, i haven't been sleeping more than about 5 or 6 hours a night (which is really bad for me because i can't survive without sleep)... i think it's stress. some advice from urlLink About.com : How to improve your sleep Don't expect to fall asleep immediately after hearing or watching disturbing news. Stop watching or listening to news programs at least an hour before trying to go to sleep. Leave the war news (or other bad news on the TV or radio) in the living room or den and out of the bedroom. Engage in a relaxing, non-alerting activity at bedtime such as reading or listening to music. For some people, soaking in a warm bath or hot tub can be helpful. Avoid activities that are mentally or physically stimulating. Do not eat or drink too much before bedtime. Alcohol is not a sleep aid; don't use it to try to help you sleep. Only get into bed when you're tired. If you don't fall asleep within 15 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room and engage in a relaxing activity such as reading. Return to your bed when you're sleepy. Create a sleep-promoting environment that is quiet, dark, cool and comfortable. During the day: Consume less or no caffeine. Excess caffeine has the potential to disturb sleep at night. If you feel tired during the day, substitute a short nap of about 15-20 minutes for caffeine. Naps can relieve acute sleepiness and restore alertness, but for people suffering from insomnia, daytime naps should be avoided. Avoid alcohol and nicotine, especially close to bedtime. Exercise, but not within 3 hours before bedtime. ... good thing about the exercise because my butt is still in winter hibernation.
We spend an enormous amount of energy making up our minds about other people. Not a day goes by without somebody doing or saying something that evokes in us the need to form an opinion about him or her. We hear a lot, see a lot, and know a lot. The feeling that we have to sort it all out in our minds and make judgments about it can be quite oppressive. The desert fathers said that judging others is a heavy burden, while being judged by others is a light one. Once we can let go of our need to judge others, we will experience an immense inner freedom. Once we are free from judging, we will be also free for mercy. Let's remember Jesus' words: "Do not judge, and you will not be judged" (Matthew 7:1). from urlLink Nouwen.net via . urlLink Liquidthinking.org .

As i write this, i'm listening to the new urlLink In the Name of Love CD. It's actually really good! Nichole Nordeman's version of Grace is awesome and there's a couple of really fresh versions of some quality U2 stuff. I was talking to our Rep from urlLink CMC who told me that they've been having tons of trouble getting this CD into Canada. It's a really sucky situation. He said it almost looks like the only people who are going to be making money from this CD is Lawyers. Boo.

I just read an article from the updated urlLink Heart of Worship website. Matt Redman says some good stuff that has me dreaming again: One of the biggest obstacles to consistently fervent worship in a local church is that we miss the magnitude of the occasion. We focus in on the four walls surrounding us, and that becomes our reality. We see and hear a group of people in or out of tune with each other - sometimes passionate, at other times a little apathetic. And that becomes our whole reality. But there is a bigger picture to be seen. Most of us have found ourselves in the midst of a large crowd at some event or another. Whether it’s 5000 or 100,000 people, we experience an amazing dynamic when we’re part of that many gathered voices. ... let’s be honest, singing our hearts out in a home group setting with three or four of our less vocally talented friends just isn’t the same somehow. Or is it? Perhaps it can be, if we somehow in our spirits grasp the bigger picture. However small or large a gathering, however in or out of tune we are musically, we are joining with the eternal flow of praise that rise every moment before the very throne of God. ... Take a moment to put the sound of this worshipping choir into perspective. Imagine every language you’ve ever heard. Every accent and dialect. Every beautiful vocal sound. Add to that every harmony and every crowd, every choir, every large gathering. As these voices blend into one in your imagination, they are just the tiniest ripple of what is to come. One day every tribe and tongue will join this song. Multitudes and multitudes of passionate worshippers. Add now the sounds of all creation – every birdsong you ever woke to, every ocean wave you heard reach shore, every clap of thunder, every wild animal roar - and every time you experienced a wind whistling through the trees. Blend this sound with those cries of the nations, and the orchestration begins to take shape. Yet it is still a mere whisper. Find the whole article urlLink here .

Well, back from another awesome encounter... this time we were at the urlLink Ontario Camp for the Deaf which was stunning. Everything was frozen but it was so beautiful. I went for a (too) short walk on Saturday after a nap and was completely amazed at how much God's creation sings out his beauty and faithfulness. Made me think of urlLink The Darkling Thrush by urlLink Thomas Hardy I leant upon a coppice gate When Frost was spectre-gray, And Winter's dregs made desolate The weakening eye of day. The tangled bine-stems scored the sky Like strings of broken lyres, And all mankind that haunted nigh Had sought their household fires. The land's sharp features seemed to be The Century's corpse outleant, His crypt the cloudy canopy, The wind his death-lament. The ancient pulse of germ and birth Was shrunken hard and dry, And every spirit upon earth Seemed fevourless as I. At once a voice arose among The bleak twigs overhead In a full-hearted evensong Of joy illimited; An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small, In blast-beruffled plume, Had chosen thus to fling his soul Upon the growing gloom. So little cause for carolings Of such ecstatic sound Was written on terrestrial things Afar or nigh around, That I could think there trembled through His happy good-night air Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew And I was unaware. This poem's actually been on my mind for a while now. It's funny how creation just knows to trust Him. All creation looks expectantly to you to give them their meals on time. You come, and they gather around; you open your hand and they eat from it. If you turned your back, they'd die in a minute - Take back your Spirit and they die, revert to original mud; Send out your Spirit and they spring to life - the whole countryside in bloom and blossom. The glory of God - let it last forever! Let God enjoy his creation! He takes one look at earth and triggers an earthquake, points a finger at the mountains, and volcanoes erupt. Oh, let me sing to God all my life long, sing hymns to my God as long as I live! urlLink Psalms 104:25 - 33
Ok, the French are nuts ... Two top French nutritionists are telling people to go for a Big Mac and keep their fingers off the traditional French quiche. In an unexpected message to a country priding itself on the superiority of its food, a new food guide praises the McDonald's burger for having a higher and healthier protein-to-fat ratio than France's Quiche Lorraine. "Strangely enough, the products which are the most demonized are not necessarily the worst," Jean-Michel Cohen and Patrick Serog write in their book "Savoir Manger," in which they analyze 5,000 dishes available in shops and restaurants. The verdict published this month comes as McDonald's launches a new campaign to add healthier food choices to its menus. It has also said it is eliminating Supersize fries and soft drinks. urlLink Link

I once got in a pretty heated argument with one of my best friends about the prounication of equinox (past argumentativeness isn't something I'm proud of)... Anyway, I read this great article today. So, what's the meaning of "equinox"?? ... whether you are entering the season of light or darkness, don't be fooled into thinking that on the equinox the length of the day is exactly equal to the length of the night. It's not. The day of light and dark equality always happens before the spring and after the fall equinoxes, according Geoff Chester, a public affairs specialist with the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. "Exactly when it happens depends on where you are located on the surface of the Earth," he said. For example, in Washington, D.C., sunrise and sunset were exactly 12 hours apart on March 16. Solar balance occurred in Bogota, Colombia, on February 24. By the time the center of the sun passes over Earth's Equator (the official definition of equinox) the day will be slightly longer than the night everywhere on Earth. The difference is a matter of geometry, atmosphere, and language. And you better pronouncence it right, Jeremy... Read the whole article urlLink here .
Find a small pebble or stone and carry it around with you for a week. Use it to symbolise the things you are sorry for, or the things that are heavy and which you have been carrying around.

Ok, i just told urlLink Kenny that I was going to try and stay away from urlLink heavy posts this week but urlLink Pomomusings had a really good urlLink post about being at a dance competition: I found myself slightly amused at the few dancers from other groups I saw who had absolutely no idea what was going on. They were improvising the whole time, trying to follow others who were in the front lines. They were always a few steps behind - I couldn't help but laugh at them a little [maybe not a full-out laugh; more of a chuckle]. They were lost. Strugglers. And then I felt like an ass. Well, at least realized that I too am a struggler. I too am so often a few steps behind - struggling to find the beat, to get the moves down. We all are. We are dancers, trying to figure out the steps of life, the hand motions, the moves necessary to follow God - and we're not doing the best job at it. But somehow -- with the help of watching those who have the moves down a little better than us (or have been practicing more, or...hmm, maybe the Holy Spirit?) we're able to get through...to make it to the end... Pretty sweet truth. I had one of these moments yesterday at an extra long band rehearsal - I was ready to tell everyone what to do (even though i wasn't leading the practice)... Holy Spirit was quick to get things in check when I made a urlLink suggestion that sounded awful. It's good to swallow the humility pill and realize that I'm in the learning process too. I'm thankful for those times when i see my own ass-ness... it reminds me there's more to the journey and it keeps my heart urlLink humble .

I've found a new Blog that i really enjoy reading. urlLink Father Jake . He is a self-confessed eccentric and sometimes heretical Anglican priest... but I love the stuff he is saying. I think this may be appealing to the hunger for discipline that's growing in me. He had a really good post urlLink yesterday about Grace. He writes: When my youngest son was born, the nurse gave him to me to hold. I walked over to a corner of the room away from the bright lights, and rocked him in my arms as I whispered words of joy. He shook his tiny head, and struggled to open his eyes. We gazed into one another. Time stopped. Nothing but the flow of love between us existed. A moment of grace. A moment that seemed so natural, so spontaneous, and in some ways, so familiar. I had been to that place before. But I couldn't remember when, or where. As the years went by, the grace flowed. As love was given, it was now returned; not because I was such a perfect father, or the most handsome, or the smartest; but because I was Dad. This is the root of my understanding of our relationship with God. God is madly, head-over-heals in love with us, and woos us, and all of creation, into being, because we are. I have a hard time holding on to this foundational relationship. In day to day life, it doesn't fit very well. Head over there and read his discussion... I promise, it will make you re-evaluate grace. Grace She carries a pearl In perfect condition What once was hers What once was friction What left a mark No longer stains Because grace makes beauty Out of ugly things Grace finds beauty In everything Grace finds goodness In everything -U2
God's been doing a lot lately in me as I've been reading urlLink Celebration of Discipline still... I'm really hungry to have God establish more truth in my daily patterns of life. Read this and it resounded: Henri Nouwen, Lenten Reflections on the Prodigal Son Discipline is the human effort to create the space in which God can be generous and give you what you need. When you are fearful, worried, or anxious, you want to control your life and to hold onto the reins. You want to do it your own way, whether it's like the younger son or the older son. The practice of discipline is to let the Father touch you, let the Father forgive you, let the Father receive you. And for that you need to be available; you have to be home. You have to have an address if you want to be addressed. You have to be at home in order to receive a guest or to receive God. So disciplines are ways of creating a space, a home within, in which God can come into your life to forgive you, to heal you, and to bring you many gifts. The first discipline is listening. The word listening in Latin is audire. And if you listen with great attention the words are ob audire. That is the word for 'obedience.' The word obedience means listening. If you are not listening, you are deaf. The Latin word for deaf is surdus, and if you're actually deaf, you're ab surdus. The 'absurd' life is a life in which you're not listening. And obedient life is a life in which you are listening. Quote via urlLink Onehouse .
Was reading urlLink The Heresy today and Leighton Tebay said some real things about Church conflict: It’s been 8 years since I finished my 3rd year at bible college. I’ve watched many of my friends enter ministry and come out shattered and broken. Most of my closest friends that went in to ministry aren’t in ministry any more. They were so deeply wounded they changed their career. In many cases they were treated unfairly with very little regard for their feelings. Their critics were harsh and in some instances cowardly. There is a big problem with the way we handle conflict in the church. Some people feel they have the right to say whatever they want because it is the “truth”. Some people feel they have the right to say whatever they want because they have been victimized. What these people are not seeing is the profoundly negative impact their actions are having on the church in general. Those who can’t see beyond their interpretation of the truth or their own hurt feelings have neutered the leadership of the church. Some leaders are so deeply wounded that their faith in church and God is profoundly damaged. They leave ministry in tens of thousands of dollars of debt with no other marketable skills. For some they would rather make 8 dollars an hour than work in a church. Many of the leaders that do survive learn how to play politics and keep people happy but are completely ineffective at actually leading or challenging the church. Like most, I've experienced some awful church conflict in my time in Christendom. I don't quite know what it is that makes us buck against pastors and leaders when we don't approve of a decision or opinion (or when they don't agree with my opinion). I really like what Paul says in Ephesians 4:1-6 In light of all this, here's what I want you to do. While I'm locked up here, a prisoner for the Master, I want you to get out there and walk - better yet, run! - on the road God called you to travel. I don't want any of you sitting around on your hands. I don't want anyone strolling off, down some path that goes nowhere. And mark that you do this with humility and discipline - not in fits and starts, but steadily, pouring yourselves out for each other in acts of love, alert at noticing differences and quick at mending fences. You were all called to travel on the same road and in the same direction, so stay together, both outwardly and inwardly. You have one Master, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who rules over all, works through all, and is present in all. Everything you are and think and do is permeated with Oneness.
urlLink Jordon Cooper had this great quote by Henri Nouwen: "Freedom from judging, freedom for mercy We spend an enormous amount of energy making up our minds about other people. Not a day goes by without somebody doing or saying something that evokes in us the need to form an opinion about him or her. We hear a lot, see a lot, and know a lot.

Let's remember Jesus' words: 'Do not judge, and you will not be judged' (Matthew 7:1)" It reminds me of a story urlLink Pastor Steve Long , here at TACF, told once. The gist is that he was severly offended by someone. He went to God and said "I want justice... this is unfair. I haven't done anything wrong to this person God. They have no right to act the way they have." God said, "are you sure you want justice Steve?" Steve: "Yes!! This is not fair and I want what's fair." God: "Go to hell." Steve: "...ok, maybe I don't want justice Father."

it's my Happy Birthday! so, according to urlLink Encarta and urlLink Wikipedia , on this day 1834: Toronto, Ontario, (originally called York) is incorporated as a city. 1899: Bayer registeres aspirin as a trademark (i'm actually allergic to aspirin...) 1836: About 170 Texans perish at the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, when approximately 3,000 Mexicans commanded by general Antonio Lopes de Santa Anna overrun the Republic of Texas garrison. 1980: Novelist Marguerite Yourcenar becomes the first female member of the Académie Francçaise. 1981: Walter Cronkite, longtime anchor of the CBS evening news, signs off for the last time. Other people born on this day: Michelangelo, Italian painter, sculptor, architect, and poet (1475) Elizabeth Barrett Browning, English poet, political thinker, and feminist (1806) Valentina Tereshkova, Soviet cosmonaut and first woman to fly in space (1937) I also thought, since it's my day, I should post an amazing poem: Pied Beauty GLORY be to God for dappled things— For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow; For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim; Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches’ wings; Landscape plotted and pieced—fold, fallow, and plough; And áll trádes, their gear and tackle and trim. All things counter, original, spare, strange; Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?) With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim; He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change: Praise him. Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844–89) Poems , 1918. This is probably my favourite poem of all time... it reminds me to look for the beauty and the handiwork of God in everything. Even though this past year has had its challenges, I have seen my Father's love and grandeur in so many new ways... Here's to another year!
i know we've all been in this situation... but here's some urlLink fun things to do during boring sermons from urlLink Ian's Messy Desk .
you know you want to watch the entire trilogy urlLink here in about a minute... enjoy
Saw urlLink The Passion of the Christ on Sunday night. Man it destroyed me. There were a few times I felt like I was going to lose it... I mean, I was crying for most of the movie, but a few times I couldn't control the weird combination of grief and love that was building in my chest and I felt like I needed to either wail or explode. I didn't explode. The most difficult aspect of the movie was watching Jesus carrying his cross. Don't get me wrong, the scourging and the actual crucifixion were dreadful… but watching him drag the object that would mean his death was too much for me. At one point he falls and just as his mother comes over to him he says, “see Mother, I make all things new.” I had to describe it to a few friends and my sister on Monday and all I could say was that it was horrible and awesome. The torture and pain he suffered was apparent in a new and terrible way… and yet The Passion of the Christ I walked away thinking “that’s my Jesus…” and loving him so much more than ever. The only thing about this movie that makes me a bit disappointed is how some people are using it as a tool to shove the gospel down the throats of pre-believers. urlLink Paradox talks about his 2nd viewing of the film and how two guys got up and tried to do an altar call. I’m kind of torn on this. I felt like doing an altar call after I watched the movie and looked at the shocked faces of people leaving the theatre. I could tell they were recognizing not just the scope of what Jesus did but also the love present in that act. But for some reason the world (or at least my perception of it) tends to have a strong distaste for Christianity on the offensive . I did pray for them afterwards in the car and at Billy’s place that night. I’m hoping that for each one, there would be someone in their lives who could throw out a net that they would respond to. And I pray that Father would use this movie as a tool… in the same way he uses a sunset or his word or a death in the family or a street preacher to bring his children home.
"Lent can be more than a time of fasting; it can be a season of feasting. We can use Lent to fast from certain things and to feast on others." Lent is a season in which we can: Fast from judging others; feast on the Christ dwelling in them. Fast from emphasis on differences; feast on the unity of life. Fast from apparent darkness; feast on the reality of light. Fast from, thoughts of illness; feast on the healing power of God. Fast from words that pollute; feast on phrases that purify. Fast from discontent; feast on gratitude. Fast from anger; feast on patience. Fast from pessimism; feast on optimism. Fast from worry; feast on divine order. Fast from complaining; feast on appreciation. Fast from negatives; feast on affirmatives. Fast from unrelenting pressure; feast on unceasing prayer. Fast from hostility; feast on nonresistance. Fast from bitterness; feast on forgiveness. Fast from self-concern; feast on compassion for others. Fast from personal anxiety; feast on eternal truth. Fast from facts that depress; feast on verities that uplift. Fast from discouragements; feast on hope. Fast from lethargy; feast on enthusiasm. Fast from thoughts that weaken; feast on promises that inspire. Fast from shadows of sorrow; feast on the sunlight of serenity. Fast from idle gossip; feast on purposeful silence. Fast from problems that overwhelm; feast on prayer that undergirds. from a Benedictine website as quoted in The Tablet, 3 March 2001, p. 325 via urlLink Jordon Cooper via urlLink Grace Lent Blog .
My urlLink sister downloaded a urlLink virus yesterday on my home computer and it's a beast. She's been looking for a full-time summer job lately and she's sent out tons of resumeés... yesterday afternoon she received an email (from an unknown email address) with just the text, "here's your application"... and an attachment (which was actually a virus). I thought all well-meaning computer amateurs would know to NEVER open an attachment from someone you don't know. Anyway, i spent about an hour cleaning up my hard drive last night.

The images, which were revealed at a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, DC today, reveal a man- made structure at the site where the Bible states Noah's Ark came to rest. The first pictures of the site, taken by the U.S. Air Force in 1949, revealed what seemed to be a structure covered by ice, but were held in a confidential file labeled "Ararat Anomaly" for years. In 1997, the government released several of these images, but experts deemed them inconclusive. The summer of 2003 provided a great opportunity to take a new series of photographs. It was the hottest summer in Europe since 1500, which caused a massive meltdown on Mount Ararat. It's a really good article. It's also interesting that the American Government has kept the info secret for a long time. Read the whole thing urlLink here .
It’s the soft underbelly of church that I love. Most churches have a soft side, but it’s hard to see it because of the hard lacquer of organization and marketing that forms over time. If you let this shell get thick enough, it almost seems like the shell is all you have. And that’s not what church should be. One of our goals for our church is to keep this veneer from forming. We want to keep the soft things exposed because the soft things are the truth and all that really matters. It takes a lot of intentional work to stay soft. It makes us vulnerable and even weak. It makes us unorganized and a little messy. It makes us children in the Great Kingdom. Tru Dat. from urlLink Real Live Preacher .
Now there are four little boys at our church, all about the same age, all hovering around three. Kevin, Steven, Jacob, and Adam. And a merrier band of swashbuckling fellows you've never met in all your life. I want you to imagine the four of them, arms around each other's shoulders, fists full of toy trucks, plastic swords shoved in their belts, singing at the top of their lungs because the world is a great place and everyone loves them. Imagine that and you’re getting the picture. This is awesome because i think every man has one of these guys inside (whether they know it or not). It also reminds me of my amazing mates (Billy and Adam) and how hanging with them just makes me want to climb stuff, laugh, and be a son to my pop. from an amazing urlLink story (Real Live Preacher).

Give up something that matters Close your eyes for a moment and think of something that you just can't live without. Your morning cup of latte? How about that gin and tonic after work? Or your favourite television programme?. Make a pact with yourself that starting right now, you will forego that pleasure for an entire week (or a month, in the case of a weekly activity). Don't wait for Monday or any other "right time". Just do it now. Tell God your plans and ask for his help in sticking with it. And when it's time for that latte or television program, have a quick chat with God about it or anything else that comes into your mind. Note: Fasting normally involves abstaining from meals or specific foods for a certain length of time – for example, not eating at all for 24 hours or skipping lunch for a week. Health considerations are important, so if you have an eating or metabolic disorder, fasting from food is not an option for you. There are other ways to fast, though. Soap operas, shopping for little luxuries and eating chocolate are all good targets for fasting! And then there's silence. How about no talking for an hour, or even a day? Try to spend the time you free up to give something to others – write a letter, run an errand, send an email or pray for them. "When you go without eating, don't try to look gloomy as those show-offs do when they go without eating. I can assure you that they already have their reward. Instead, comb your hair and wash your face. Then others won't know that you are going without eating. But your Father sees what is done in private, and he will reward you." Jesus, in Matthew 6:6-18 From urlLink ReJesus .
Looks like Shakespeare's coined words (including the two in this post's title) are now common currency... While William Shakespeare died 388 years ago this week, the English playwright and poet lives on not only through his writings, but through the words and sayings attributed to him that still color the English language today. Some Shakespeare-coined phrases: • Eaten out of house and home • Pomp and circumstance • Foregone conclusion • Full circle • The makings of • Method in the madness • Neither rhyme nor reason • One fell swoop • Seen better days • It smells to heaven • A sorry sight • A spotless reputation • Strange bedfellows • The world's (my) oyster Really interesting article (ok ... maybe it's only interesting for English-buffs like me).

I'm having a Robert Frost day today so I decided to post some of my favourites: Meeting and Passing As I went down the hill along the wall There was a gate I had leaned at for the view And had just turned from when I first saw you As you came up the hill. We met. But all We did that day was mingle great and small Footprints in summer dust as if we drew The figure of our being less that two But more than one as yet. Your parasol Pointed the decimal off with one deep thrust. And all the time we talked you seemed to see Something down there to smile at in the dust. (Oh, it was without prejudice to me!) Afterward I went past what you had passed Before we met and you what I had passed On Looking Up By Chance at the Constellations You'll wait a long, long time for anything much To happen in heaven beyond the floats of cloud And the Northern Lights that run like tingling nerves. The sun and moon get crossed, but they never touch, Nor strike out fire from each other nor crash out loud. The planets seem to interfere in their curves But nothing ever happens, no harm is done. We may as well go patiently on with our life, And look elsewhere than to stars and moon and sun For the shocks and changes we need to keep us sane. It is true the longest drouth will end in rain, The longest peace in China will end in strife. Still it wouldn't reward the watcher to stay awake In hopes of seeing the calm of heaven break On his particular time and personal sight. That calm seems certainly safe to last to-night. The Vantage Point If tires of trees I seek again mankind, Well I know where to hie me--in the dawn, To a slope where the cattle keep the lawn. There amid loggin juniper reclined, Myself unseen, I see in white defined Far off the homes of men, and farther still, The graves of men on an opposing hill, Living or dead, whichever are to mind. And if by noon I have too much of these, I have but to turn on my arm, and lo, The sun-burned hillside sets my face aglow, My breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze, I smell the earth, I smell the bruisèd plant, I look into the crater of the ant.

I should be content to look at a mountain for what it is and not as a comment on my life David Ignatow from urlLink Wagler .
was reading urlLink Liquidthinking before work this morning and was taken aback by some thoughts, I don't know what to do with things like "Turn the other cheek"; "Sell your possessions and give to the poor"; "I came not to bring peace but a sword"; and "Don't worry about tomorrow"? I don't think Jesus was kidding, so what the heck I'm I supposed to do with it all? We are so quick to judge. Next time you're tempted to think a bad thought about someone, just remember you don't know what they are facing in life and you don't know what you might be like if you were in their situation. Take the time to know someone's story, then, when you might possibly have the right to judge you probably won't want to anyway. What would it be like if the criteria for telling someone about Jesus was that you must be willing to die for them? What would that change? Paul said that if his being cut off from Christ meant that his Jewish brothers could find salvation, he would do it...can you imagine that? I've often thought, how far would I go to show God's love. I mean, I've said urlLink I would die for my faith but if I was actually faced with that situation I wonder if my passion would still be strong... Also, all that stuff about turning the other cheek and selling my possessions is really easy to teach but really difficult to live. Recently, someone told a half-truth and it ended up looking like urlLink my sister had made decisions that were not hers to make (here at church… sorry if that sounds unclear). Basically, she was being used as a scapegoat and it made me really angry. Then yesterday, my good friend Sarah challenged me as I was sharing my frustration (read: urlLink gossiping ). Sarah : “I think you’ve picked up an offence Andrew.” Me : “Crap, I think you’re right.” It’s difficult to not pick up an offence when it’s someone you really care about. (That kind of sounds like I still want justice and not mercy… boo) Father, help me to live a urlLink lifestyle of urlLink forgiveness .

(1) people want to see a more honest reality, and the pomo [postmodern] church does that a little better than the modern church.. the latter finds itself too often being the answer dispenser, while the pomo church is more capable at showing the raw footages, the real angst of unanswered prayers, the reality of things not always turning out okay in a 30-minute sermon, the open ending, but yet real people holding on to hope, in God and in the community.. (cf. 1 Peter 3:15), let the camera's run 24/7 (2) life unscripted, let's see how things happen in real life, unrehearsed (3) The Apprentice is about business, nothing personal; The Church is about being/doing together, it is personal -- love one another is the big commandment from The One, regardless of chemistry or personality, we're in the Body of Christ, we share in The Family, we have to work together for The Mission.. (4) The Donald has bad hair and a coupla billions in the City; The Savior has great white hair full of wisdom, owns it all, and is building a New City, and says you're hired to do the best job for Him, and get the best perks as shareholders (cf.

The best things I've found though, is about Omarosa from urlLink USA Today Omarosa ... could host an Apprentice for divas. Whether trash-talking her competitors, overacting an injury or deliberately (or accidentally) sabotaging finalist Kwame, she's big enough to go by just one name. (If Trump gave her a company to run — perhaps into the ground — that would probably be worth a spinoff.) I guess her next stop will be Oprah.
So, I've now done the urlLink Life Languages test... and man is this stuff right on! I totally "borrowed" the table from urlLink Kenny ... This is my life languages breakdown. I'm a Shaper-Influencer-Producer-Responder. Language Score Rating Shaper 67.7% High Influencer 62.6% Moderate Producer 62.1% Moderate Responder 52.5% Moderate Mover 42.4% Moderate Doer 37.4% Moderate Contemplator 27.3% Low High Intensity 74.73 Range Moderate As a HIGH SHAPER, you tend to be organized, visionary, focused, delegating, strategic, and efficient. You can be quite articulate, especially when it comes to sharing your plans and vision. Generally, you can do this in a very persuasive manner, ensuring that others catch your vision. The Shaper's major desire is TO LEAD, and Shapers lead others automatically and naturally through planning and delegating. Shapers feel loved, valued, and motivated by receiving from others SUPPORT AND AGREEMENT: support in their plans and agreement of shared values, goals, purpose, and destiny. Shapers are not interested in agreement just for the sake of agreement, as would be the case with a "yes" person, but they are concerned with genuine compatibility of goals and direction. Because Shapers are generally in leadership roles, and leaders are often targets of criticism, they need the security and calm of safe, supportive relationships. It's all really interesting stuff. I really enjoyed doing the test and learning about the different types. I also learned a few ways I can improve: keeping sensitivity to people as well as the project, choose to trust others, taking time to relax, reflect, and relate.

I want the will of God. Lost something yesterday and was a bit disappointed. Even though it wasn't meant to be, I thought of this poem: One Art The art of losing isn't hard to master; so many things seem filled with the intent to be lost that their loss is no disaster. Lose something every day. Accept the fluster of lost door keys, the hour badly spent. The art of losing isn't hard to master. Then practice losing farther, losing faster: places, and names, and where it was you meant to travel. None of these will bring disaster. I lost my mother's watch. And look! my last, or next-to-last, of three loved houses went. The art of losing isn't hard to master. I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster, some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent. I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster. --Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture I love) I shan't have lied. It's evident the art of losing's not too hard to master though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster. Elizabeth Bishop from The Complete Poems 1927-1979

i was totally urlLink duped this morning by one of my good friends. the following is our email conversation this morning From: Sarah Dailey To: Andrew Gazaneo Subject: Sorry Hey Andrew, I have to tell you something and you have to promise not to be upset with me. I had to make a decision last night because Dave told me I can't move out. I'm going home. I leave a week from today. I've been thinking about it for a long time, and I don't know what I'm doing here anymore. I don't know how to tell the girls...I have to tell them today but I start to cry just thinking about what to say. Dave is ok with me leaving early. Since I've been here 6 months already he left it up to me what I wanted to do. Thanks for getting me so involved here..I'll really miss you Drew. Lets get together before I leave ok? Don't tell anyone yet. Sarah From: Andrew Gazaneo To: Sarah Dailey Subject: RE: Sorry Oh my gosh Sarah. Wow, that was really fast. I understand why though. Even though this is difficult, I really feel like the Lord is going to show you that you’re on the right path. Sarah, my amazing sister, I love you. When do you fly out? Andrew From: Sarah Dailey To: Andrew Gazaneo Subject: RE: Sorry My heart is killing me. I know it was crazy fast. Felt like a confirmation to me when Dave talked to me last night. Thank you so much for understanding...I know God is telling me to move back home. I'm really excited about it, and nervous all at once. I've learned so much from being here...I don't regret coming here, not for a second. I love you too Drew. My sweet friend. I'm not sure when I'm flying out. My mom is sending me a flight confirmation when she books the flight. She's paying for it obviously. Joanna and Nicola are still coming to visit me in May. That's gonna be amazing to see them. I don't wanna say goodbye...harden my heart..shut it down!!!! NO!!! From: Andrew Gazaneo To: Sarah Dailey Subject: RE: Sorry It sucks that you’re leaving, but DON’T SHUT YOUR HEART DOWN. NOPE. DON’T DO IT! I’M WARNING YOU. DON’T! Aww Sarah, it’s ok to say goodbye. And it’s ok for it to hurt too. See if you can at least stay for all of Fresh Wind, ok? Andrew From: Sarah Dailey To: Andrew Gazaneo Subject: RE: Sorry CRAP, I forgot about Fresh Wind. ARG. i have to call my momma. I don't think I'll work..I'll just go to the whole thing for free!! Yup. I have to go...I know you're sad I'm leaving. Pull it together man...suck it up. You'll get over it. =) Sarah From: Andrew Gazaneo To: Sarah Dailey Subject: RE: Sorry It really IS SAD… I wish there was some way you didn’t have to leave us Sarah. Have you told your girls? They must be bawling by now. This overall sucks from our perspective, but I really think God is going to lead you into even better stuff. I pray you have his peace today as you start to get things in order. Andrew From: Sarah Dailey To: Andrew Gazaneo Subject: RE: Sorry No, I told Sarah [her roommate] last night. She was kinda weird about it. Thanks for your prayers Andrew. We'll talk about it later. Maybe I'll just leave on Friday and tell everyone then. So right then i get an email from her roommate From: Sarah Wagler To: Andrew Gazaneo Subject: Hey Drew. Sarah said she told you the news. Don't tell her I told you this, but I"m glad she's leaving. Just between us, things have not been working out in the room. She just drives me crazy, i know she feels the same way about me. One week til freedom!! see you. From: Andrew Gazaneo To: Sarah Wagler Subject: RE: Holy cow Sarah, that's kind of harsh Andrew From: Sarah Wagler To: Andrew Gazaneo Subject: RE: Andrew, you don't even know what it's like. Knowing that she's going just takes a weight off my shoulders. Ah, this day is just getting better and better. From: Andrew Gazaneo To: Sarah Wagler Subject: RE: OMG Sarah. I think it's really sad that she's leaving. I guess living arrangements and stuff can be hard sometimes, but Sarah's a great friend. I think you'll miss her once she's gone. Andrew From: Sarah Wagler To: Andrew Gazaneo Subject: RE: I doubt it. I think everyone feels the same way. From: Andrew Gazaneo To: Sarah Wagler Subject: RE: Holy cow, what is going on? Are you drunk or something? Woman, think about what you're saying!!! Sarah's awesome. Just because you're on crack doesn't mean everyone's glad she's leaving. Man Sarah, I think that's pretty rude. What's is going on with you? Andrew At this point I was freaking out so I ran over to their office. As i walked in, Sarah (Dailey) had her back to me and was just telling someone "yeah, and I can't believe he's falling for all of this..." Then she turned around and started howling. ok, so it's Sarah 1, Andrew 0... we are not amused.
I'd like pews that are more like the theater seats...you know, where you can raise or lower the armrests and even recline a little. I'd really like that. I want to feel appreciated. Maybe a statue in my honor...or just a simple plaque on the wall. I think a personalized parking place may be a little much, but it would help me to feel appreciated. Again, I'd still like to see more sexy people in churches. Like, is there a supermodel church or something? That would really be my kind of thing. Actually, it could just be sexy women. I don't really want my wife (who is a sexy woman) looking at sexy men...especially during church. Fewer anouncements. I mean, did Jesus make anouncements? I don't think that's WWJD material. Heck, let's just go with no anouncements. That's probably a more Scriptural approach. Some type of free work-out facility. Gyms these days cost too much money. That's my excuse. I'm certain that if I had a church that had a free work-out facility I would actually do it and be a healthier person. That would also help me to fit in with the other sexy church goers. I want a pastor who understands me. That would probably lead to him appreciating me more (see above desire). And that way when he's preaching he could look at me and we could exchange those knowing glances...maybe even wink at each other. YOu know, like we've got some kind of inside joke. Some type of chocolate covered almond candy...I really like chocolate and almonds. Also... fewer people that I don't like. People I don't like bug me. Donuts - The good kind. With the frosting put on just right. To much glaze makes me sick and distracts me from worshipping properly. Bagels might be a better alternative to the sexy church... but if there is a free work out room I can always spend a few more minutes on the stairmaster. Excitement - I think there should be hand clapping, people who don't like hand clapping need to lighten up. Hand clapping may be the sole reason God gave us hands. That and the Michealangelo painting on the ceiling of that one place over in that foreign place. Yes enthusiasm is important. as long as noone gets to happy.

this is funny: Left Behind left behind: Rapture occurs, sales of popular series plummets Authors and publishers hurt by lost revenue, agonies of tribulation The global disappearance of Christians earlier this week attributed to the "rapture" predicted by premillennial theologians, and the corresponding disappearance of Left Behind books from bestseller lists have left authors Tim LaHaye, Jerry B. Jenkins, and their publishers discouraged and soul-searching. They're also disappointed that they were not among the airplane pilots, school bus drivers, or toll booth operators taken up to heaven in the wink of an eye, leaving behind piles of empty clothing as well as chaos, terror, and inconvenience, respectively. When asked why the rapture hurt sales of a series that would seem more timely than ever, Jenkins commented, "Apparently the folks who've actually been left behind aren't interested in reading about it. And I can see why - it's a real kick in the teeth for me personally. This goes way beyond bitter irony." Related headlines: BUSH RAPTURED!

Reading Andy Mullins' urlLink Blog and he says some good stuff about ChurchÂ© The corporate church is about reputation not righteousness. Its not about repentance and vulnerability. This world is so jacked, why do we really care whether someone else thinks we have it all together. The church must embrace our broken, wicked hearts and allow us to struggle. Who is unfit for ministry the man who confesses his sins or the man who feigns that he has no sin. Today the church would rather have a liar than a struggling growing believer. I think one of the most difficult things to do help people to deal with their sin. Being a cell leader gives me this ongoing privilege... but it does take a lot of grace and a lot of brokenness on my part. Sometimes it almost feels like the blind leading the blind... but I have to believe God has put me in these people's lives for a reason. I can be in process and lead them forward. urlLink i think .

Darkness is an unlit wick A simple spark would vanquish it Truly I could burst to flame Every time you call my name Do I do for you the same? In our ever-present need of Thee Grant we fathom peace Fashion instruments of souls set free For don't the caged ones weep? God is like a honeybee Penetrates the soul of me Truly draws the sweetness in Nectar of the meek ones is He in me and I in Him In our ever-present need of Thee Grant we fathom peace Fashion instruments of souls set free For don't the caged ones weep? Sometimes sober, sometimes bliss Every union knows of this I have stood here in His rain Bear the marks of fertile plains Swelling streams swollen grain In our ever-present need of Thee Grant we fathom peace Fashion instruments of souls set free For don't the caged ones weep?

Sonnet 17 by Pablo Neruda Aw, you're a romantic. You believe in true love and all that sort of stuff. How cute are you? To you, love is incredible and amazing. urlLink urlLink Which poem are you?

I love you as the plant that never blooms but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers; thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance, risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body. I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride; so I love you because I know no other way than this: where I does not exist, nor you, so close that your hand on my chest is my hand, so close that your eyes close as I fall asleep.

God's really been hanging out with me lately. I know that sounds vague, but it's my reality. We've been just laying in bed together, he's sat beside me in the car while i'm driving, stood beside me as I installed new lighting fixtures in our family room... It's good; I think he's getting my heart used to his everyday presence. His peace and love and kindness with me every moment. Linda Cho said to me today, "I realized that so much of my identity was wrapped up in other people's love for me, and I can't live like that, because then my foundation is built on the sand! I realized I needed to be grounded in God, the solid rock." I think I'm really getting my identity from Him right now. I read urlLink this on urlLink liquidthinking.org and it made a lot of sense. I sort of had a vision/imagination last night where I pictured Jesus and me sitting on the deck in my backyard. It was in the cool of an early morning. Both of us were drinking coffee and staring off into a hazy nothing. No words were spoken. We just sat there. After a while we looked at each other for a second like we were going to say something, but then we laughed like two friends who share some kind of inside jokes or too many close calls, and we didn't need to say anything to bring the memories of them flooding back. Then we continued drinking our coffee and staring off into the haze with little smiles on our faces.

urlLink this is possibly the worst...
do you ever have one those moments where you feel like you're really, really alive? I read the following quote today on urlLink OneHouse and thought about those moments... and how they seem to be right there when I need them. The settled happiness and security which we all desire, God withholds from us by the very nature of the world: but joy, pleasure, and merriment, He has scattered broadcast. We are never safe, but we have plenty of fun, and some ecstasy. It is not our hard to see why. The security we crave would teach us to rest our hearts in this world and oppose an obstacle to our return to God: a few moments of happy love, a landscape, a symphony, a merry meeting with our friends, a bathe or a football match, have no such tendency. Our Father refreshes us on the journey with some pleasant inns, but will not encourage us to mistake them for home. (C.S. Lewis - urlLink The Problem of Pain )
good reminder from urlLink Nickling "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD , "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.

I mean it. All I had to pay was the taxes (is that awesome or what???) Just finished booking our flights back to London and we had to a bit more but I'm ok with that. Man, i can't wait to be there. Can't wait to see the people, eat the cheese, and see the city. (Oh, and drink the beer...)
So the price of petrol is becoming criminal. Thank God I filled up yesterday at 82.5 cents a litre ... can't believe that price is actually a deal. Anyway, lots of people are freaking out. I really like what urlLink Leighton Tebay says urlLink here : The price of gas has risen to all time highs. Our government is benefiting because they collect more GST at the pump. Our 3 main political parties each have different solutions. Conservatives: Charge GST on only the first 85 cents a litre. The solution to everything is to lower taxes. Liberals: Put extra revenue from gas taxes in to medical equipment: Buy stuff we can't afford to pay anyone to operate. NDP: Regulate the price of gas. Because we know the big oil companies are screwing us over all the time. It doesn't matter that one Canadian province already does this and it makes no difference to the price of gas. HEY, HERE IS A THOUGHT! Take the money from gas taxes and invest it in to alternative fuel research and clean air technology. It is GOOD that we are paying through the nose because we have to stop using fossil fuels. The longer we wait the deeper the economic impact will be when we finally run out. Easing the pain now will just make it more difficult tomorrow. or else we could just take the urlLink TTC more.
I hung out with an old friend (well, she's not old, but our friendship is ...) today and we had an awesome afternoon. It's funny when you hang out with people who know your past. I mean, Susan's seen me as a bratty pre-teen through to the strapping hunk of man flesh I (think I) am today. The thing that was most cool was that she sees all the good that has come through over the years. It's encouraging. All things do work together for good, right?
well at least for my Blog. It's a new site design (well, not new , I basically ripped off one of the premade templates and changed a few things...) Think I still need to make a few changes thoughts?
Truth , noun 1. true quality: correspondence to fact or reality 2. something factual: something that corresponds to fact or reality - spoke the truth 3. true statement: a statement that corresponds to fact or reality 4. obvious fact: something that is so clearly true that it hardly needs to be stated 5. something generally believed: a statement that is generally believed to be true - a religious truth 6. honesty: honesty, sincerity, or integrity 7. descriptive accuracy: accuracy in description or portrayal a criticism that had an element of truth in it 8. conformity: adherence to a standard or law 9. loyalty: faithfulness to a person or a cause 10.

Stumbled across one of my most favourite poems today. It's by Denise Levertov and it's about the poet Caedmon. Basically Caedmon's story is told in Bede’s Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum (find the original version urlLink here .) So Caedmon lived as a labourer at the monastery of Whitby, founded in 657. Unfortunately, Caedmon was pretty much mute. One night, the servants of the monastery were gathered about the table for good-fellowship and the harp was passed from hand to hand (as was often done.) Caedmon, knowing nothing of poetry and unable to sing, left the company in shame. He went back to the stable with the cattle. As he slept, there stood by him in a vision a person who called him by name, and asked him to sing. "I cannot sing, and therefore I left the feast." "Sing to me, however, sing of Creation." So Caedmon began to sing in praise of God verses that he’d never heard before. This is so significant because this is recognized as the beginning of English sacred poetry. He was the first English Christian Poet. This is his poem (in modern English): Now let me praise the keeper of Heaven's kingdom, the might of the Creator, and his thought, the work of the Father of glory, how each of wonders the Eternal Lord established in the beginning. He first created for the sons of men Heaven as a roof, the holy Creator, then Middle-earth the keeper of mankind, the Eternal Lord, afterwards made, the earth for men, the Almighty Lord. Now this is Denise Levertov's brilliant poem from Caedmon's perspective: All others talked as if talk were a dance. Clodhopper I, with clumsy feet would break the gliding ring. Early I learned to hunch myself close by the door: then when the talk began I'd wipe my mouth and wend unnoticed back to the barn to be with the warm beasts, dumb among body sounds of the simple ones. I'd see by a twist of lit rush the motes of gold moving from shadow to shadow slow in the wake of deep untroubled sighs. The cows munched or stirred or were still. I was at home and lonely, both in good measure. Until the sudden angel affrighted me--light effacing my feeble beam, a forest of torches, feathers of flame, sparks upflying: but the cows as before were calm, and nothing was burning, nothing but I, as that hand of fire touched my lips and scorched my tongue and pulled my voice into the ring of the dance. Isn't it awesome? Portions from urlLink Ian Lancashire a brilliant professor at urlLink U of T .
I’ve been working on a new blog template for a few weeks now (probably because everyone else is too... I know, I know) but in some ways it’s difficult. I’ve really enjoyed my site so far and the orange has been representational (no it hasn’t…) but it’s been… familiar. So I think I’ll make the change this week (if we’re all lucky). Sniff, sniff.
urlLink There's me at Fresh Wind speaking on purity to about 3000 youth and young adults... my Mom would be so proud. Overall the event was a bit overwhelming but amazing. I felt a huge boldness and freedom that I haven't felt before. I guess all that stuff about stepping out in urlLink boldness works. God really met me. And man do I need a haircut.
This is amazing! WITH every rib in his little body broken and his lungs on the verge of collapsing, seven-year-old Tyler Moon trudged through 2km of bushland to save his father's life. Tyler and dad David, 40, had been zooming around on the family's quad bike in bushland next to their property near Milton, on the New South Wales south coast. But in a freak accident on Saturday morning, the bike hit a large wedge of wood and jolted suddenly, throwing the pair over the handlebars. The bike landed on top of David, with the motor still running. Read the whole article urlLink here .

So i was watching (to my urlLink chagrin ) the urlLink Dateline NBC special last night on " urlLink Friends ." I was forced because my sister and mom desperately wanted to watch it. Anyway, at one point they read the original pitch for the show (written over a decade ago) and something stuck out at me. One of the hosts said, It’s about being at a point in our lives where anything and everything is possible. Looking for intimacy, and love, and relationship yet being afraid of intimacy, and love, and relationship. All I could think was, that's exactly the experience of being a Young Adult. Interesting, eh?
man, it sucks being under the weather. I had an amazing weekend getting tons of leadership teaching (read: stretching), I called two guys into my G12, and now everything aches...

Years ago I sat in a worship service listening to a retarded girl in her twenties sing a song she had written. She started slowly, awkwardly, the room felt uncomfortable. As she sang the words were difficult to understand her pitch and timing were absolutely terrible. Strangely something about her song brought me to worship. The next woman to sing had an amazing opera voice. I'm sure it was a beautiful song but it was anything but contemporary. I suppose I felt it was unworthy for true worship. The next girl to sing was the pastor's daughter. Like the second woman, she too had a beautiful voice, I had never met her but she seem very snooty, she sang a contemporary worship song, one that I liked, but I sat annoyed by her singing. Looking back over the years I've thought about that situation many times. Was it anointing? My attitude? Their attitudes? I had grace for the retarded girl and not for the other ladies. My lack of grace cause me to miss out on worship an activity that helps me or were they just performances I didn't like, simple as that. Regardless, I think a lot of pressure has been put on music ministers to perform and deliver excellence. I don't think Jesus is critical of a persons singing voice, or style of music. I do believe he looks at the heart. Maybe we need better ways of teaching excellence in the heart. from urlLink Liquidthinking
urlLink I want urlLink One . I've always had this ongoing fascination with urlLink Macs ... but the new urlLink Powerbooks are so powerful and sleek.

I know, i know, like I need another reason to love Costco... Indeed, Costco's pay is much, much, much better -- a full-time Costco clerk or warehouse worker earns more than $41,000 a year, plus getting terrific health-care coverage. Wal-Mart workers get barely a third of that pay, plus a lousy health-care plan. Costco even has unions! Yet, Costco's labor costs are only about half of Wal-Mart's. How's that possible? One reason is that Costco workers feel valued, which adds enormously to their productivity, and they don't leave -- employee turnover is a tiny fraction of Wal-Mart's rapidly revolving door.

In my urlLink iTunes here at home i've got a few songs on repeat tonight. 1. Everything's Alright - Charlie Hall (this song is great except it's almost impossible to find a recording of it. Kind of has a Toad the Wet Sprocket sound...) 2. Enigma Variations - Edward Elgar (very regal sound and yet really emotive as well. and so beautiful.) 3. Above all Else - Wendy O'Connell (Vineyard UK) (the chorus lyrics are "Above all else, above all else, above all else, give me yourself." I think that says it all.) 4. Here I am - Emmylou Harris. (I know I've urlLink already written about this song but it's so relevant and i need to hear God pursuing me right now in this season of my life.) Lyrics : I am standing by the river I will be standing here forever Tho you're on the other side My face you still can see Why won't you look at me Here l am I am searching thru the canyon It is your name that I am calling Tho you're so far away I know you hear my plea Why won't you answer me Here I am I am in the blood of your heart The breath of your lung Why do you run for cover You are from the dirt of the earth And the kiss of my mouth I have always been your lover Here I am I am the promise never broken And my arms are ever open In this harbor calm and still I will wait until Until you come to me Here I am
read a urlLink passage today from Henri Nouwen's urlLink The Genesee Diary and it reminded me of John Elderedge's urlLink Waking the Dead . He talks about the fact that I am the Glory of God... walking around here on the Earth everyday. Obviously, all this is more than an insight, an idea, a way of seeing things. That is why it is a subject of mediation and not so much for study. But once you start "realizing" in this very intimate and personal way that you are indeed are the glory of God, then everything is different, then your life takes a decisive turn. Then, for instance, your passions which seemed so real, more real than God, show their illusory nature to you and sort of dwindle away.
MY LORD GOD, I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think that I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you. And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing. I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road though I may know nothing about it. Therefore will I trust you always though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death. I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me to face my perils alone. Thomas Merton From urlLink the Ooze Blog .
well, i'm getting back to life again. Things have been up and down but God's really spoken to me a lot. I guess urlLink Comet's death was harder for me than i thought. It's funny how God uses these times that we're vulnerable to really do deep stuff. Just as I've been unsure about my heart and asking him about my future... I've gotten about 10 prophetic words from people telling me exactly what I've been asking God for. They all keep saying things like "God wants you to step out," "Step into prophetic worship," "Dig into intimacy." I have really been wanting a greater depth in my God-relationship... urlLink Don Potter really challenged me last Friday night about living in that most Holy and intimate place. When my buddy Bill and I went out to dinner with him, everything he kept saying was something like "I've just dug right into God... I don't live for other people at all anymore... it's just Him." I waited patiently for the LORD to help me, and he turned to me and heard my cry. 2 He lifted me out of the pit of despair, out of the mud and the mire. He set my feet on solid ground and steadied me as I walked along. 3 He has given me a new song to sing, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see what he has done and be astounded. They will put their trust in the LORD. 4 Oh, the joys of those who trust the LORD, who have no confidence in the proud, or in those who worship idols. 5 O LORD my God, you have done many miracles for us. Your plans for us are too numerous to list. If I tried to recite all your wonderful deeds, I would never come to the end of them... urlLink Psalms 40 .

The familiar figure of Nelson Mandela, with his trade-mark floral shirt and ready smile, will be fading from the international limelight. The father of South Africa's democracy and icon of many across the globe has announced his intention to retreat from public life. Speaking at a gathering of media and friends on June 1 in Johannesburg, Mandela said: "I'm turning 86 in a few weeks' time [July 18], and that is a longer life than most people are granted. "I have the added blessing of being in very good health, at least according to my doctors. I'm confident that nobody present here today will accuse me of selfishness if I ask to spend time, while I'm still in good heath, with my family, my friends, and also with myself." He said he did not intend to hide away totally, but he missed the opportunity for reading, thinking, and quiet reflection and would now do these things and work on his memoirs. the urlLink whole story
I never met a man with a fence around his property that felt safer for it. Winston Churchill, misquoted by urlLink Keri Smith
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor. You can safely assume that you've created God in your own image when it turns out that God hates all the same people you do. Anne Lamott

my puppy is dying. Well, he's not a puppy any more. Comet's 14 years old now and he's lived a healthy life; over the past six months, his health has rapidly declined. It's been really hard. I hate having to let him go, but I don't want him to suffer for another 6 months. I don't want my last memories of my dog to be terrible. Just this past weekend, there's been a lot of bleeding and we feel that it's time. I'm really sad. It looks like i'll be the one to take him into the vet tonight; then my grandfather has volunteered to bury Comet in some private land. In all of this, God has spoken a lot to me. I have peace with letting him go; there is a time for everything: to be born and to die. I'm still processing... please pray if you can. He's been a part of the family for 14 years... and he'll be missed. urlLink urlLink urlLink urlLink
Our church service today was meaningful, and moving. I don't want that to get lost in this story. Our community of believers held each other tight, and shared our struggles. The beginning of our service in particular was very hard. Our friend, Barbara, is dying. Gordon announced that Barbara is now hospitalized. The sudden and rapid decline of her health has been very difficult on our entire congregation. It's been especially rough for Amy who feels that, due to her own health problems, she has not had an opportunity to be there for Barbara. Today we prayed for peace for Barbara and for God to somehow grant us the ability to accept His apparent will. Amy wept. I asked for prayers of strength and healing for Amy and our good friend Cynthia held Amy close. I shut my eyes holding back tears. Gordon prayed aloud and walked over to where Amy and I sat to lay his hands upon us. Unfortunately my giant mug of sweet tea was in the aisle at my feet and when Gordon came to us, his foot hit the mug and a measure of tea reminiscent of the Exxon Valdez oil spill gurgled out onto the floor of the sanctuary. It was no big deal, most of the church members didn't notice, and those who did didn't care. Our small community of faith is quite used to messy church...personally I think that's how church is supposed to be. To his credit, Gordon didn't miss a beat. He kept reaching toward Amy and prepared to deliver more deep and heartfelt words of prayer. However, he did take one brief moment to give me a quick glance and jokingly whisper, "Don't blog about this." It made me smile and despite her tears I saw a slight smirk from Amy. Honestly, I'm not sure I could have asked for a more immediate answer to prayer. for the rest of this really good story go urlLink here .
I wait quietly before God, for my salvation comes from him. He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress where I will never be shaken. So many enemies against one man – all of them trying to kill me. To them I'm just a broken-down wall or a tottering fence. They plan to topple me from my high position. They delight in telling lies about me. They are friendly to my face, but they curse me in their hearts. Interlude I wait quietly before God, for my hope is in him. He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress where I will not be shaken. My salvation and my honor come from God alone. He is my refuge, a rock where no enemy can reach me. O my people, trust in him at all times. Pour out your heart to him, for God is our refuge. Interlude From the greatest to the lowliest – all are nothing in his sight. If you weigh them on the scales, they are lighter than a puff of air. Don't try to get rich by extortion or robbery. And if your wealth increases, don't make it the center of your life. God has spoken plainly, and I have heard it many times: Power, O God, belongs to you; unfailing love, O Lord, is yours. Surely you judge all people according to what they have done. urlLink Psalm 62 (NLT)

It was awesome because they preached and not me!! The both felt God pressing them to speak on the Father heart of God and it was incredible.

I think exersise is horribly undignified. Jews don't exercise, It uses up blood better left in the brain. My grandfather is a rare exception, he's a Jew who became rich from the exercise of gay men (for the most part.) He recently sold his magazine company, which had begun to flag, and is slightly out of sorts. No wonder, he had started his bushiness from scatch and devoted his life to it, and now it's in the paws of some slimy yuppie. I used to be fat until two years ago when I went to THE WORST FUCKING BOARDING SCHOOL ON EARTH. Bye bye trust fund. Up in lake placid, it was -30*F in the daytime for two solid weeks. We spent a fortune in long underwear. The food was so shitty and it was so hard to stay warm the pounds melted. I became so thin (99 lbs. From 120) They declared me anorexic and kept "an eye" out on me, which meant I could not eat salad. Really. I don't have strong self-destructive tendencies (like my then-pal, 13 year old R, who said she fucked men anytime she wanted to at home). The strangest thing I do is that sometimes I'll go outside (or in the house when I'm alone) and breath as fast and as deeply as I can unlil I almost or hypervenilate. I like the tingily sort of feel it gives me, and I'm sure it's harmless. The art department sucked horribly as well. We had one, sporadic drawing class taught by this mannish woman who knew no one (except ME, dammit) had any interest in developing work, so she gave us beginner exercises out of a textbook. One of the kids could only draw stick figures, and he was so utter daunted one class he put his head on the table and cried. I nearly felt sorry for him, but he was such a little piss-pot I snickered with the rest of the class. It was a rare moment of solidarity among my classmates.
I haven't mentioned it, but I've spent the last two weeks up in provincetown with my mother, sibs and grandmother. My sister is nine, my brother seven, and they each have their problems but we've gotten along much better since I decided to ignore them most of the time. My mom doesn't know about this blog, I don't want her to. I don't think I care or even want anyone to read this blog. If someone did, I'd love for them to send me an e-mail. All my friends are fucking crazy and have almost no access to a computer. My best friend has begun a bike trip across California, to eventually end up in Mexico, where she knows no-one. It's 9:40 as I write this, and our fragment of hurricane Charlie has still to run it's course. I read a charming article in the utne reader called either "how blogs ruined my life" or "how my life is ruined by blogging," but it was very funny, and although I believe pre-2000 utne is superior to current issues, It's worth reading and you can subscribe to utne through their website. I've begun to read The Extra Man, about a gentelmanly tranvestite in new york who rooms with an eccentric elderly escort.
There was nothing she detested so much in the climates and seasons as a fine summer afternoon, with its lazy languor, with the obscene, satiated luxuriance of its vegetation which seems to communicate itself both to animals and people. The dreadful act initiated by those muggy, voluptuous hours was that of lounging in a chaise longue with one's legs apart and one's arms raised, while yawning very loudly, as if obliged to expose one's genitals, armpits, and mouth to goodness knew what kind of rape. Against this triple yawn, Melanie cultivated the laugh and the sob, two reactions which implied refusal, distance, and the human being's withdrawal into itself. The weather best suited to this rejection syndrome was a luminous frost, which gave rise to a denuded, frozen, hardened, and brilliant character... Like all children, she had encountered the mystery of death. But in her eyes it had immediately taken on two completely opposite aspects. The animal corpses she had seen were usually swollen and decomposed, and exuded sanious secretions. Such beings, reduced to their last extremities, crudely avowed their basically putrid nature. Whereas dead insects became lighter, spiritual, and spontaneously attained the pure, delicate eternity of mummies. And this did not only apply to insects for, ferreting around in the attic, Melanie had found a mouse and a little bird that were equally desiccated, purified, reduced to their own distinctive essence. This was a good death. -From Michel Tournier's The Fetishist, "Death and the Maiden," lifted from "slurping sounds." (I'm not clear on the mechanics of posting from an excerpt of another's post, but since I didn't actually use her words, I'm pretty sure I won't have to ask her permission.)

The birth of my blog! Can you smell the silicone? This blog will suckle gladly at the breast of the summer of my fifteenth year. Sigh. I suppose you middle-aged readers with you had your youthful exuberance and health to spend hours on a pathetic open journal. But this is the Hollywood of the diary! Who knows what young starlet will be discovered? Perhaps a talent agent, after hours spent shuffling through the millions of dull blogs that pollute the internet, to happen upon (not this one, I only post to spread the love)one sassy, sprite of as blog that has him on the very edge of his swivel seat. He must know who is the possessor on such a swift, witty tongue! You are discovered, and it's only a matter of time until you've got a sitcom and a book deal in the oven. Life is sweet!
urlLink Friendship is the Mysterious Bond in Human Life urlLink
An old hurt lay burried between me and a friend of mine, watered with silence, fertilized by time. It grew strong, as much hurts do, when left neglected by forgiveness. I used to watch it grow between us. We are the one that planted it but I did continualy sought a way to uproot the ugly old thing. However pity me for not finding the only balm that can heal our hurts. A time did come when I finally get it, in the midst of our hurts , I stop dead in my tracks and somewhere the voice in myhead cried out ENOUGH! ENOUGH fighting and crying or struggling to hold on to this friendship bond that I once treasured and gamble my trust on. Now, there's no more silence between us, there's fake laughter fooling all the audience that we are still good friends. Mimicking the character of what friends always seems to be like. But still deep inside us, I think we're torn apart, deep in our hearts, the silence is still there. Our heart never spoken anymore the language that we once familiar with. The wall between us both is too thick that can never be torn easily. But still my friend I do care about you, trust me I still do. Please take a good care of your own self because you are precious to many of us. May Allay bless us and live to the fullest as I will always pray for our happiness though in the silence between us.
urlLink The story that change my POV about life urlLink
This book touches a lot of people in ways they wouldnt think possible.I think everybody should read it. It can positively alter the way you think about life. Mitch Albom had always promised to keep in touch with his favorite college professor, Morris Schwartz, after college was over. Of course, he didn't. Some years later, he saw Morrie on TV, where Mitch found out that his favorite teacher had contracted the painful disease ALS. His body, was slowly withering away but not his spirit. Mitch gets in contact with Morrie and they start meeting on Tuesdays to talk about life, death and happiness. Mitch tries to gain Morries insight on numerous scope, not only for himself, but for his entire generation of thirty something. Morrie has a great attitude about life, and also death. He doesn't strive to gain posessions that he doesn't need. Instead, he focuses on people he loves and the relationships he has. Morries goal with Mitch was always to loosen him up, to make him cry before his life was over. He succeeds not only to get Mitch to cry by the end of the book. This is quite possibly one of the best books I've ever read. It is full of great mantras that I will always remember. My suggestion, keep kleenex handy, even if you are a tough guy.
Fortunately, I get many chances throughout my day to stop and praise God for the creation that is a four year old son. Sometimes, I'm sure to God it sounds a little more like a complaint than gratitude, but really, I can't thank God enough for the blessing of my son. Your kids keep you humble, that's true enough. For me, when I can tell that my son's imagination is conjuring up a whole world I can't see, I am for a split second returned to my own childhood, where I too can believe that a shark lives in the hot tub... Tyler often has a "fetish of the week" that leaves me scratching my head and wondering if I'm not monitoring his TV intake as well as I thought. This past week, he HAD to have flippers. Why? Well, of course, because there is a shark in the hot tub and the next time we get in he has to be able to kill it. We humor him, thinking a "Jaque Cousteau" future isn't necessarily a bad thing. Better than his incessant questioning about rubber gloves and cleaning toilets a few weeks earlier. So, Father of The Year hooked the kid up with not only flippers, but a snorkel set, too. We were waiting for the hot tub to warm up to an acceptable winter tempature (which for me is like 104, but everybody else seems to favor 102 or 101) and I was attending to the normal house chaos. I knew Tyler had found a Playdough set he had gotten for Christmas. He's pretty good when it comes to the Playdough Rules: #1 Don't eat it, #2 Keep it on the Table, #3 Don't leave it out because it'll get hard and you'll cry and beg me to buy more. Well, he was pretty proud that he had made a red giraffe, showed it to me briefly, and then moved on to the next source of entertainment. In my faulty logic, I thought my husband had an eye on him. Soon he emerged from his room in his swimming trunks and ready to go shark-hunting. I asked him to put the playdough away first. So he brings me the little plastic jar with a hunk of playdough the size of a pebble in it. "Where is the rest of the playdough?", I ask him. "I don't know," he says. "Well, find it. You can't get in the hot tub until you find it." Ten minutes later, he's standing at my side whining. "Mommy, I looked EVERYWHERE and I can't find it." "Look again, Tyler. You don't just LOSE Playdough. What where you doing with it? Is it in your room? It better not be in your room!" You can see where this is going. No help from the husband to search for the missing playdough. As of right now, it is still MIA. In fact I am convinced that once I get the time and the nerve to clean Tyler's room, I'll find it smooshed into the carpet as an everlasting homage to red giraffes. And when that moment comes, I'll smile and think of how my four-year-old killed a shark that night for us, just so we could enjoy an hour in the hot tub.
It was one of those nights that I was just bored to tears looking for something to do. Oh, who am I kidding? I'm never bored! But I could have been doing three loads of laundry or (oh!) filing my taxes or scrubbing around my toilets with a toothbrush... but instead I chose to bake a cookie. You see, there were semi-sweet chocolate morsels in an unopened bag leftover from uninhabited Christmas baking. They called to me.... and being a faithful Atkins dieter, I decided I'd better do something with them and get them out of my sight before I open the bag and next thing you know - they're gone! But, like any good mom I delegate my time very carefully and of course the sensible thing to do was bake one big cookie instead of wasting hours cooking several batches. So as I started our Poor-boy Taco Salad dinner (Thank God my husband is TOTALLY picky and his favorite meal is tortilla chips, taco meat and cheese - even I can handle that!) I began mixing the cookies. Then the almost-1 kid started screaming. Then the sister-in-law came over to use the internet to do her taxes. And it just occurred to me that the four year old didn't even eat dinner. And here's how Mom-of-the-year multitasks.... Put the baby in her high chair with cut up bananas and Cheeze-its for dinner. Go back to the bedroom and pull up the internet. The connection is not there. Turn the computer off and unplug the modem. Tell sister-in-law to turn the computer back on when the little light flickers green. Take the ground beef out of the microwave and throw it in a skillet. Add baking soda to the flour in the glass bowl. Look for brown sugar, find that it is hard as granite. Remember someone told you to put it in the oven to soften it up. So you do that. Go back to computer room. Still no connection. Stand on desk, disconnect router and modem. Turn everything off. Go add water and taco seasoning to meat. Check on cooking brown sugar. Add eggs. Yell at four year old. Why? Don't remember. Go back to computer room. Turn everything back on. Yell at husband that dinner is done. Take brown sugar out of oven and chop it up with a knife. Eyeball that it's enough to make 3/4 a cup and throw it in the bowl. Fix a plate of ghetto-taco-salad, take a bite. Go to the computer room, and help sis-in-law find the right site. Finish mixing the cookie dough, place it on baking stone. Which I should mention is the smaller version. Yell at husband to release the angry beast from her high chair. Dough looks like it might melt a little and run off the stone, but not much thought is given to that. Yell at husband to occupy kids so I can help sis-in-law with taxes. Sis-in-law is somewhat technologically challenged, has to go though the world's easiest tax file I've ever seen like 3 times. No problem, a click here, an adjusted gross income there, we're in business. Husband is yelling at four year old for almost slamming his sisters finger in the door. Finish cold ghetto taco salad. Start bath water for four-year-old. Smell something weird. Check on cookie, sure enough, it is dripping off the baking stone and is turning to Blackened Chocolate Chip cookie on the bottom of the oven. Open door and windows to let out smoke even though it's like 30 degrees outside. Finish up on computer with sis-in-law. Churn in envy that she'll see a refund. Yell at four year old to get in tub. The cookie, amazingly still mostly in tact and looking deliciously edible, is finally pulled out of the oven. As I go through the much similar chaos of putting the children to bed, I marvel at the beauty that is my cookie, even though we lost some of it to The Dark Depths Below. It still looked perfect, and even though the smell from the oven was of burnt crispiness, the cookie itself was golden brown, perfectly puffy, and dotted generously with the morsels that began it all. House in nightime order (or the closest resemblance thereof), I try my cookie. IT IS TOTALLY NOT DONE. I almost cried. The edges were done about one inch in all the way around, but it was way ooey-gooey; salmonella poisoning waiting to happen. Alas, my cookie met it's bitter end with a quick flip of the wrist into the garbage pail. A moment of silence, please. My final thoughts. It was a pretty cookie. And I am SO glad Pampered Chef stoneware is SO easy to clean. Nothing sticks to that stuff!!!!
I just started a new blog trying to support the Pastor of my urlLink church , First Baptist of Alamogordo. And I tried to make it very supportive and not too totally offensive. But since this is my official ramblings page, let me just say now how TOTALLY pissed off I am!! There are people in my church who are so completely self righteous that they are against the growth of the church through the addition of a more contemporary service be added to the program. And why??? Because ANYTHING that this pastor tries to change meets with opposition. I know I have a few faithful friends out there that read this, and whatever your religious background, please stop right now and say a prayer for Pastor Charles Hanks of FBC Alamogordo. In continued rambling, let me get to the nitty gritty. The SENIOR members of our church are supposed to be the backbone, the foundation, the people that tell everyone else to listen to the Pastor. Ever since Charles became our Pastor, he has been dragged through countless boughts of political and control messes. And the respect I have for the elders in our church has dwindle to nothing. The rumor is the old people boycotted the morning "traditional" service that is supposed to be the early service. And they won't come to the contemporary ones because somehow praise songs that include drums and guitar are blasphemy (Make a Joyful Noise?????)... So we basically have leaders in our church saying that they are just going to stay in Sunday school on Sunday mornings. Okay, that's the way to follow God's command to fellowship and be a part of the church body. And way to make an example for the youth - go right ahead and tell them they need to go to church, but they won't see you there!!! And money? I'm sure more than a few of the people trying to drive this thing out have the notion that since they tithe, they should have control. Yeah, that's what God said about tithing - give your 10% and then you can put down your pastor, oppose the growth of your own church and make sure not to "go ye therefore" and bring the Word to all the nations - because no one in their right mind will want to join a church, much less become a Christian after looking at your example. I have never felt more pity for whoever it is that started this, and their inability and unwillingness to change. I can't believe these people profess to be Christians, and I am ashamed for all Christians because these are the very kind of people that turn off new believers and people who are seeking the truth and have not yet found it. Fortunately, I learned a while ago that people let you down, not God, and that every church has a few of those people that cause division. I PRAY, I PRAY, I PRAY - that God will convict these people and YES, they are entitled to their opinion but, NO - THEY ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ADVOCATE THE DYING OF A CHURCH THAT HAS JUST BEGUN TO GROW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Those that oppose these changes are doing just that.... why can't they see that?????? UUUGHHGHGHGHG!!!!!!!!
Here's the conversation I had with my 4-year-old yesterday: "Mommy, change my name." "What's wrong with your name?" "I don't like Tyler." "What would you like to be called?", as I look over at my husband with a silent plea for help with this one. "Anthony." "Well, Anthony is your middle name, but there's nothing wrong with Tyler." "I want to be called Anthony Johnson." A moment of silence from mom. "You can't just change your last name, too. Well, girls change their last names but only after they get married because they take their husband's name, and some don't even do that ." "I want to be called Johnson because I am related to Magic Johnson." ( A. We're white. B. I'm not 100% positive he knows who Magic Johnson really is, other than my husband has touted him as the all-time greatest NBA star ever. C. Does this qualify as gross parental failure? ) After laughing aloud and probably offending the child and scarring him for life as he was drop-dead serious about this whole name thing... "Sweetheart, you can't change your name to Johnson and be related to Magic. It doesn't work that way, and really, no one will believe you are related to him anyway." We could see the whells in his head just a-spinnin', then he says, "Okay, I guess Anthony will be okay then." What, pray tell, do I have to look forward to if the kid is already wanting to change his name??? Should I hire a psychologist now, or should we wait until he paints his room black and starts collecting vintage AC/DC t-shirts a camoflouge pants???
I've been traumatized. And I want to sue Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes and DEFINITELY John Leguizamo for wasting 2 hours of my life last night and leaving a psychological dent in me that even Dr. Phil won't be able to bang out. "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar" came on last night on USA. I hadn't seen it before and was freakishly curious about what the rave could possibly be to warrant the syndicating of Patrick Swayze as a drag queen. It was not that great a movie, a very typical "beauty inside" theme, but really... My Patrick-I-Loved-you-in-Dirty-Dancing crush ended with this movie. I was wondering, were these guys thinking, "You know, these jock-roadhouse-passenger 57 movies are doing nothing for our careers. Why don't we all dress in drag and invade a small town???" What the hell? Not that I have anything against drag queens, but how aweful is it that Patrick is definite eye-candy as Johnny-the-bad-boy, but he passes as a fairly decent looking woman, too? I am so disturbed. I didn't sleep good. I will have to take my two copies of "Dirty Dancing" and the accompanying soundtrsck CD's to Goodwill now. It's like looking at crime scene photos - you know a gruesome image will be burned into your mind and that you really wish you didn't possess dark human curiosity, but you look all the same and then sometimes, when you shut your eyes, you see Patrick Swayze in a dress with red hair and boobs and you pray that God strikes that image from your memory.
An old friend recently sent me an email that characterized women as we are - multifaceted, strong and wonderful, with our only flaw being that we often forget how wonderful and strong and multifaceted we are. I think it is so true. Thinking back to recent conversations with friends this week, I have to tell you that we women settle for a lot less than we deserve. One of these friends (let's call her... Tommy Girl) had a break-up/get back together. The problem the way I see it (she may not agree) is that she hasn't yet had that "A-ha!" moment in her female life. She has no idea how truly beautiful and intricate she is beyond the image she sees in the mirror each day. I've relayed what I've learned in my eight-years and counting relationship with my husband, and not to sound sexist, but men never think through things the way women do. Never. Ever. Her me loud and clear ladies, the man in your life is noever going to "get it". I told Tommy Girl that the "A-Ha" moment for me is the moment I succumbed to this very notion, and ceased allowing my husband's actions to get to me. (Don't get me wrong, if he's abusive mentally or physically or cheats on you, this doesn't apply.) If he loves you, the way I believe Tommy Girl's man does, then he loves you. But he doesn't define you. He doesn't make you better or worse, he just magnifies the person you make yourself. If you are a happy person, happy with yourself, that will be magnified 10 times over in your relationship with him. If you haven't quite figured yourself out yet, then being with him only makes your self-image blurrier. Not bad, just blurry. AND YOU WILL NEVER CHANGE HIM. The harder you try, the more subconciously he will resist. My advice to Tommy Girl was this: (and I hope it's not intrinsically wrong nor relationship-damning advice) If you love him, you have to come to terms with his imperfections. But first you have to come to terms with your own imperfections. I don't know, maybe I've "settled" into my marriage. Maybe that's how it looks. But I don't think so. I came to the conclusion long ago that James may not be willing to change or to even acknowledge his imperfections, but I am. And only because being the absolute best woman I can be is what God and Oprah recommend. I've even read it in the Bible, a woman's household is defined by her hard work and loving touch, she is not defined by anyone or anything else. And maybe it is that realization that has lead me to finding out what I want out of life and fitting my husband and family into that picture, instead of hopelessly looking for a place to fit in in a picture I didn't paint. We still have our fights- money, parenting skills, preoccupation with ESPN... but you know, I feel like I know us. I can see our future because I know who I am and what I want, and I know that if my husband ever ceases to value everything that I bring to the table, it will be his loss and someone else's (Ben Affleck?? Chris Cagle??) gain. And I wish Tommy Girl could see herself the way I see her - as me three or four years ago. Jealous, angry, usually confused about life in general... Tommy Girl is awesome, as is our partner in crime the RedHead, who also seems to be completely unaware of her awesome girl-power. It's not a love fest, it's not lip service to the race that sustains humanity - it's the truth. We, as women, are wonderful, powerful, multi-faceted creatures. Our every action is motivated by what is in our hearts and what is in our heads, and too often we let that motivation be negative. Tommy Girl, Redhead - I ask you this... (It's late and I may be stupid) If you invited Beau 1 and Beau 2 over for dinner, would you take the turkey out of the oven and serve it to them if it wasn't done yet just because they arrived a half hour before the estimated time of thoroughly-cookedness? (How do you like that word?) And just because they are there already, would you take out the apple pie even though it's not even close to done? No, I don't think you would... I think this should be true for women... The men that enter our lives come into them before we are "fully done", and we have a tendency to try to serve it up even though we realize it may be the salmonella poisoning of the relationship. It's fine to finish cooking the turkey while they sit and wait, but they have to sit and wait . You think they might get impatient and leave? Nah... guys will hang around for eons just waiting for the turkey to be cooked to perfection. Geez, why do you think Thanksgiving is such a man-holiday? All they care about is the friggin' turkey - not that Pilgrims and Indians first made peace so many moons ago, even though we had our fingers crossed behind our backs and took all their land and slaughtered their tribes... (whoa, way off course....) Gosh, I'm really growing to love you guys and your love interests that I have yet to meet!!! I hope you know that settling for anything less than your best self is cheating on life. (Watch Oprah instead of working all the damn time!!!!) May God bless both of you and your relationships, and when in doubt, don't listen to me - dig out your nearest Bible and read 1 Corinthians 13... "...Love never fails..." and my personal new favorite... Song of Solomon 8:6-7 "Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy unyielding as the grave. It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame. Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot wash it away. If one were to give all of the wealth of his household for love, it would be utterly scorned."
At the risk of sounding profound, I believe that there are two kinds of people. There are people that are regurgitations of the world that is around them - people that form opinions based on what the world will think of them, as if it really cares. Then there are people that are in the world, but not "of" it. They do what they do because of what they believe, and they say "To hell with what others think..." and they really mean it. I know people on both sides of the fence, and I guess to some degree we all take trips to both sides. I was watching the news early this morning, thinking that I better get a handle on this whole democratic caucus thing, just in case I ever need to have an intelligent conversation about it. And I realize that knowing a thing or two and being well informed is different from having an opinion. I know what's going on towards the November election of '04, but quite frankly, I don't have an opinion about it. I suppose I think that Bush is doing the best that he can, and being a Republican "by nature" I support his administration. Other than hearing that Dean appears to be a liar and that everyone is loving this John Edwards guy, I've not gathered enough information to "regurgitate" my opinion on the whole thing. So then I was reading my daily devotional, which I won't lie, is more like a three-times a week catch-up for me. But I realized that there is such a bigger picture than anything we see or hear about the world around us. That if I died today, knowing factual information about the Democratic caucus wouldn't at all make a difference. What would? I suppose it would make a difference to know that my unshakeable faith in God has been passed along to my children, and maybe to a few friends along the way. That whether people think I am right or wrong about God's existence, they knew I believed, and maybe from that they will have a shred of wonder and twinge of ambition to find out for themselves what the whole Jesus-freak thing is about. And that I am far from perfect, far from a perfect Christian - hence the need for a Savior in the first place. I guess I always kind of thought that God was saving us from this world, saving us from evil... but I guess I have figured out that He is saving us from ourselves. From the part of us that gets up in the morning and forgets that He is waiting for us to just say hello, or the part of us that gets mad and blames Him so effortlessly for things that have gone wrong in our lives that are so obviously of our own doing. And how often does my fear of the world's opinion of me keep me from telling people of the gift I have in knowing that I am saved? Of knowing that no matter how imperfect I am, because of His love, I am better than I was yesterday, better than I was a year ago, better than I was 5 years ago? That the whole point of being a Christian isn't to profess to be perfect and never do anything that raises an eyebrow, it's to learn from your mistakes, to do your best to turn around and walk the other way when you are running down the road of self-destruction that is often disguised with fleeting happiness. Does imperfection make Christians hippocrites? No, I don't think so. It makes them human. And no one is in the position to judge a person's relationship with God, so no one truly knows whether or not a person is saved. What does that have to do with the people on either side of that fence - (oh yeah, there may be a point in here somewhere)... I've spent the last few years talking to God and getting to know myself and I am ashamed at how much time I spend on the side of the fence that worries what the world thinks. There are those people in my life that I can look at and so easily try to judge, wondering where they are coming from and how on earth they have come to the conclusions that they hold on to. I often tell my son to do something and he says something like, "but you're not getting ready for bed..." or "but Mackenzie gets to stay up...", and I tell him that he needs to worry about himself and what I tell him to do not what he sees everyone else doing. In my profoundness this morning I can realize that God says the same thing to me all the time - that I get caught up in what others are doing and saying and forget to do the things I am supposed to be doing. I want to be on the side of the fence where I don't care what the world around me thinks. Where I can shout at the top of my lungs that everything good in my life is a blessing from God, a blessing I don't deserve, a life that is increasingly exceeding my wildest dreams.
Have you ever owned a Frigidaire? Don't buy one. Let me tell you my story. And then if Frigidaire wants to sue me, go ahead - just give me a freakin' washer that washes, dryer that doesn't twist clothes into teeny tiny clothes-balls and a refrigerator that doesn't have an out-of whack fan that rattles loud enough to wake the proud owners of a Maytag all the way down the street. I re-started Atkins on January 1 this year, and it's like going on speed for me. I guess it is a compliment to the late Dr. Atkins - I tried Atkins once before and wasn't ready for a long term commitment, what with the glory of Christmas cookies and cheesecake and apple pie right around the corner. But after my end-of-the-year overindulge, I once again took the Atkins oath. And once again it is like I am on speed. The absence of carbs seems to generate a tremendous amount of energy for me, so today it looked like a good day to wash evey bit of laundry in my house. I started out by washing another casualty of an exploded diaper (see "Adventures in Poo..."). By the way, Mackenzie's nickname is Pooper. Her dad and I believe that it is quite appropriate and indicative of her daily routine, as well as it may serve as a decent deterrent from the opposite sex later in life. Whatever works, right? So anyway, I put the little outfit in the washer. Later on, when the cycle should be well over, I check on it to find that it is in fact stuck. So I reset it. It works fine. Next, a load of jeans. And I swear, I didn't stuff it - just a nice comfortable load. Once again, I go to check and find it stuck midcycle. I call the guy that sold us all of our Frigidaire appliances, as he has gotten to know us well with our quarterly inquiries about our existing warranties. He tells me he's really sorry, and that they'll have someone out to fix it on Monday at 3. Then I realize that thing is leaking, and I start crying (yes, crying) over the stupid amount of money we have spent on all these brand new appliances that seem to be doomed. But I'm a survivor. My husband left this morning for a trip to Vegas, so he's not here to be the usual target of my wrath. It's got to go somewhere, so I decide I'm going to fix the thing myself. James calls from the road and asks me if it really matters that I can't do laundry until Monday. "No," I say, "But it's the principle." Ah, yes, the principle. I've never been a big fan of laundry and I am pretty well known for letting it pile up until forced to do it because everyone has run out of underwear. (Although this doesn't seem to bother the four-year-old.) But since I'm on speed and every room in my house will be pristine by next Friday, I REALLLLLY wanted to get the laundry done. Not caught up. DONE. Who-ho. It really bothers me that it is never really DONE, which is why I put off doing it in the first place. So anyway... I've spent hours staring at the glass window of my front-loading Frigidaire, waiting for a spin cycle that never comes. I performed a miracle - I found the owners' manual. I even got on-line and watched a tutorial on how to operate the thing in hopes of finding a clue as to its malady. On to figuring out if the cycles are just not working. I try it empty, I try a few clothes. I try the long cycle, the short cycle and the delicate cycle. I try it with a fast final spin and a normal final spin. It doesn't HAVE a final spin, and it will fill up with water, and it is capable of draining water if the hose is pointed toward a bucket and maneuvered just so, but it won't apparently spin-cycle and drain on its own. And mostly I am mad at myself for spending four hours to learn absolutly nothing of value concerning the repair of my Frigidaire.
I think you can don your heavily jeweled crown as a mother when you're cleaning poop out of the bathtub and you realize it's the first time the thing has been cleaned in like two months. Then you rationalize that two baths a night (okay, okay let's say 5 nights out of seven - or sometimes it's one child but not the other) means that it's fairly clean anyway, right? And then you pat yourself on the back for actually getting out the Comet and cleaning it, not just wiping it down with the nearest damp washcloth and letting the shower run to rinse it down. AND you realize the child hasn't had this sort of accident in like 8 months, so you must be doing SOMETHING right. Not to cross the line between disgusting and funny, I just have to tell you that I think my 4-year-old's slight accident tonight was some sort of bad karma (if I believed in karma) for the internal gut-busting laugh I had on Monday when I arrived at Tyler's (the 4-year-old) Tae Kwon Doe practice. (Yeah, I'm all for teaching violence as early as possible.- or it could be the discipline and respect part I'm after.) I walked in and my husband said, "I hate you." He then proceeded to explain that Mackenzie (the 11 month old) had a #2 that filled her diaper and overflowed all the way up her back. And when a Dad describes consistency and odor in such detail, it is truly alarming. He was trying to get the kids out the door and to practice on time, so he pretty much just wiped her down with an entire refill bag full of baby wipes. And she's the world's worst wriggle-worm, so you can imagine the added stress in cleaning up the exploded diaper. So I smiled at him, with just a little laugh. And that's why he hates me - he knew inside I was rolling on the floor laughing, imagining him pinning her down at an arms length and trying not to puke while he changed her. Hee Hee.... Moments a father should have more often because the Mom already knows too well what it's like. He handed her to me, and she smelled horribly of baby wipes and baby poop. When we got home, I gave her a bath. After all, the tub was clean...
Okay, so I took this quiz on on urlLink beliefnet from my sister-in-laws livejournal. Though I don't need a quiz to tell me where I fall religiously, it is a fairly interesting little gimmick. Choose the answer that most closely resembles the belief you have and viola! your labeled in a category as broad as the aisles in Wal-Mart. I hope people aren't putting too much stock in this. I agree with the number one category that I fall into, and I agree with the Biblical belief that God has given us fellowship with other believers as a core element of faith. But fellowship and faith are not RELIGION. My sister-in-law came back as a Liberal Quaker. (Huh?) Ever read "The Case for Christ"? Religion is why there is unrest in the Middle East. Religion is an excuse for people to sleep in on Sunday morning and gripe about how so-and-so at church is such a hypocrit so why should I go? Religion is misunderstanding of what the God that loves you wants out of your relationship with Him. Yeah, I'm Southern Baptist and I fall in to that protestant "aisle", but you know what? I found a church to belong to because God says that the church is his "body" here on earth and we each have a purpose in it, just as each part of the human body is given a specific function. People are human and they let you down. That's why you shouldn't get wrapped up in the lives of the people of the church you belong to but instead focus on God and get wrapped up in the part he has for you to play, in church and in the world. Okay, so I understand I am ranting and raving... and probably opening up some healthy debate. I say bring it on. But don't bring it until you've read "The Case for Christ" and your Bible.

Any doctor will tell you that an alarming number of pregnancies end in first trimester miscarriage. It makes sense if you think about all the things that have to come together perfectly to form that little tiny life inside of a woman. It's truly a miracle that it ever works at all. When it doesn't, though, all of the knowledge and statistics in the world mean nothing. I remember the day that I miscarried my first child as if it were yesterday. I remember the grey sky, the drizzling rain, the smell of the air, the song on the car radio as my husband, James, drove us home from the hospital. It was October 5, 1997. We had been married for three and a half months when I found out I was 6 weeks and 2 days pregnant. We weren't ready for a baby yet, but the general consensus in the family was that you can never be ready for a baby, and that we would be just fine. Exactly six days after I found out, I came home from work to find that I was spotting. I called my mother who at that time lived in a different state. I called everyone I knew for some sort of reassurance that it didn't mean anything and that my baby was okay. As I began to feel cramps, I knew it wasn't okay. I think I had known from the first spot of blood that there wouldn't be a baby to hold in eight months. That night was a sleepless one. My husband tried to comfort me, telling me "Don't worry, my son is going to be okay." Eventually the cramps became fairly painful, and the bleeding had worsened. James took me to the emergency room. I remember shivering in the hospital gown as the doctor on duty checked me out. He wouldn't give me any definitive answers. He said though my cervix was partially open, I may still be sustaining a pregnancy and recommended I go to my OB/GYN the next day for an ultrasound. We arrived at the office early the next morning, and watching pregnant patients and new mothers enter an exit the office building just about killed me. My doctor performed an ultrasound, and could not find a gestational sac. Those moments were a blur for me, and all I can remember is how he spouted out statistics and said, "You're young... you can keep trying, you may even have another miscarriage. Once you've had three, then we'll start testing you to see if there's a problem." He was cold and short and I don't think I have ever hated another human being the way I hated that doctor at that moment. The attending nurse hugged me tightly, and she was the first of many who would seem to come out of the woodwork with miscarriage stories. She told me how her first ended much the same way and that sometimes when you are young, the first time your body just doesn't know what to do and there's nothing you can do about it. I felt helpless and damaged. As someone who doesn't accept failure easily, I felt as though the loss of human life that I had carried for 7 short weeks and only known about for one was completely my fault. Surely I had done something wrong. I didn't drink enough orange juice... I shouldn't have continued to do my nightly light work out once I found out I was pregnant.... I had doomed the life inside of me by thinking that I wasn't ready yet... I could think of a million reasons why I was to blame. James dropped me off at the house that day, where my friend Karen was waiting to keep me company. She hugged me and pointed to the table where she had set up Monopoly. She was about seven months pregnant herself, and though it pained me to think of her child-bearing success I was happy to have her with me. I was upset that my husband was still required to go to work after such an event. I knew that life had to go on and that the pain would lessen, but I longed to have him with me . I thought to myself that he was probably happy to go to work so that he wouldn't have to be with a blubbering basketcase all day. It was apparent that he didn't know what to say to me. It wasn't apparent how he felt about the miscarriage until he walked through the door twenty minutes after he had left me with Karen. He was with Rhonda, his twin sister, whom he works for. She told me that he had walked into the office and said, "We lost the baby.", then burst into tears. She cried right along with him and they both decided they needed to be with me. After a while, the unexpected boughts of sadness subsided, and were eventually replaced with an irrational obsession with figuring out why it had happened. Several women, aquaintances, friends and co-workers, had miscarriage stories to tell. It is almost as if there is this club of women who have dealt with the loss of a pregnancy, but you don't even know about it until you confide in them that you have lost one of your own. I was surprised that women with several children had experienced one or two miscarriages. Some had trouble conceiving or had even lost a child in the second or third trimester. I began to surf the internet for answers on early term miscarriages in perfectly healthy women with no family history of infertility or child bearing complications. In chat rooms, I found women talking about progesterone levels. The more research I did, the more I began to realize that doctors are not gods or miracle workers, and it was the first time in my life that I realized that I had to take charge of my own health care issues. When I found out I was pregnant, it was confirmed in the doctors office with a urine test after I had taken a home test that showed a very slight positive a few days earlier. I remember telling the doctor that I didn't feel pregnant. They drew blood that day for the standard tests, and it wasn't until this past year that I would know the results of that test and how they could have changed my life. In all my research, I learned that progesterone is the hormone needed to keep the uterus a friendly environment to a growing embryo or fetus. It spikes each month in fertile days or throughout pregnancy and drops dramatically in the days before delivery. The lessening of progesterone levels in a woman's system prompts the uterus to contract and expel either the monthly lining that has built up or the full-term baby in the form of labor. If a woman's progesterone level at conception is not optimum, it is most likely that a miscarriage will occur unless she uses a progesterone supplement in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy. Some of the symptoms of low progesterone levels included longer monthly cycles or irregularity and absence of normal pregnancy symptoms, and difficulty conceiving. The more I read about low progesterone, the more I knew that this was my complication. I was still very young and had not thought to consult my doctor about my findings and inquire about the results of the blood test I had taken. On July 23, 1998, I found out I was pregnant again. Gripped with fear but armed with information, when the doctor's office confirmed the pregnancy, I asked to have a blood test immediatly and requested progesterone supplements. My doctor seemed a little surprised by my request but seemed to humor me in light of my earlier miscarriage. A week or so later his nurse called to tell me that my original progesterone levels were in fact "a little low", so I should continue the supplements and was to come in for an ultrasound just to confirm that everything was okay. Even though I knew in my heart that this time would be different, I still had nightmares before that ultrasound that I would once again be presented with some sort of horrible news. Instead, it was the ultimate best thing I have ever seen on a television - the healthy beating heart of my son. At 7 weeks and two days gestation, his first picture resembled a peanut. It had taken us ten months to conceive after my miscarriage. the longer it took, the more I was convinced of the progesterone problem. My thoughts were confirmed by that blood test, but I shudder to think that if I had not taken the initiative to know about progesterone and its role in a pregnancy, I might have lost my son as well. 4 years later, in June of 2002, I received the good news once again. And once again, I requested bloodwork and supplements. Due to insurance issues, I had to change my OB/GYN provider during this pregnancy. I was about three months pregnant when I received records from my original OB/GYN to transfer to the new office. I came home with that folder and rifled through it like a madwoman. My husband asked me what I was doing and made some comment about not knowing what anything in there meant and that you can't read doctors' handwriting anyway. But I found it. Three pieces of paper that didn't change anything but made a world of difference. They were blood test results, and all of them had a column clearly marked "progesterone". The one from 1997 was at 6.5. 6.5 what, I don't know. But that was extremely low considering the test from July of 1998 was at 10.2 and the June 2003 one at 14. On my next appointment, I asked the nurse midwife who would later deliver my daughter what the normal progesterone level should be. She said something to the effect that they would treat anything under 12 at about 7 or 8 weeks of pregnancy. Though nothing will bring the lost baby back, I know that that child existed for a reason. That reason was for me to take control of my health and fertility and for me to pass on what I have learned about to other women who have gone through the same thing. When you've lost a child early in pregnancy, people have a way of trying to comfort you by minimizing the loss. They say you're young and have plenty of time to fill your house with children. They say it happened for a reason, that the baby was imperfect in some genetic way and you're better off if it wasn't going to be a healthy child. Some believe that it is the loss of a pregnancy, not a human life. Whatever it is to you, you have to deal with it in your own way. The perfectionist in me drove me to find the fault and correct it, and I thank God every day that I was able to do so. For many women, the problem isn't so easy to solve. It is discomforting to know, though, that many women have lost children to similar problems that could easily be prevented. When I think back on the events of my miscarriage, I don't place blame anymore, but I often wonder if my child would not have been lost had my doctor listened to me a little more closely or raised an eyebrow at my slightly positive home test result. I look at my beautiful children every day and marvel at the miracle that they are. Sometimes I wonder what my lost baby would've looked like, or I replay the event of my miscarriage in my mind. If you've had a miscarriage, you know what I mean. I don't dwell on the loss, but it is always with me. I've joined the club. Every once in a while, a friend or acquaintance will relay news of a miscarriage. I feel their pain, and for a moment, I feel mine all over again. Then I tell my story so they can know that they are not alone, and that there is a future to hope for.

Well, here I am.... only enlightened yesterday about "blogs", I can't wait to get addicted!!! Thanks to you, Redhead Muse!
Mackenzie woke up at her usual time this morning, in the usual manner - wailing in baby jargon about the injustice of being ignored while mom tries to sneak in five more minutes of sleep. After several "snooze" episodes of the alarm clock and the definite unanswered prayer for Mackenzie to put herself back to sleep for half an hour, I realize I have lost the battle. I roll out of bed and burst into her room with a smile and open arms, exclaiming, "Good morning, Princess Mackenzie!!" She's such a drama queen, and she laughs in that patented 11-month old gurgle, smiles with all four of her front teeth beaming, and I know she's forgiven me for the 17 minutes she has been awake without parental entertainment. The greatest invention in the world, even above the telephone and the internet (Oh!), are these cool saucer things that resemble baby walkers but they go no where. The genious that invented them attached several gadgets and toys to the top of the saucer, and you put your baby right in the middle of it. They can play and bounce, but they can't disappear down the hall in search of the nearest potential hazard. Call it lazy parenting, but these things have CHANGED THE WORLD. Once Mackenzie is awake and ready for action, the first thing she does is have a round in the bouncer. So today, I put her in the bouncer and gave her the regulatory morning bottle, which has recently been favored as vanilla soymilk instead of formula. (A computed savings of like $30 a month - thanks, Mackenzie!) As my world begins to get crazy with the impending work to be done this morning, the declared disaster of a house needing to be cleaned and a four-year-old that REFUSES to get ready to go to grandma's unless he can wear his new authentic Motocross get-up that Granpa got him for Christmas, I grab the nearest thing edible for Mackenzie. Goldfish. She loves those little orange cheezy goldfish. So I set a handful down on her saucer's surface, and think briefly that maybe this constitutes eating while standing up, since technically she's not sitting down. And I heard somewhere that eating while standing up just isn't good for you. Not only that, I don't think I've ever seen anything endorsing goldfish as a "complete and balanced" breakfast. In fact, they may come dangerously close to being junk food. "At least I'm not feeding her a bottle of Coke and a bag of M's for breakfast", I think to myself. I smile because that sounds like a perfect breakfast to me and chock it up to reasons #2258 and #2259 of why I will not be receiving the Mother of the Year Award. But you know, she's beautiful and healthy and happy to have goldfish for breakfast.
To Redheaded Muse (from now on referred to as "Phoebe"): Thanks for the new addiction. - Christaleigh
Looks like the first one didn't take.... a test post..... HELLOOOOO????
I spent an hour and a half last night in an internal claustrophobic rage. We took the girls (Miss Alamogordo and Miss Otero County) to the local MA Pageant for Silver City. I won't even go into the painful program (or lack thereof), but right as the Lifestyle and Fitness (AKA Swimsuit) Competition began, Jorge Humungous sat in the seat next to me. We're in an auditorium, so there is that unspoken rule of not crossing the armrest of the person next to you in the event that you don't know them. Jorge was PAINFULLY unaware of the auditorium rules. From the moment he sat down, he flopped his Letterman-jacket clad arms over into my personal space, making me excruciatingly nervous. As if that wasn't rude enough, he was one of these guys that apparently must be so blessed that he can't stay within the seat boundaries with his legs either, so his left leg was also breaching my territory, I had the notion to change the direction I had my legs crossed in and jam the heel of my shoe right in his calf. But I'm nice, so I really just tried to ignore him. You'd think the story ends there. Uh-uh. For almost 2 hours, while being deprived of precious personal space, I also had to smell him, too. And all I could think of was that "Here's to You, Mr. Man Who Wears Too Much Cologne" commercial. Isn't that a beer commercial? Anyway, the emotional pain of last night's torture is only surpassed by the physical pain of giving birth. Why can't people realize when they are invading someone's space? I'm certain it was obvious how uncomfortable I was, and you would think a young man with that much need for room would find any of the other ample unoccupied seats without a neighbor to harass a better choice to watch a small town pageant. Ugh. The nerve of some people.
I am impressed with my parenting skills tonight!!! I actually was able to put some sort of method to the madness in this household and BOTH children were tucked in fast asleep by 9 pm! That's happened a time or two before, but tonight, I feel like I made some headway with Tyler. I've been feeling like he is the text-book example of a sleep-deprived child. His normal routine is up at 9 am, play, play, play, fall asleep in the car somewhere around 6 pm (because he won't take a nap any earlier in the day), up at 8pm til about 2 am... This is where the fifth member of our family butts in. The VCR. Mom and Dad can't take Tyler's restlesness, so his usual pattern leaves us bitter and defeated and all we can do is say "stay in your bed and watch this movie". Yes, aweful, AWEFUL parents we are. So it has become a number-one crusade of mine to get the kid to sleep at a decent hour, to get him to learn how to fall asleep on his own (no VCR, mom or dad), to not pee in his jammies, and to get up at a decent hour. I know what you are thinking. (All you need is a good routine!) Yes, a good routine and some Benadryl. (Just kidding, I would say only one night out of every six months do I actually contemplate drugging him.) The first battle I have fought on this crusade is getting the hubby to play along. Someone agrees a good routine will come in handy but doesn't like to join mommy in the ranks of bad guy, and therefore doesn't want to get tough about bedtime. I'm at a little bit of a stale mate on this one, because I am being supported - but on nights when I'm gone, like I will be tomorrow, I know it will be Pirates of the Caribbean three times until I get home. Yay. Excuse me, Pirates are out (sorry Orlando) - and Spy Kids 3 is in (can't beat a pair of 3-D glasses). Ah, to my point. I have, in my very basic knowledge of child psychology, realized that too much change too soon will just backfire on me and I will lose faith that I can do this . So I have taken it one step at a time. Last week, I focused on turning all the TV's in the house off at 8. Then I read to both of the kids in Mackenzie's room for about 15 minutes. We put her to bed (Thank God that she has so far learned a healthy sleep behavior pattern- she puts herself to sleep like a pro!) and then Tyler and I would go lay down in his room, no movie. We did that three nights, and the other nights were kind of the same, he fell asleep to a movie. Tonight, I put Mackenzie down, then me, daddy and Tyler all pile in Tyler's bed. Daddy read a book and when it was over he left and it was "lights out". Now last week, it took lots of fighting on my part to get Tyler to sleep without a movie. Tonight, he asked once, tried to talk a little and then went right to sleep. The other times it was still 10 or 11 before he was asleep, and I felt discouraged because even starting the routine at 8 pm didn't seem to help. I was prepared for another long night of focusing my efforts on getting him to sleep, and was SOSOSOSOSOSO impressed that within 15 minutes, he was out. So there is hope. It's a slow process, but a worthy cause. If only I could question where he gets his night-owl genes. (From me, the girl who happily blogs until 1am or works until 4am or occasionally just watches TV for the sake of not being able to sleep. UGH.) I hear it is in fact inherited, and ultimately if he is going to be night owl he can do it when there is no one else to blame his sleep deprivation on but himself.
The debate could rage on forever about the right or wrong of homosexuality. I can respect that and I can respect the side of that argues that people are born gay. Wired that way. It's genetics. My answer to that is that there have been studies about serial killers and the most brutal of murderers that show that they, too, were "born that way". That doesn't make their actions right and it certainly doesn't give them special rights as a minority group. (Though I think a few Democrats could make a compelling case about it...) And I'm straight. Yes, born that way. I am proud that the President I voted for is taking a stand, because to me, refusing to take a stand is a volitile way of life. I saw interviews with people on the news in the last few days, and some of them are of the opinion "let other people do what they want as long as it doesn't affect me". But they are ignorant because passing a law to recognize same sex marriages does affect them. Already, I have thought about how I could possibly explain to my children that the government thinks it's okay for a man to marry a man or woman to marry a woman, but God doesn't. Because, see, I may be a minority in my belief that God's view of marriage is the only few of marriage, and I have right to shelter my children from people who would teach otherwise. Since we've taken God out of everything else, then gay people wishing to get married need to realize that God didn't sanction that. Have we forgotten about Soddom and Gomorrah? Has God not told us what becomes of societies that allow freely homosexuality? Don't confuse my disagreement with intolerance. I know a few gay people and I don't think by virtue of being gay that you've purchased a one-way ticket to hell. God is also loving and forgiving, and one must only come to Him with faith that Jesus Christ died for our sins to be saved. The second part of salvation is repentance. And I think a gay person may realize that their lifestyle is not what God intended but they can know no other way, and in that light they should be respectful enough of God, the Christian religion, and Biblical teachings to not ask that their relationship be recognized by God and society as a marital union. For the Bible says, "...in the beginning the Creator made them male and female, and said for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh." And compellingly enough, in the same passage in (In Matthew 19), after being questioned about divorce, Jesus tells the disciples "...for some are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it." Which I believe is telling us that you should only choose marriage of you can accept the laws of God that come with it. Of course, we could go on and on... I am fearful that a laisez-faire attitude toward gay marriage is like pulling th plug on the human race. There is a specific NON BIBLICAL reason that man and woman exist, and that's also to keep the human race alive. And though the nuclear family seems to be a thing of the past, I can't accept a couple of gay women to have children by some guy who's happy he'll never have to commit, or a couple of gay guys that convince their best friend to bear children they can raise without her. I'm not saying these people are incapable parents, I'm just saying it's not right, it is not what God intended for us, and if one of my children grows up and announces homosexuality, I will love them all the same but I will never agree with the lifestyle.
That poor guy from American Idol... How pathetic is it that the American public is having a cheap laugh at his expense over and over and over...and over again? Something about this reminds me of those smelly kids that you picked on in the third grade. Deep inside you felt bad for them, but your friends made fun of them and you didn't want to be an outcast so you laughed along with them. Are we all in the third grade now? Yeah, sure, it was funny when he was the highlight of one of the "You Suck" episodes of American Idol, but please, can we quit torturing this guy? Did you see that news clip on Entertainment Tonight where they had him sing Elton John's "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"? Let's put it this way - no tune and "vagabond" he pronounced "WAGABOND". He can't help it. His family probably came to America trying to live the American dream. I don't think public humiliation is part of that. Can somebody put a stop to this nonsense?
I'm pretty proud of myself right now. It's almost 3 am, and I have successfully pulled together some interesting information in a site I am building as a "Guide in Training" for About.com. If you've read my previous blogs you may be wondering why in the world I would take on something like a new job that entails computer skills I have yet to learn. My answer is two-fold. 1. I have a grand plan. If they accept me and my writing/web-publishing skills as a guide for About.com, I will have enough "invisible" income to go ahead and move into the office space I am so desprately coveting right now (more blog on that later...). The pay may not be a whole lot, but it will be easier than trying to fit office space rent into my already-suffocated monthly budget. And 2. It's going to be a great way to be much more well informed about the business I am in. Ignorance doesn't sell, and already in the small amounts of research I've done, I feel like I've climbed another rung on the business information ladder. But you know, the time consuming thing is how to build things onto the website. Somewhere in my clumsy publishing, I came across a "help" section that started tallking about widgets. It didn't say what a widget was, though, and I feel like a dork asking my About.com mentor. Wouldn't someone who applied for this job already know what a widget was? Not me. So if you are familiar with widgets, please pass your knowledge on to me. It's late, and there is no doubt that I'll dream tonight about a small furry widget that hides somewhere n my computer and does things I don't know about. Scary.
I'm looking for a lobbyist to bring forth a bill to add a tax credit for people that are gullable enough to prepare their own taxes. The tax credit would compensate me for the two years of lifespan that I lost last night while attempting to file online. First, the anticipation of hitting that "DONE" button at the end is worse than waiting for pregnancy test results. Thoughts of "Do I owe? Can't be that much... I'll be happy to break even... What can I spend a refund on?... What if I get audited?... Estimating isn't lying, right??..." run rampant through your brain, causing a severe headache, sweaty palms and an increased pulse. And that just made me light-headed because I had just finished working out. (See 135and28inches blog for reference.) Seriously, I hadn't felt so anxious since the day I found out I WAS in fact pregnant with Mackenzie. So you can imagine my near-heart attack when the nice little computer program told me I owed the IRS $1450. Uh, yeah. Right. Convinced I made a serious error but it was not obvious, I compounded my stress in search of last year's tax return. You never can find crap like that when you are looking for it. Okay, I found it and returned to the dreaded computer. Enter the 4-year-old that refuses to sleep, once again. It's like 10:30. Some of my frustration undoubtedly spilled on to him as I told him to do whatever he wants just leave me alone to finish this. (I'm surprised I didn't find him later in the back yard riding his ATV in boxer shorts only.) I compared 2002 to the information I was keying in, scouring both documents for differences. After 20 minutes, there it was. A-DUH. Double DUH. The third question down asks if you have dependent exemptions. I failed to check it, therefore the neat little program didn't ask me for the names and info on my kiddos. And there's an extra one this year. And if you fill that part out you get the nifty little child tax credit, too. WOW. So I go back, enter their info, and VIOLA! They pop up on that first page. I get back to that nasty little "DONE" button at the end and ask God to forgive me for actually praying that my dumb error makes a drastic difference. God's pretty good at answering my prayers, because -button pushed- I'm now the proud recipient of a thousand dollar refund. YEE-HA! In my defense, the area of the online program I used that asked all the "situational" questions so you could fill out the right forms was vague in the area of dependent exemptions. Let's cut the bull crap and in the future change that line to simply "If you have kids, and they are yours, check here." And on that subject, let's add my proposed credit. Next year I expect to see "If last year's return nearly killed you, check here." And then I expect like an immediate $500 straight credit. Do you think the IRS will agree????
As I went through my day today, I was nagged by feelings of discomfort stemming from several recent events with church, family and co-workers alike. Of course we can all feel the black-hole suction of an oncoming pity party, but I don't think that's what this is. I think it is actually the opposite. I realized, or actually "re-realized" a few things this week. I love my mom. She is my day care, and she was gone this week. The task of taking care of the every whim of a 4 year old and a one year old isn't a mystery to me, of course, but the amount of things I am trying to do with my life comes to a screeeeeeching halt when day care ceases. I asked myself over and over again this week why I didn't make the choice to be a stay at home mom. Oh, yeah - I remember. I wasn't given the choice... And though I'd love to blame that on my husband, it can only be blamed on my incessant need to WANT everything. I think I am borderline crazy and that I can't "settle" into anything. James has worked for the same company for almost 12 years. He's had promotions and is making a decent sum of money, but somewhere deep inside it drives me nuts that he never displays the selfish need to "find himself" or define his life goals. It took me a few years of marriage to realize that his life goal is providing for his family, and I think just as I was not given the choice to be a stay at home mom, he has never been given the chance to explore what he'd like to do with his life because you can't raise a family on ambition alone. But me, I'm crazy. One minute I want to declare bankruptcy and stay at home and play with my kids all day, never having the need for pantyhose again. The next I am planning out how I am going to make six figures this year and the amount of time I am willing to commit to it. And since I'm my own boss, I find myself trailing the thought of unlimited income with how nice it would be to just show up and not have so much weight on these here shoulders. And then there's the grand discovery... of course I want to write. And be good at it. Which could take a long time. Because I am certain I break just about all of the grammar rules that exist, and I can't quite remember what a dangling participle is... And the I come back to earth. The most important thing that I realized this week is that my trials, my ambition, my drive to figure out what the perfect balance is - these things are key to my personality. I'm concerned for a friend of mine who seems to be struggling with her job and with her relationships. There are many excuses, and some very pertinent and valid roadblocks and extinuating circumstances. Being someone who has already professed to be wishy-washy with my wants, I understand where she is. And this week I came to the conclusion as well that it is somewhat taxing to be everyone's cheerleader all the time, including my own. I think I am the person that I am because of the things that I want out of life. My dad said from the time I could talk I had to have the last word and as much as that can be and is a bad quality, it can be good. It means I'm determined, and that even though I may not know exactly what I want the big picture to look like I don't ever put down the brush and palette. In fact, I'm probably finger painting. This friend of mine has a mercy problem... she gives and gives and gives to everything and everyone in her life and she has not yet once since I have known her claimed anything for herself. Claimed her place in our company. Claimed her business as her own. Claimed her right to a good relationship with a man that cares about her the way she deserves. And worried. She worries too much. She recently broke up with her boyfriend, and she talked a little about blogging about it. Instead she blogged about Queer Eye For the Straight Guy. Which was amusing, yet not the peek into her soul that I really wanted her to write. She does a great job professing her Democratic zest, but when it comes to putting herself out there for all us girl-pals to read... well. That's her. Hesitant to take a leap, resistant to voicing her innermost wants, shielding herself by not wanting to hurt anyone or speak her truths. And I look at our Pastor, and I wonder how he has the strength to go to that church office day after day, facing opposition head on and very publicly. How he can speak his truth- God's truth, too- and still have strength left to preach the two services on Sunday that are one of the deeply-buried roots of his turmoil. Before my mom left this week, we had an argument, which is something we seldom do. It was one of those arguments sparked by a long line of little things compounded with us both having long, bad days. She told me that I'm wearing too many hats. And I have to agree. But on the other hand there isn't a single one I want to take off. Wife and mother - that's obvious. Can't just kill the husband and sell the kids, definitely wouldn't want to. Servant- as in of God and at church. My life falls apart when I don't include being active at church. I would say there's a reason for that, and it has to do more with pleasing God than pleasing others. Businesswoman - that's the touchy one. The hat I'm wearing because I have to work, thankful to be blessed with such a wonderful opportunity but can also feel that this hat is the heaviest. Because I have to wear this hat, I HAVE to succeed, to make it the best that I can. It's not enough to just show up to work, it never has been for me, and that's how I got the job I have. I often feel though, that if I didn't have to work I would have the perfect spotless house and would be a 100% ambitious mom, and both the kids would be reading War and Peace by now. I also wear the peacemaker and the eternal optimist hats. Though not occupations, I find myself in roles that force me to feel like I have to make everyone happy and like I am personally responsible for bringing light to situations or pointing out the silver lining. If you include my desire to go back to school, my novel beginnings and throw in a few Miss Alamogordo/Miss Otero County traveling companion duties, I would say that sums up the things that fill my day. I guess looking at that it is obvious why I feel like I never really get anything done. And maybe I could have myself a little pity party about the stress of being me, but in reality, I love it. I would give up the job in heartbeat if I could, to focus on family. But since I can't, I have to be the best that I can at both, and I know that in the long run my family will benefit from my efforts on both fronts. Maybe if I would quit blogging... duh. I suppose airing out dirty laundry is in the air this week, for there certainly is a lot of that going down. I wish I could fix things. I wish I could keep my friend pumped up. I wish I could shield the Pastor from hurtful people. I wish I could feel balance between family and work every day. And I wish I weren't afraid to write the next chapter of my novel. This blog is my excuse for not working on THAT tonight. UGH!
I believe tonight I saw more mud being thrown around in a meeting than any Democrat could do with a 2-minute spot during the superbowl. Where was I at? Church, of course... A business meeting at church this evening was the epic event in my day, and as usual will be the thought that keeps me awake for several hours beyond bedtime if I don't blog about it and let the frustration exit my body via my fingers... That said, I (a.) Think that senior citizens take advantage of the common person who somehow missed memorizing the Whoever's Laws of Public Meetings or whatever you want to call it. Parliamentary procedure. I would say that tonight's 3 hour meeting could've accomplished the same goals sans geriatric rambling about amending the motion before the board.... What? Second the motion and move to amend the first motion and then discuss that and then move to motion to blah blah blah.... these church mentors basically want to vote on whether or not something should be voted on! (b.) Hope that in my golden years my vision has not narrowed so much as to see only that I am offended when someone doesn't ask my permission for them to do their job. You know, we pick leaders all the time, and I would venture to say that the church setting is probably one of the few where the leader's actions are scrutinized to the point of ineffectiveness. I mean, come on. He's the Pastor because he's qualified, Mr. X, Y and Z are not the Pastor, because THEY ARE NOT QUALIFIED. They cannot do his job anymore than he could step into their offices and run their businesses. Their assumption that they have a RIGHT to know how he is running his "business" (of church) and that they get a say in every decision is as ridiculous as him showing up at their businesses and auditing their books to make sure they gave their whole 10% tithe. There's a line to be drawn, and we pick leaders because someone has to lead, someone has to follow. Apparently those that aren't following are just making a lot of noise. (c.) Pray that we all get back to the point. It's all about the Great Commission, and that IS the Pastor's job. I won't question the manner in which he procedes to fulfill God's Commission for Christians, and though right now down to my core I want to leave the people in that church as far behind me as I can, I won't. Because I know that the exact same people exist in other churches just with different names and faces. I guess they call them the devil's advocate for a reason, and church wouldn't be the same without them. Final thoughts on my night: I'm exhausted. I can only imagine what my Pastor and his family feels tonight. They need all of the warm fuzzies projected towards them that they can get, so if you would be so inclined, please stop and say a little prayer. Take it from me, he's on the right path. If he wasn't, he wouldn't have such opposition, right? And I never believed more that God would answer prayers to comfort someone as I know He will answer for Charles and Brenda.
In a desert land, much like ours, lived a flock of sheep. Long ago, the land was fertile and there was a huge tree in the middle of it. It was a tall, strong tree, and offered plenty of shade from the hot desert sun. But now the tree was dead, and it though it offered little protection from the elements, the sheep that grew up in it's shade wouldn't leave it. The master of the flock had, over the years, had to deal with countless obstacles in order to keep his flock healthy and growing. The flock of sheep had become two separate groups - there were the ones that realized that the land was starving them and was not a good environment. These sheep could see a greener pasture just on the other side of a fence at the edge of the land. Of course, the fence was high, they could not scale it. It was anchored in the ground, they could not go under it. The second group were the sheep that would not leave their spots under the tree that once protected them. They would not venture to see the land on the other side of the fence. They would not look up and admit that their tree was dead and could protect them no longer. The master, realizing the degree of danger that his flock was in, hired a new shepherd. He explained to the shepherd: "Go into my land and teach these sheep to follow you. I have purchased the lush, green grazing pasture on the other side of the fence. It is very important, though, that all of the sheep come together. So listen to my instructions carefully. There are sheep under the tree who might rather die than follow you. There are other sheep who will trample over you to get to that land when they see you are tearing down the fence. However, if you can not get them all to follow you, they will all surely die in that landscape. You may not lead them to the other side until you can get all of them to go. Not one will be left behind." The next day the shepherd reported to the master that the entire flock was safe and sound on the other side of the fence, enjoying their new pasture. The master was impressed with the shepherd, and said, "I have had shepherds for years try to move that flock from under that tree. How is it that you accomplished in one day what they could not accomplish in several years?" "That's easy," said the shepherd. "I just cut down that big dead tree." I think some of the people in our church are mad because their tree got cut down, and the shepherd didn't ask for permission from the sheep to chop it down. Some people don't realize how difficult the task is that was given to the shepherd, that the entire flock had to come together before they could all enjoy the new land. And the master's instructions were to bring them all - to leave not even one behind. He never said 'don't touch the tree'. He just commissioned the shepherd to bring them all, and he accomplished that task. I believe, of course, that God is the Master, Pastor Charles is the shepherd, and obviously we all agreed to let him lead God's plan in our church- we voted for him unanimously. How far worse would it be for the shepherd to take the easy route, cutting down the fence to let those that wanted to move on, and leave the others under the tree to die, if that was their will? That, of course, is not his job and you are standing in the way of the Master's instruction if you expect the shepherd to ask the sheep for approval every time he changes the landscape to keep the flock alive.
Nastygrams? Love letters? What would you do if you could leave a message to be delivered to a specified person only after your death? Thanks to a whimsical visit to urlLink Dave Barry's Blog , I found just the thing to urlLink complete my life even after death . This could even be better than the life insurance I attempt to sell. At least insurance is more like a legacy, a chance to complete what the deceased started, or what they wished for their children and grandchildren. This is just ridiculous. I wish they'd show a sample of a letter left, or testimonies. Just think of how many people must (a.) be dumb enough to purchase this and (b.) proving in the hereafter just what a coward they were in life. Way to have people remember you! I wonder if they let you change the heading for free, like if you originally left a love poem for wife #1, but married 7 times before you died. It would downright suck for a bitter divorcee to receive a forgotten letter post-mortem, especially if the hubby had recently married a Swedish personal trainer young enough to be is granddaughter. EEEeeewww, the potential.....
This is the blog I've been avoiding for two days. My daughter turned one this past Saturday, and it was quite the bittersweet event for me. She arose cheerily as usual at about 8:30 a.m., and all day long as I looked at her, I struggled to burn into my memory the way she looked and the little things she did. With Tyler, I was naive about the time that passed as he was a baby. There are pictures all over the place of him when he was one, but I swear I barely remember it. Unless some sort of divine intervention occurs, Mackenzie will always be the baby - what are the statistics again on women who get pregnant AFTER having their tubes tied? Don't misunderstand, I don't really want or need and certainly can't afford another baby, but the passing of "the baby's" first birthday sure brought the biological clock feelings up again. Tick, tock. Not only that, her birthday seemed to force me to really examine the blessings in my life and count them one by one. There are so many things that I love about my family that I never really verbally recognize. We spend so much time going through the motions of everyday life- the changing of diapers and taking out of trash, the making of beds and CONSTANTLY doing of laundry. (Ugh don't get me started.) This weekend I really thanked God for all the little things - the way my daughter is always in a good mood in the morning, and the way the morning sun shines through her window and she smiles and giggles when I come in and pick her up. Better then waking up to a Starbucks attached to my house every day. For my son, who never just asks why. It's always a thoughtful question to ponder, like "Tyler, look at the pretty full moon!", and he says "Yeah, mommy, is it in Albuquerque or Georgia?" and I have to enter into a deep discussion about satellites and space. But it's never just "why?" and I love that about him. For my daughter, who goes absolutely nuts for M's. And if you try to eat them in front of her without sharing, she turns into a wild wailing beast. For my son, who drew a picture of a treehouse that every adult that passes by can quickly mistake for male anatomy. He delights in the giggles and the comments that his "tree house" gets, and he thinks it is a darn good drawing of one. For my husband, who rocks and changes and sleeps with the kids, and even occasionally does the dishes without being nagged or bribed into it. For his twin sister, who has become my sister over the years, the one thing my parents never gave me. And for those parents of mine, who love us all and spoil their grandkids - for the grandpa that Mackenzie reaches for when he comes home, to dance with and then roll around on the floor, "wrestling" with Big Brother. For the grandma that teaches letters and numbers and helps me clean my house when life is too hectic. For the grandpa that inpires Tyler to ride a motorcycle and to clean and polish his Lil' Tykes ATV and to ALWAYS wear his helmet. There are so many more, and the funny thing aout counting blessings is that you can't ever find a good place to stop. All weekend long I had the Alabama song "Never Be One Again" in my mind, and as I counted my blessings, I also thought of the future. I thought of how odd it is to be excited about watching your kids grow, wondering what kind of teenager they will be, who it is they'll fall in love with, what talent they will discover God has given them, and then in the same breath wish that they will NEVER be teenagers, they will NOT be allowed to date and how I'd do anything to keep them babies for just a moment longer. I know am a little biased, but my kids are beautiful. They are both guaranteed to be the center of much attention from the oppposite sex, and part of me can't wait to see how they grow through relationships. And the only thing I can do is pray constantly that they make good choices. There's another song I thought of this weekend, called urlLink "The Winner by Coolio (its on the Space Jam soundtrack). It presents many profound motivational thoughts in a rap context, but the line that sticks with me is "It all starts at home, once they're grown they gone and once they're on their own you got to leave them alone..." I guess I have a few years before I have to leave them alone. But I realize that day will come, and I know that no matter how many pictures we have, the memories of first birthdays and baby looks will fade as time takes its toll. And when someone out there figures out how to slow down or turn back the clock, just pass that info on to me.
Okay, my own Christian views aside - I think it is AWESOME that urlLink Mel Gibson is coming out with a movie that depicts Christ's torture and death. Biblical reference also aside, it is about time that someone in Hollywood step up to the plate and show the other end of the spectrum. When we live in a society that's used to bloody mulitple body counts, frivolous sex, gay relationships and marriages and acceptable drug abuse in any and every movie worth $7.50, it is sad that a proven true piece of history that happens to have significant eternal consequences to many Christians such as myself is ignored or controversial based on the fact that Christ is in it. (Well, not Him, but you know, ABOUT Him) Do people not realize that even the most stout atheist must admit that during Christ's time there was also murder, greed, corruption... all the key elements of a good movie which I am sure will be given their due weight in this one. I guess what I am saying is funny how you could take a guy named George, tell a story about how he lived 2000 years ago and how he claimed outrageous things, was put to death after being betrayed by a friend, and after he died and aweful death, his ghost came back to haunt them, and that would be sheer entertainment, good story, interesting characters. Call Him Christ, though, and everybody has a fit. I think it's great. I hope a lot of people go to see it and realize that 2000 years ago someone died for them, so that their life on this earth would only be temporary and pathetic considering what waits on the other side if they will just believe that He was (and is) who he says He was. My Kudos to Mel...
It's my son's 5th birthday today, and I can't believe how time flies. Of course, he has to be the number one most spoiled kid because we not only took a trip to Disney "for his birthday", we are also celebrating today with cake and ice cream and going to Chuck-E-Cheese this weekend. Whoa... it reminds me of those really rich people who have month-long "event" weddings- this has been an "event" birthday for this little guy. So anyway, Tyler was rattling off a list of things he STILL wants 'for his birthday'. ("Tyler, you've gotten enough for your birthday!") So here's his list verbatim: "I would like a snowboarder, and a puppy and an army man with a backpack, AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, a squirrel." Squirrel????? I'm too busy trying to figure out how he got "and last but not least" in his vocabulary, no that its a bad thing. He sounded so official. It was too cute.
Lawyers and people in my profession (insurance sales) have long been the butt of jokes that portray these occupations as... well... swindling? Cheating? No-good dirty rotten scoundrels just out to make a buck?? That's never bothered me, I know I help people with what I do. But tonight I watched this new (can we PUH-lease put an end to this insanity????) reality show on MTV about "I want a famous face". These twin brothers that were born (made by God) to look a little more like one of the cartoon figures on Rugrats, decided they wanted to look like Brad Pitt. The following are the problems I have with this: A. How many cards short of a full deck does one have to be to look in a mirror and think that any amount of plastic surgery will bless them with a likeness of Brad Pitt, once the SEXIEST MAN IN AMERICA?????? B. How do plastic surgeons go to sleep at night when their Rugrat clients come in and say "I want to look like Brad Pitt." I mean, obviously, their doctor's reply was "Yeah, sure we can do that..." Even my hairdresser cringes when you show her a picture of Jennifer Aniston or Madonna or whomever and say "Cut it like hers!!!" In fact, a good hairdresser will say, "Honey, I can't work miracles." And therein lies a big problem. Hair is hair. If Faith Hill's 'short do' on me looks more like Medusa with static, hey, its just hair, it'll grow back. But plastic surgery??? And at like $10,000? C'mon, guys - let's get a grip. Be a good plastic surgeon and tell some people that flaws mean character. C. These guys looked the same after surgery. Noses maybe a little straighter and not so Roman, but definitely not Brad Pitt. D. Did I mention Brad Pitt- Sexiest Man Alive??? I don't necessarily think so. But wanting to look like him is definitely like me walking into a surgeon's office and expecting them to liposuck me into a size six and ask for a face like Nicole Kidman (someone I bear absolutely no natural resemblance to). I'm sure sooner or later someone will invent some sort of "mask grafting" where you just buy someone else's face and have a surgeon overcharge you to sew it on to your head. Until then, Brothers Grimm - you two wasted enough money pay off a few of my credit cards. UGH... the inhumanity of it all.
It's funny how a four-year-old learns geography. We started our long trek back to Alamogordo today, and for those of you that haven't experienced it - driving through Texas is like watching the Twilight Zone in slow motion. It creeps you out at night and seems like it will never end. So we stopped just past the Arkansas border this afternoon for lunch, and Tyler spots the Wal-Mart (it's an amazing gift he has) and asks us where we are. "Texarkana, " James says. "Okay," Tyler answers. Several (SEVERAL) miles down the road, Tyler starts talking about that Wal-Mart we should have went to in Tex-Ar-Canada. The conversation went something like this: Mom: "It's not Tex-Ar-Canada. It's just Tex-ar-KANA." Ty: "But then where is Texarcanada?" Mom: "There's not a Texarcanada." Ty: "Then where were we, just then today?" Mom: "Texarkana." Ty: "Arcanada?" Dad: "She's just saying its name is 'TEXARKANA' not, 'TEXARCANADA'" Tyler: "Oh." Several (SEVERAL) miles later - Tyler: "Dad, how come we didn't stop at that Wal Mart in Texas Arcanada?" Hmmmmm..... Did I mention we are saving for therapy???
We've been on vacation for a bit and I thought it was 'bout time to blog about it. This is no doubt the most wonderful vacation I have been on in a while. To understand that, you'd have to know about the last few vacations I took. (((((((((((((((Flashback......))))))))))))))))) Two years ago in the end of June, we went to Las Vegas with my brother-in-law and sister-in-law. Beyond the fact that it was like walking around on the freakin' sun, I was 12 weeks pregnant. And due to miscommunication/poor planning, the last night we were in town, my husband and I were reduced to sleeping on the HARD floor of my father-in-law's hotel room. (Long-story-short: we were supposed to be staying with a relative of my sis-in-laws, that turned out to be absentee. It was the 3rd of July so soom rates skyrocketed and the coup decision was to stay with my father-in-law who also happened to be in Vegas on business. Unfortunately, he only had a king bed in his room. So his son (Robert) slept next to him, Vanessa slept on the only chair in the room, and James and I were left on the floor.) Let's just say that between hormones and minor mishaps, that vacation was stressful. We went to San Antonio last year around may, and it was a decent trip, although there was MUCH stress in getting lost and turned around on the mess of Texas freeways. It, too, was like hanging out in a broiler. It was also a pretty quick trip, sort of an anniversary surprise for me. The most enjoyable thing was a really nice (ahem... and expensive) dinner at Ruth's Chris Steak House. In November last year, we went back to Vegas. This time, my father and mother-in-law had moved there and served as our hotel. This somehow took the fun out of going "away" on vacation. Not only that, but myself and my daughter spent the majority of the vacation being sick as dogs with that crazy flubug-on-steroids crap. Now- all of these vacations had a particular spot of stress for me that was job related. During all of them, I never 'quit working'. I had my phone and my computer, and tried to stay on top of things and help clients that left messages. I gave quotes, wrote policies, scheduled appointments, and called the home office several times while "on vacation". By the grace of God alone, my business has been fairly successful and this year I decided to hire help while on vacation. I had asked Amanda to work part-time for me as an appointment scheduler, and proposed to her a sum for the week and a half I would be gone if she would keep my phone and call my clients back each day. This act alone has saved my vacation. I admit, I have worked a little - read some email, checked a few on-line things... but for the FIRST timne since signing on with Horace Mann I have had a real vacation. And what wonderful one it has been. We went to Orlando and became genuine tourists- we took our kids to Disney's Animal Kingdom on Friday, the Magic Kingdom on Saturday and Universal Studios on Sunday. Suffice it to say that if we don't go to another theme park in the next five years, my feelings won't be hurt. We had a great time though - No meltdowns, hangups or malfunctions. No spewing, fit-throwing or embarassing displays. And the kids were excellent, too!!! For one split second we thought we lost Tyler, but he was just on the other side of a tree defacing a Mickey flower-bed. Seriously - the weather was beautiful, the kids took our abuse willingly and without complaint, and we spent an obscene amount of money on food and souvenirs. What I have really enjoyed most is seeing family that I haven't really seen in years- cousins that are all grown up now, aunts and uncles that are just like I remember them, grandparents that still hug you and make you feel like you're six years old again. Everyone seems so successful and so... colorful . I really was looking forward to this vacation anyway - and I was not let down. I am so proud to be a part of our family, and have finally matured enough to see the real legacy that a family is. I hope to somehow preserve as much as I can, passing it down to Tyler and Mackenzie.
A few updates: My washer was fixed under warranty with Frigidaire. I have forgiven it of all it's transgressions. My son is sleeping well by himself in his own bed every other night. I say this because the normal routine has become Monday-sleep in bed and pee, Tuesday-mom washes bedding, Wednesday-mom remakes bed, Tyler sleeps in bed and pees. (Oddly enough he doesn't seem to wet the bed when he sleeps with us...bet Freud would love to analyze that.) Thursday- you get the picture. My daughter has decided that instead of learning to walk, there is much more joy to be had in imitating a falling tree when a grown-up type stands you up on your feet. It's cute, but I don't think it counts as progress. My Pastor still has his job, and troublemakers aforementioned have found other churches to upheave. Don't think it's over yet, after all it is deep-rooted in the eternal good vs. evil battle. I saw "The Passion of the Christ", and there are no words... the closest I can come to describing it is saying that it reaffirmed my faith, emphasized my sinful nature, and magnified my gratitude for Salvation through Jesus Christ. The dryer that was replaced with my Frigidaire dryer about a year ago was finally removed from my garage. We intended to sell it, but never told anyone. Wonder why there were no takers. So in Sunday school a few weeks ago, I mentioned I had a dryer and of anyone knew someone who needed one, they could have it for free if they would just come get the stinkin' thing. So someone finally did. Yay!!!
To Redheaded Muse: Where you are in life right now is never as important as where you will be going. Tomorrow, next year, and eternally. I've always believed this and it comes with bittersweet realization. If you know a better tomorrow awaits you, you will no doubt be restless and looking for a door to knock on. Restlessness is a dangerous thing. I know because I go there every Monday. I want you to know something. Your ability to affect people far outweighs your ability sell insurance. (No offense.) You have affected me in ways you'll never know. Months ago, my eyes opened to the purpose that I'm meant for. I admitted to myself that I have always known that I am supposed to be a writer. It's something that my dad has told me since I could remember, but it did not become a reality until I prayed fervently about my purpose in this life. Shortly after that, I recognized that my first course of action was to start writing again. Something. Anything. It didn't matter if anyone would ever read it. Then, in casual happenstance, you led me here, to this blog. You affected the biggest change in my life to date - the one where I write. Almost every day, from the heart, I am exercising what I hope will someday be my profession. For years, I've had characters living inside of my head (not surprising, knowing me, huh) just dying to have me pour out their lives on paper. You helped me realize that I could do that. The fact that you read my blog inspires me, because if anything I write strikes a chord in your heart, then I am where I need to be - right? I'll consider you my first fan, and dedicate all of my books to you. Back to my point. (Yes, there is one.) I know you're searching. And frustrated. I can relate. If your calling is to affect others, than what seems like a career choice is really only a one-right-answer question. Paycut? Yeah, well, enough has been said about life on commission. Personally I think the only choice you have to make is whether you want to give this job your all realizing the potential to help, or do you want to focus your efforts on the little people in that classroom. Either one presents plenty of situations for you to spread around mercy. I think you are at the point where I was months ago - ready to admit what you are, what you are made of - but afraid that admitting it and surrendering to that purpose will lead you down a path you're not sure you're ready for. My advice, take it or leave it, is to jump on that path with everything you've got. And we'll share our journey of getting to the better days ahead.
I've been catching up on many other things since returning from my business trip to Phoenix last week. So having just finished the dishes (which were few considering my husband did the unthinkable and cleaned my house from top to bottom while I was gone) and decided to sit and put a few thoughts together. The first is that I seriously thought my plane was not going to make it home. It was wobbly taking off and continued to bump, thump and grunt all the way home to El Paso. It may have been my imagination, but I could've swore I saw the fusilage constricting and shifting in the wind. UHhhh.... SCARY!!!!! The meeting in Phoenix (I think technically we were in Tempe) was one of the best uses of meeting time I have had with Horace Mann. I think it is second to the Ameritas training course I went to in Lincoln, Nebraska a few years ago. There are those meetings that, for whatever reason, seem like a bad dream that you can't wake up from. And then there are the ones that have immeasurable value, where you meet people and get ideas that will help you in your own success. It's not really a wonder that the people at this meeting seemed full of wisdom and good ideas, they are for the most part our company's top producers. I was the only agent in the state of NM that was chosen to attend, which might sound special but truly there are only like ten agents and almost all of them are newer than me. So I got there by default, if you will. Anyway, the point of the meeting was a rollout of new software that stands to shift Horace Mann from an order-taking insurance agency into a full-fledged financial planning necessity for teachers. As usual at Horace Mann meetings, I tried to grow out of my shell a little and meet new people. With this group, the more I got to know them, the more intimidated I was. They were all wonderful people, but it just seemed like their agencies and their business numbers are just light-years ahead of mine. I'm a little stubborn, though, so the intimidation is feeding a healthy competition in my work ethic to be better . Work harder. Whatever it takes. Along with my new burning desire to succeed and my lack of current excuses not to, I have done much pondering about God's plan for the people that come into and out of our lives. I started thinking about all of the people I have met in my life that left a mark, for better or for worse, but I would not be the person I am without that mark. Growing up as a military brat really conditioned me to 'make friends as I go', I guess. I thought about Heather, my first true best friend and how we lost contact somewhere around the 7th grade but I can still see us playing in her yard in Germany, and I can remember what her handwriting looked like when we were pen pals for countless years before more moves for both of us left us lost. I think about Jennifer a lot, who is still a person of great influence in my life, and has been since the 5th grade. We never lost contact, and I don't think we ever will. She's always there in the background of my head with the silly "Wind Beneath My Wings" theme song from beaches illustrating the sisterly love that binds us for life. And there are so many more. There was Corey, my first boyfriend who loved me then hated me then loved me again. And then hated me. But I think when I left Italy he loved me again. He was a mess. He's probably dead or in jail by now. And then there's the EX, who's name shall not even be mentioned, who for lack of a better explanation was that 'first love' experience that you just HAVE to get out of the way so you can figure out for yourself what true, real love is. I pulled my scrap book out from when I was at the University of Florida last night. I had made such good friends with a handful of people there, and as I said - I don't know where they are today - they left their mark. There was Jon, James (James 2, as we referred to him to distinguish him from my then fiance, James), Jeff, Jackie, Katrina and Leanna. James and Jon are electrical engineers somewhere, I'm sure - James is probably in a relationship with a needy female, Jeff is probably making lots of money and still dating, that is unless he finally got back together with Jackie, who was his regretful ex-girlfriend. Katrina probably flunked out of school as she was on academic probation when I left and about an inch away from jail for writing bad checks. We should take a moment to pray for her.... Jon... Jon looked like the guy from Will and Grace that is a flaming homosexual and was always equally as funny (without being quite so 'gay'). Leanna's probably in Dallas raising a family and working, as she and I were a lot alike and that's where she was from. There's a lot more people I could talk about, but memory lane is no doubt entertaining only to those who built the road. What is my point? Hmm... a point. Let's see if I can get to it. People come and go. They loved you when you didn't love them back, and when you loved them, they didn't love you. They were the girls you loved to hate that became your best friends, or the girls that no one liked that became your closest confidantes. As we go along in life we get to choose who is actually a part of our lives and who we will allow to leave only their marks, and let them go. The best people we come in contact with are the ones that make us appreciate our choices in life, make us realize the equity we have in our already-built relationships, and the memory of them is happy even if it is fleeting. These people - the great ones - often blow into and out of our lives like fall winds blow the leaves... And whether you're on a plane that seems like it's going to be blown straight into the ground at any moment or just going about your daily things- it's good to appreciate everything you have, and to realize that there will be people here and there that will come into your life and rearrange just a little bit of you - but always hopefully for the better.
Whew... here's reason #867 why I don't qualify for the "Mom of the Year" award. As you may know, I've been saving up for future therapy for Tyler in conjunction with his college fund. He'll really need it now. Our local animal shelter has a fostering program in which you can take an animal home "for trial". In some serious lapse of good judgement yesterday, James and I went to look for a puppy that would fit into our household. We were looking for one that would turn out to be sort of small as our last domestic pet was supposed to be a Labrador Retriever but was in fact a HORSE. Tyler was scared of him and Mackenzie was an infant and needless to say, even if we owned several of the back yards on our street, it wouldn't have been enough for the Lab on Steroids. Not to mention no one was having fun picking up dog-horse droppings. Before that (several years ago), we purchased a Dalmation from a guy who was leaving to go overseas. We named him Magic, after basketball great Magic Johnson. Which was appropriate considering this dog could scale anything - cinderblock, chainlink, barbed wire - and the electric fence didn't even phase him. So after receiving a citation on my door one summer afternoon for "Dalmation at Large- chasing cars - pick canine up at the pound within three days..." (No we did not AT THAT TIME consider leaving him there...) we gave him to a teenage kid who could hopefully give him whatever it was that we weren't that lead him to escape our 'compound' daily . What were we thinking yesterday? I don't know. I think my judgement was altered due to forced lack of caffeine. We explained to Tyler that we were just trying it out, to see if we were ready to handle another family member. The puppy whined all night long unless I held him, and though it was cute, sometime around 4am, I really regretted the 'let's surprise the kid with a puppy' decision. By the time James got home from work, I had made up my mind that we weren't ready yet. We took the little guy back today. I feel like the BIGGEST LOSER MOM EVER. Tyler seems to understand, and I explained several times that his behavior tells me that he's not ready for a dog (we explained to him yesterday that he would have to help - pick up his toys, feed the dog, take him outside, etc.). After a few hours yesterday, the luster wore off and Tyler didn't want to do any of the 'work' associated with having a pet. He really didn't become too attached, and even suggested last night when the puppy was crying incessantly that he missed his brothers and sisters and that we should take him back. All of this notwithstanding, I feel like a heel! Who does that? Who get their kids a dog and takes it back the next day??? James was all for the decision, and I know it is best in the long run. We did promise Tyler we would keep looking for a puppy - the perfect one - and to "bribe" him, we took him to the fish store and bought him a soft-shell turtle for the pond he and Grandpa just built. He seemed quite intrigued that we had to buy little feeder goldfish, and was a little morbid on the way to grandpa's house, telling the fishies that the turtle (which by the way resembles a burnt pancake with legs and a snout; very strange) was going to eat them. He seems okay and I know he'll forget all about it. That is until his therapist hypnotizes him and brings out that all his troubles are because mom brought home a puppy and took it back the next day. Yikes.
I just had to add that on Sunday, we sang a song in childrens church called "Trading My Sorrows". It's an upbeat song and the course has a line that goes "Yes, Lord, Yes, Lord, yes, yes, Lord..." I caught Tyler singing it while we are at luch after church. Except he was singing, "yes, no, yes, no, yes, yes, no..." Sometimes I wonder how much we unknowingly confuse our children with fuzzy semantics.
On the outside my church seems healthy. Happy. Growing. I had 21 children in grades 1-4 children's church last Sunday. Debbie had around 15 or 18 preschoolers in her class. That's the most children I can recall ever seeing in church in the last 5 or 6 years. Oh, but haven't you heard? Our Pastor, Pastor Charles Hanks - he's doing it all wrong. Just when I thought that all had quieted down and maybe the mayhem had left the building, I went to my small group ( another 'horrible' idea ) only to find that yet again we find ourselves int he midst of a business meeting-turned-vendetta against the pastor. I am once again appalled at the mentors in our church and their mentality. But - I did some thinking and I know what they want. They want a pretty pastor to stand up there and say what they want, and do what they want. (Not that Charles isn't 'pretty', per se.) The want a puppet, or a Muppet. And from what I hear about how some members dislike the services, I've come to think they'd rather have a dead guy standing up there at the alter. AH! But they have missed the point, you see. Because someone did die, and though He's not standing at the alter preaching to us Himself, He cared enough to send the very best. I believe that is what Charles is - and Charles is there as a teacher, a man of God with a heart for God. He's building an army in our church and I guess that means making allies and making enemies. I know which I side I want to be on when I answer to God. And those who cannot see this reality are blind because the devil is standing behind them with his very claws over their eyes, encouraging them to take their best shot at the Pastor as if he were a pinata. The human part of me steams at the thought of people that miss the point. But my soul knows that evil grows only because Charles and Brian and Jesse and Jim are a threat. Apparently a BIG threat. My prayers are that evil will not prevail, that the pain caused to these individuals as if they weren't even human be taken away by the loving God they are working so hard for. No one should have to put up with the treatment that a few members seem to feel is their right to inflict as a member of this church. It's these people, the people that are being blinded by evil in the form of political agendas and power struggles, that we need to pray for the most. Because, you see, they are missing the point.
There are those days when I feel like I can do it all, and very well at that. Today was one of those days. My kids were both up and dressed by 8:30 and at grandmas by 8:45. This is quite the accomplishment because usually when they do get to grandma's that early, they aren't dressed yet. I would say that this is from the pure joy that grandma gets out of dressing them, but really it's due to poor mommy planning on my part, usually. Anyway, they were both dressed! - and out the door before 9am. Then, I did my usual - took care of about 30 people's insurance needs in the next 4 or 5 hours. Yay! I actually got CAUGHT up on my workload, which is a huge center of accomplishment for me. I was forced to do it, though, because I am moving into a new office and I VOWED to not move in my current state of catastrophic chaos. So, it was done. By 3 pm I had moved everything business-related out of my house and into my office by myself with a throbbing lack-of-caffeine headache, purchased a new desk for my office, convinced my overworked and tired husband to join me (yeah right) in building it at my office, and went grocery shopping. After the damage was done at Wal-Mart, I helped a five year-old load a cap-gun while unloading groceries and put a one-year-old to bed. I think sitting down to write this is the first 'break' I've had all day - and it's 1am!!!! And I am still semi-coherent! It's days like these that really make me smile, and even laugh a little, because I feel like I accomplished SO much, but then I look around at 5 or 6 piles of laundry I need to do, at the day-old Mackenzie-rejected food stuck to the kitchen floor, and I wrinkle my nose at the strange smell coming from Tyler's bathroom and think about where I should start tomorrow. SuperMom's work is truly never done. And SuperMom's kryptonite must be bleach 'cause she's a lousy housekeeper.
I had to call the cops today. For the DUMBEST reason possible. Okay, follow me here. Me and Mackenzie dropped Tyler and James off at Tae Kwon Doe. James had been driving, and his keys were in the ignition (he did not take them with him). Mackenzie was fussy and I had given her my keys before I took over the wheel. I was supposed to be running home to get something and then coming back to pick up Tyler and James. When I got home, I pulled in the garage and left the car running, a/c on, and I was only going to be a second. As I was coming back to the Tahoe, I hear a familiar short beep of the horn several times and think to myself "awe, she found the lock button on the keys!" A DUH! She locked herself in with my keys, the only other existing set in the running ignition! Now, if you want to get the police to your house in a hurry, call and report a baby locked in your car. They were there in a jiffy! Of course, I was considerate and called the non-emergency line and explained that she was okay and in the shade with the a/c on, but they still came a-runnin'. There was a locksmith right behind the officer and he popped the lock and didn't even charge me. He said, "kids are free!"... which was a great relief considering my humiliation and self-inflicted bad-parent complex attack. The funny thing was, the 10 minutes or less that she was locked in the car, she thought it was hilarious. When the officer arrived, he peeked in at her and she smile real big. He reported back to the station that "the baby is 10-4". I thought that was cute. What's the 10-code for spoiled rotten????
All of my life I have had what I have recently identified as PVCs (Premature Ventricular Contractions) in my heart. They make it feel as if your heart does a flip-flop in your chest. There have been a few times in my life where I have experienced these in a more disturbing manner than others - the last few weeks, for example. When at their worst, they seem to give way to mild panic attacks (after all, feeling like your heart is going to explode does give you a sense of "impending doom" - which is a clinical 'symptom' of a panic attack. "Impending Doom!" - Like there should be a good low orchestral starting and a shadow of a man in a robe with a sickle behind you) and those seem to perpetuate the PVCs, or palpitations, as I have always refered to them. Interestingly enough, I went to go see a doctor about this. While I was waiting, a woman from church (whom I didn't know worked there) saw me in the lobby and came to speak to me. If you've been keeping up with my blog, you know that I don't believe in coincidences and that God routinely sends ordinary people to comfort and save us every day. This lady's name was Madeleine, and I have my fair share of reserved opinions about her. Regardless, she took the time to ask me what I was there for. When I explained to her what I was feeling, she mentioned a few things that made sense. Like that anything from hormonal imbalances to vitamin supplements can cause these heart weirdnesses and panic attacks. We had a good conversation about the fragility of a woman's hormonal system and how anything out of whack can lead to depression, panic attacks, sleeplessness and the like. I can't remember everything she said, but I know that in a moment when I really needed someone to tell me they understood, she was there. After my visit with the Dr., I was further assured that my heart seems to be healthy, but was further recommended to a cardiologist to rule out any major problems. After making the appointment (for next Monday) I looked up everything I could on the net about my problem. I was comforted to see that LOTS of people have these things, that they are usually benign, and that LOTS of people seem to have them more severely than I do. Some people posted on heart health boards that they experience these flip-flops of the heart with every other heart beat or every third heart beat for days or weeks in a row. I can't even imagine how tiring and consuming that must be. A common thread seems to run through - I noticed a lot of the people with symptoms either are very active (or atheletes), and/or they have been treated for or have problems with hormones and/or depression. I don't consider myself very active, but I do know that I have low progesterone. I don't need a PhD to know that I have a very good clue about what makes this happen in me. After I visit the cardiologist, who will most likely recommend that I wear a monitor to record the events, I will be calling my OB/GYN to do a full workup of my hormones and thyroid. After that, if it's just stress, I guess I'll learn how to deal. My point is, when these 'attacks' happen, it is so hard to feel normal. It's like I am teeter-tottering on the edge of insanity, and as much as I try to talk myself into normalcy, the panic feeling still exists. I know that the panic attacks are most likely seperate from the PVCs, and most likely caused by my reaction to having more than a few PVC's in a day's time. As with everything else in life, I've lifted this up to God - praying for relief and to stay sane when it feels like my sanity is beyond my reach. Also, after speaking with Madeleine, I quit taking the vitamin supplements I was taking. In the last three days, the palpitations have lessened quite a bit. I did have a mild panick attack last night, but I'm hoping that was related to the 'decompressing' from being wound up so tight about these things all week. It was more like I knew that if I would just go to sleep, everything would feel better in the morning. And it did.
I care what you think! Not about me or your job or the current president... but I do care what you think about you and your blogging intentions. So you go girl. Let it all hang out. Who care who reads it? Who cares who cares? Those of us that truly love you know what to take from it. I have to say though, as a die-hard Republican... are you implying that the Clinton Administration had NO play whatsoever in the anti-terrorism actions in question? That idiot doing the questioning couldn't even remember that he was talking to Condeleesa Rice. PUH-lease. I think your caffeine intake may be affecting your political views. :) I love you anyway.
I've stewed about this blog for 24 hours, now. Because I'm afraid my rambling about reality shows borders on obsessive/compulsive. Obviously I'm watching them. And then ranting and raving about them. Which makes me no better than the people that truly ARE entertained by the sickening phenomenon of reality TV. The show in question: THE SWAN. Is it me, or is it like a really big secret that a woman's self-confidence palys the biggest role in bringing out her beauty? If you were not unfortunate enough to have your life taken over for one hour last night by this train-wreck of a t.v. show, let me fill you in. Two women. Not ugly nor fat by normal (if normal existed) standards. "Average", they call themselves. Neither of them in need of plastic surgery. Both of them in definite need of serious confidence-building relationships. One was married, the other had a boyfriend. So it's not like either was a desperate hag looking for a date. Here's the clencher. They both had EXTENSIVE plastic surgery, dental work, grueling physical work outs and diets and ("ahem") counseling for three months. At the end of the three months, some obscure panel of judges gets to choose one to continue on to compete in "The Swan" pageant. Okay, so we are going to take two women who are already on a fast-track path to self destruction, tell them both that just by changing what they look like on the outside we are going to solve ALL of their problems ("... All I want is WORLD PEACE.") A nip here, tuck there, and after it all, we're still going to give one of you the boot. Ce' La Vie. Don't let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya. How wrong is this? How detrimental to society is it that we are going to PROFIT from women who undoubtedly are familiar with Prozac already? Because how unstable and self-hating would you have to be to even be interested in signing up for this kind of self-torture? How socially irresponsible!!!! (You can actually see the steam coming from my ears, can't you?) Somebody should start a reality TV boycott. Maybe it should be me. But then again, Friends is ending and there's nothing else to watch on TV. UGH.
I am SOOOOOOOOOOOO happy!!! I finally was able to take the next step in growing a business... I signed a one-year lease on an office space yesterday. As soon as the deal was done, a huge weight came off of my shoulders. For almost three years now I've been in a constant inner struggle that has just about made me crazy. It's hard to explain to someone whose livelihood has never involved working at your own pace, on your own hours, in your own home. And even though all of these things are true advantages, there is a certain amount of stress involved when there is no one around to tell you that you may lose your job over the two hours you waste several days a week watching reruns of Dawson's Creek when you should be out selling SELLING selling!!! Very often my rationale would include that I'm doing just fine and more often than not I stay up until the wee hours of the morning doing paperwork or filing. NOW, I wll have no excuses. I get to keep the freedom, but can also make my life a little more normal by actually having "business hours". Instead of feeling obligated to work because my computer and all of my work is in my "home office", I can now work like normal people do. I'm really looking forward to this change, and my husband's support for it really makes it even that much more exciting. (It's taken a few good arguments for my wonderful spouse to come around to the notion that I have a REAL job, even though I am home a lot or can do what I want with my day.) SO.... In praise of my God that blesses me more than I deserve on a daily basis... Because really and truly all that's happening here is that my prayers are being answered faithfully by Him. I wouldn't attribute too much of the success I have had in the last three years to my own efforts. The right people and the right situations seem to enter my life at the right moment all the time, and this is more than mere coincidence. On the spiritual thanks note, a friend and colleague of mine was recently baptized in the Christian faith. I think she was baptized as a child, but has recently gone through struggles and has made new commitments in her life. This is the single most important event in our lives, because it takes care of eternity for us. (The becoming saved part, for which baptism is a public proclaimation that you've made the choice to live your life for Him, instead of for you.) For her, if you are the praying kind (I know my readers are growing!!! ) please keep her in your prayers.
Every once in a while you hear a song that just fits your life like your most comfortable old sweatshirt. This one's from Kenny Chesney, and I like it particularly because if you read the album jacket, you'll find the song is talking about a full-time mom, not a career-woman. Just that one job alone can be so overwhelming... throw in an actual part-time or 9-5 and you really know what the woman in this song feels like! BUT... all in all it's about getting everything you want in life and still remembering to stop and let the person you love uncomplicate it for you every once in a while. So to my husband... who says just the right thing more often than he knows... Woman With You She hit the door 6:55, sack full of groceries split down the side. Canned goods scattered all the way to the curb, Look on her face saying 'don't say a word'. So, it's me and her and a can of beans, sitting there on the front porch swing. Western sky all turning red, Head on my shoulder, she sighed and said: Been go-for'n, chaufferin', company chairman, Coffee maker, Copy repairman, Anymore there ain't nothin' I swear, man, that I don't do. Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals, Dancing backwards in high heels- Just when it feels like I can't make it through. She said 'it sure is nice to just be the woman with you'. She said the girl I was with the business degree probably wouldn't recognize me. I was gonna run the bank, I was gonna run the mile, Now all I want to run is a bubble bath. Back then you know I had this plan, Before all of this reality set in. Here comes life, boy, ready or not, Hey, I wanted it all and that's what I got- Been go-for'n, chaufferin', company chairman, Coffee maker, Copy repairman, Anymore there ain't nothin' I swear, man, that I don't do. Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals, Dancing backwards in high heels- Just when it feels like I can't make it through. She said 'it sure is nice to just be the woman with you'
You know, sometimes the days you dread the most turn out to be the best. I stressed in my last blog about Thursday, and here's how it turned out. I got to see a beautiful sunrise as I drove over the mountains to Hobbs. Which is unusual for me becuase I'm not a "sunrise" kind of person - I'm usually still asleep. My client was really nice, and there was a misunderstanding. She's interested still in the deal and now I don't feel so nervous about it because I gave it my best shot. As they say, the ball is now in her court, and I'm not so stressed over it knowing that I presented what I could. That's all I can do. Then, my next three appointments were in Carlsbad and all of them were the nicest people. That's got to be one of the best brightest spots of my job, getting to meet some really incredible people along the way. Then, my drive home was uneventful, which is good. It's never an interesting thing to see Bambi grazing on the shoulder out of the corner of your eye or react with a jerk when Thumper crosses the road. It's a long way to go, as it usually is. But it was well worth it...
I need to quit my dayjob. I was just sitting here thinking. I have a huge case to sell tomorrow, and I hate that I have pinned so much hope to it. It's only natural when something big comes your way to think about the possibilities and the financial ramifications it has in your life. It is, in fact, impossible to think about just the benefits the client receives. And I hate that. I hate that I have prayed about it, and as much as I have prayed that only God's will be done in the situation, some small part of me is thinking of the bargain - 'if only this goes through - I'll do this, I'll do that...' And all I was thinking tonight is how this isn't me. I don't want to sell insurance. I want to sell books - by virtue of people liking what I write and who I am and the characters that I'll live through in black and white. I hate thinking- knowing- that if tomorrow's deal closes, I'll be that much closer to being out of debt and that much closer to creating a financial situation where I can take more risks as a full-time writer, and reap more rewards as a full-time mother. Maybe it sounds lazy, I don't really care. I want to be home with my kids. I don't want to feel like I need a maid to keep up with my housekeeping. But I don't want to pin my hopes and dreams to clients and the decisions they make. I don't LIKE my job. I like the flexibility of it, the perks, the way I work, but who am I kidding? I like to think I help people, and I believe that in most instances I do, but it's not the kind of help that truly makes a difference in a person's life. I can show people how to save for retirement, but if they didn't I can't bail them out and promise them they won't have to be a greeter at Wal-Mart until they die. I can talk about products and services and coverages in my sleep, but I can't save people from being crippled in accidents or from having to deal with the aweful evil that is claims adjusting. Maybe it's a little melodramatic. I should be thankful that I have a job that offers opportunities to make large sums of money should a client decide they want to go ahead with something. But people who can walk away at the end of the day and shut the door in their brain until tomorrow are perhaps a little more blessed in terms of work-related stress. I wish I'd just win the lottery... but I suppose for that to happen I'd need to buy a ticket.
This is my first fictional blog entry. It was inspired by a visit to my great-grandfather when we were home for vacation in March. I want to expand it and send it to a literary magazine, urlLink Glimmer Train Press , at the end of the summer when they are accepting new stories for standard submission from new writers. Your comments are welcome and appreciated. Dear Warden: You stand there at the end of the hall, staring at me tirelessly. Judging me. Sizing me up. Your quiet stare antagonizes my fighting nature, wakes up the rabid Rottweiler that lies quietly sleeping in the hearts of all good men. My blood begins to boil and once again, I find this pen my only means of communication to you. I'm innocent. I've told you before, and I'll tell you again. I did nothing to deserve these walls or this constant vigil over me. Innocent? I can hear your laughter. And I want to yell at you - I want to scream, "I want my life back!" at the top of my lungs. But my voice doesn't cooperate, and it would be a futile effort. You must have learned in your experience to react to nothing a prisoner says or does. After all a reaction would mean that there's a connection, a human connection between me and you. And connection means emotion, and a man of your stature is no doubt denied the luxury of emotion. I'm pleading for my life, dear Sir. My wife comes to visit me here, and I can no longer bear the tears that glisten on her cheeks. She says we'll be together again soon, and she waits. That's my Dot - she always was like that one little patch of bright green grass that breaks through the toughest asphalt man can lay down on a lonely desert road. No matter how many layers of tar they heap up on it, no matter how hot the days are or how frigid the nights are, that one little tuft of grass always breaks through. That's my wife. We made it through some tough times. And she doesn't complain, not even a little. I look down at my hands as I write you this letter, and I am surprised. they don't look like they belong to me- the hands of a self-made millionaire. The hands that once caressed gently the genuine leather of a brand new Cadillac every other year. The hands that built buildings and made good investments. They're old now, these hands - and I hold you personally responsible. You took away all there was for these hands, everything from my wife to my Caddy to the orange tree in my back yard. I can see in your eyes a certain type of pity. Not the type of pity where you feel sorry for someone. It's more like when your mathematics teacher explains to you how to work a problem and no matter what words he uses, you just can't see the solution. You must think I don't get it. That I'm in denial about my transgressions. Sure there were times that I could've done things differently. I could've been a little nicer to my family. A little less materialistic. I should've went to church willingly with my wife, which is an activity I have resolved to do once my freedom is returned to me. I suppose I could've cleaned up my mouth a little... all of these things, Dear Warden, they are my sins. But in what world do such crimes warrant a life sentence in a prison such as this? There was no trial, no justice for me. My daughter came to visit me the other day, and I fear she is ashamed of me. It is good to see her face, to have her hold my hand and help me to my chair, but every once in a while she gets the same look in her eye as you have - that indescribable pity. Sometimes I can see that her temper is short, that her worries are more than a father in prison. I can tell that she visits me out of obligation, an unspoken rule that children are supposed to reciprocate the care they received growing up. Perhaps that's my crime. I didn't love my children fiercely enough. I didn't take the time to get to know them, I didn't take time with them at all. I wasn't the father that brought home surprises tied with frilly little bows for my daughter. I wasn't the father that took his son fishing and camping every summer. But I had a business to run, I tell you! I was important! I was successful! Was... successful. I think Dot would agree, I don't feel like I've succeeded by landing a residency in these halls. And how shall a man measure his life's success? Your stare frustrates me, but the familiarity of it gives me peace. I know your place in this prison is to keep us from harming ourselves, and I respect that. I beg of you, Dear Warden, to hear my case in person. To speak with me, and tell me what my crime was, as you must know better than I. I'm innocent! I did nothing! My request today is that you hear my plea, and that you set me free immediately, so that I might reunite with my wife and make up for promises broken in the past. My plea is that you set me free so that my children are in turn set free of their obligation to me, as I can see now that I am a burden while in this prison. I beg of you, Dear Warden, for pardon. Signed Sincerely, Eugene Heart It was my first shift as a nurse in the Santa Maria Assisted Living Center, Alzheimer's Unit. I saw a man sitting in the hall, staring down one of the long hallways at a picture of Jesus on the wall. In his lap was a yellow legal pad and a blue crayon. "That's Eugene," said a voice from behind me. It was another nurse. I squinted to see her name emblazoned on her scrubs. "Claire...is it?," I said. "What's his story?" "Pretty much the same as all of 'em. He suffers from dementia and can hardly talk thanks to a battle with throat cancer a few years ago. His wife died about two years ago, and his family couldn't care for him any more. He hasn't really adjusted, and all he does is sit there and stare at that picture of Jesus. Oh, and he asks for pen and paper. 'Parchment' is what he calls it sometimes. Kinda cute. Oh, if you go by him and he asks for pen and paper, get it right away. Sometimes he goes into fits if he doesn't get it right away." "What's he writing?", I asked. "Nothing, as far as we can tell. Every once and a while there will be scribbles or a small picture, but nothing, really. And another thing, he may grab you as you go by. He'll rip a page off, fold it up really slowly, and tell you 'give to warden'. We think he may have done some time in prison when he was younger..."
urlLink That's what 80's toy I am. Ha! That's funny. It was my favorite 'toy' next to my purple Popple and my Viewmaster.
I can't even imagine a day in the life of a soldier... I can't imagine what it's like to know that all anyone can talk about is the mistreatment going on... I can only imagine, when that day comes - where there will be no war, no pain, no suffering, no CNN... As the song goes: I can only imagine, when that day comes - "Surrounded by Your Glory, what will my heart feel? Will I dance for You Jesus, or in awe of you be still? I can only imagine..." Some of us are closer to our final moments on earth than others, regardless of what is being fought for. Remember that.
So my poor little baby girl developed a bit of a rash 'down yonder'. Not to release TMI, I went to Wal-Mart to purchase some Desitin to relieve her of her painful buttocks condition. While looking at the ointment selection, I noticed a particular brand called (and I am NOT EVEN MAKING THIS UP) Butt-Paste. It was seriously called Bordeaux's Butt Paste for Infants. Now, there's a CEO who has a sense of humor and has had a kid with diaper rash. I couldn't keep myself from laughing out loud in the middle of Wal-Mart. I'm going to go to Edward Jones tomorrow and request to buy several hundreds of shares of the company that sells Butt Paste. Heh.... Butt-Paste.... :)
I'm pretty proud of myself for figuring out how to add pictures and comments to my blog. And my Kudos to Blogger.com as they made both options much more dummy-friendly than they were before. If you read my blog, can you please PLEASE post a comment to me on this or a previous post, so I can know that it works. I believe you just click on the little 'comment' on the bottom. Don't be afraid or shy. I'd actually like to get a comment from everyone that reads it as I have lost track of how many people I have given it to. And BTW, the following picture doesn't really have significance, it's just the ambiguous filename I picked from the file library. In case you wondered, that is James' dad and step-mom, Joy, out in Arkansas - with Tyler and Mackenzie and the dog is a Great Dane named Jazz.

In the ninth grade I had a huge crush on a guy named Nate Powers. He was the cutest thing. All of my friends knew I liked him, and I think maybe we would've hooked up if he hadn't have left Italy at the end of that year. Not the point. That summer, my bored and so-called friends decided to have a little fun at my expense. I worked at the Fleet Post Office as a summer hire and they got the 'adults' that worked there to agree to make it look as if a package had arrived for me from my beloved Nate Powers. Of course, being about 14 and ignoring the finer evidence such as there was no way Nate would've known my address, I was ecstatic to think that he had remembered me after all. When I opened the box, it was a brick with a note attached that said, "Ha! We got you! Love, Aubrey, Meagan, Antonio and Deanna." Yeah, thanks. Alas, I never received anything from Nate Powers. And eventually I moved on. It is hard to find the joke funny when your heart thinks something is sincere. Which is what I was thinking about tonight as I watched the WB's mockery of American Idol, in which they are turning down good singers and passing through those that have no talent. Practical jokes are one thing. But breaking someone's heart isn't really funny and I think it's disgusting that these networks are making a dollar at the expense of someone's feelings. What is funny or even interesting about telling someone that has no vocal talent that they do, just to tell them in the end it was a show about finding the worst voice in the USA? Why are these networks building people up just to tear them down? If my child was on this show, I'd be raising hell. Because if there's one thing I won't tolerate in the life of my children it is for their hearts to be broken in this manner. For them to be set up, duped, played - and by people whose only motives are money and ratings. I can't bear to think of having to help my children through real heartbreaks- first loves, losing friends or relatives, not making it on the team or losing the big game - why WHY why WHY are there people out there that are setting these things up? Isn't there enough heartache in the world without us having to create more for viewing pleasure? Please PLEASE stop the insanity!!!!!! (I'm sending this to the WB)
One of the earliest series I can remember Charles teaching was the Wednesday night Bible study on the book of James. I can remember Charles teaching us that if we weren't going into, coming out of, or smack-dab in the middle of a trial, we ought to be concerned, because "the testing of your faith develops perseverence. Perseverence must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything" (James 1:3,4). If God's not working on you, it's a bad sign about where your life may be headed. It would be easy to focus on the negatives concerning the events leading up to Charles' resignation. It's very easy to place blame and very hard to keep my heart from hardening towards certain people and religion as an establishment in general. But the one most important thing I have learned from the Hanks family is that God's plan should never be underestimated. Through the Hanks family, many people have been witnessed to and many have been lead to a relationship with Jesus Christ that they had not known before. Their family will never know the true measure of their success in Alamogordo because there is no way for them to tell where or when their influence will cease, if ever. Through the Hanks family, many people have shown their true colors, and though the human reaction is to condemn, criticize and complain about these people, the Hanks family's behavior reminds us to pray for God's plan and that God's work be at the heart of all the church members say and do. When Charles resigned this evening, he looked more at-ease and happy than I have seen him look in a long time. I understand what it is like to make a decision that is the best for your life, that you prayed about and you know is God's will, but it still hurts. It's a trial, it's supposed to hurt. I thought I would feel heartache when the inevitable event of the Hanks family leaving us would come to pass, but I don't feel heartache at all. I am happy that God chose to grow the Hanks family here for a while. I firmly believe that everyone we come in contact with, no matter how briefly, is someone God put there for a purpose, to leave their mark. (Read a few blogs down.) Or maybe in Charles' case for us to leave our marks with him, to make him the Pastor that God wants him to be somewhere else. And I'm alright with that. It's all part of a bigger picture. Charles said in a sermon once that we, as a church had a choice to make. We had to grow or we were going to die. I think the church has made its choice. We can't grow without a pastor that has the kind of vision Charles does, and its obvious that they won't be looking for another Charles. So I've decided to see the church as I did my 80-some-odd year old great grandmother when she was nearing her final days. That sometimes death is what needs to happen to ease pain and let people grow. Someone said that leaving the church would be a mistake as all of the new Christians we have had join need to be ministered to. Let us not overestimate our roles in other people's lives - we are NOT responsible for their salvation. Witnessing, yes. we should be doing that anyway. As for the growth of new Christians, they need a shepherd, not a bunch of sheep telling them what they think is right. There's a reason not everyone is called to ministry - it is no doubt the most delicate of all professions. I fear for the new Christians in our church, and even for my own faith. Jesus talks about the church as a body, and I would consider the Pastor a vital organ, one without which the body cannot survive. It's useless to try to use your ministry gifts in a church that doesn't have a heartbeat. Hopefully soon we might witness that the death of a church gives new life to everyone that has had to stand through the trial. To Charles, Brenda, Chad, Cody and Clay: Thank you for all you have shown me, and for the work you have done here, and for the trials you've endured so gracefully. You are no doubt being prepared for bigger things, in God's name. Please stay in touch.
Just when you blog negatively about your husband, he does something that warrants a serious blogapology. James has been attending a Dale Carnegie class for the last 12 weeks. He's mostly moaned and groaned about having to go and been less than enthusiastic about the fact that his employer required his attendance at the class but also required him to pay half of the $1400 pricetag. But he still came home every Monday night talking about the people he was meeting and the stories they were telling. If you've never heard of Dale Carnegie, it's a self-improvement course for learning how to communicate more effectively with others. So anyway, in the last 12 weeks, James has stunned me several times with his newfound communication skills. Like several weeks ago when I brought up renting office space. We were having lunch together and the exact words out of his mouth were "I admire and respect what you do. I couldn't work out of the house; I'd get sidetracked watching ESPN all day." I wish I could have seen the look on my own face at those words, from the man whom I typically get what I want from, but not without a good prolonged knock-down, drag-out "my way makes more sense" kind of fight. He is the conservative in our relationship. He worries about the bills. He has reservations about spending money to make it. So that conversation that day at the Waffle House was a great milestone for him, because he continued to tell me he could see the value in renting office space and even though he would no doubt worry a little bit, he knew it is what I needed. Wow. But it gets better. He wanted me and Rhonda (his twin sister) to come to his graduation session. All of the class participants had to get up and talk about a defining incident from the class and their vision for their future. All of them got up and spoke about what a difference a little communication skill had made in their personal and professional lives. James got up and talked about a defining moment at work, where he realized the value of the principle of backing up what you say with evidence. How if someone did a good job, tell them why you like what they did. He said he felt he has always been good at showing support, but he has learned the value of telling people something uplifting to them, not just saying 'thanks'. So, in the car on the way home, we got to talking about the class - all of the people, what he learned, what it all meant to him. He had said in his talk that his point was if you love someone, tell them why. If you like what someone's done, tell them why. He piqued my interest by saying he was going to talk about me, but at the last minute he didn't think he could without being too emotional. (He is NOT an emotional kind of guy.) I asked him to tell me, and he looked at me the way he did several years ago when we were dating - the look of 'I'm going to say something you might consider cheezy, and I'm embarassed to say it'. We had gotten out of the car to pick the kids up and he gave me a great big hug and said, "You always ask me how much I love you, not why I love you. You're my rock. My everything. You gave me two beautiful kids. You're my reason." (I'm crying!!) Now, I have known for years that my husband's love language is in the way he takes care of me and the kids. It's how he jokes with me and how he acts like I'm driving him crazy. It's how he usually tells other people nice things about me more than he really tells me nice things. There's never been a doubt in my mind that he loves me. Every once in a while, he'll say something and catch me completely off-guard. But he has never, ever, in 8 years, told me why he loves me. It occurred to me that I never really had a need to know 'why', but hearing him say those words was like standing in my very own chick-flick, starring me. I suppose I may never hear him open up like that again, and that's okay. It wouldn't mean as much to me if he said things like that every day. So I guess I should thank good ol' Dale Carnegie for teaching my husband how to say the things that matter.
For James' birthday, which was on the 7th (he's officially 32!), one of his best friends and I conspired to surprise him by flying said friend in for the weekend. So I went to El Paso and picked up Shawn on Friday, and brought him home. Shawn walked into the house first and my mom and I could hear him say "What's up, BITCH!" to James, and heard a surprised expression though we missed the look on his face. And this was just the beginning of the boyish regression. On Saturday, I had a wedding shower to go to. I left my kids in their father's more-than-capable hands, for only like 2 hours. I left at 4, and when I came back at about 6:30, Tyler was in the backyard half covered with mud and Mackenzie was sleeping. James and Shawn were playing Madden 2004 or some crap like that on the playstation. Here's the ensuing conversation: Me: "Where's my kids?" James pauses the game and looks around, as if the question is a little complex. "Tyler's either outside or in his room and Mackenzie's in bed." Me: "Why is Mackenzie in bed? It's only 6:30." James: "She was really fussy, so I thought she was tired. I just put her down like half an hour ago. She cried a little but now she's quiet." Me: "Did you feed her dinner?" Stunned silence. James: "Dinner? I thought you fed her." Me: (ANGRILY) "I left at four! She was probably hungry! I can't believe you didn't feed her!!!!! (Insert harsh line about taking responsibility or something) The insert two hours of subtle steaming from the bout of parental incompetence my husband displayed. Good thing his friend was in our company or I would have really went off on him. So here's my theory. When I was 17 and James was 23 and we started dating, our maturity levels matched. Somewhere around his 28th birthday I think I surpassed him, and he is now in a state of 30's regression aggravated by the presence of other regressingly mature male species. Sometimes, it's like I have three kids. Gotta love it though, as his boyish faux pas keep me laughing (after I get over the anger.)
My fault for LOL at my sister-in-laws blog about a wasp thing on steroids invading her home. Last night, while I was minding my business doing laundry, I look down and see this HUGE brown spider. I go get a shoe, then think, "no, too big a mess". So I opt for the slow and no doubt more painful death-by-bugspray. As the thing is curling up in the corner, I go outside to get take the top off the hot tub, which I was happily going to sit in and read and pray that the 103 temp would soothe all the muscles I can't move right now BECAUSE I TOOK A STEP CLASS AT 530 IN THE MORNING on Tuesday. Pain- it's how you know you're still alive. Which is good because I barely remember taking the class as my brain functions at about 10% that early in the morning. And I hear I'm going again tomorrow. Anyway, back from the diversion..... As I step outside, I notice something crawling in the space between the hot-tub and the house. Sure enough, it's a nice-sized black widow, just a'spinnin'... (Hey maybe I should try the spinning class at the gym....) Because of its size and obvious markings, I thought it may be pregnant and was not up for tousands of teeny tiny black widows running all over the place so I grabbed the bug spray once again. Later I scooped them into a dust pan and left them out where James could see them. Evidence. Habeus Corpus. Please, please, please , honey - I begged him. If there's anything you do tomorrow, will you call the Bug Lady?????? She's a long-time friend of ours and I don't know what it is she uses but after she sprays, the bugs that don't turn up dead officially organize a march to the house next door. Good for them.
I have a new theory. It is that when my son starts sleeping like a normal person (or abnormally sleeping like a teenager) is certainly going to be about the same time that my daughter will turn in her angel-wings as the family's easiest sleeper and become the night-stalker that runs in her blood. My theory is, they can't help it. Someone made a comment in Sunday school about how kids don't sleep; they recharge . No statement has ever been truer, and my 5-year-old only needs about 20 minutes in the car on the way home to be ready for the next 12 hours. And by the way, if you think your kids are playing nice and quiet, and you think it is because you're an awesome mother and you've got great kids, think again. They might just be playing in the toilet. Tyler: "But Mom, I flushed it first!"
Rumor has it that the Pastor is leaving. I don't know if it's true, but I suppose it's just a matter of time before the geriatrics get their way anyway. I'm so mad I can't even blog about it right now. Half the church is probably ecstatic about the rumor and the other half (majority) that supported him are probably going to be mad at him for "abandoning" us. If I were him, I'd jump ship, too. Apparently he missed the part of his job description on the application that requires him to be perfect to be a pastor at a little church in the middle of nowhere, New Mexico. UGHHHHH.

I have to share how my husband and I spent our 7 year wedding anniversary, which was today. Don't worry, it doesn't even breach a 'G' rating. First of all, we both thought it was yesterday. We knew it was the 28th (or so he admits), but we both thought the 28th was yesterday instead of today. Thinking it was on Sunday as of all last week, he took me out to lunch on Friday and we rented a movie to watch that night- "Eurotrip" (which was funny but not nearly as funny as its predecessor RoadTrip). So anyway, having celebrated our anniversary 'early', I really didn't expect a whole lot today. James calls me at around 3 and asks me where all of our credit cards are. We're trying to get our debt under control, and we both (though he won't admit it) have a nasty habit of putting the cards up and saying we won't use them only to go get them out of their hiding places (like seriously we hide them from ourselves) to use them for things that shouldn't be charged in the first place. So when I tell him that I froze them, he's silent. He thought I meant that I called all the companies and closed the accounts or something. What I really did was stick them in a plastic cup of water and put the cup in the freezer, which I read is an effective way to quit using your cards without actually destroying them - they still exist but aren't exactly accessible unless you get desparate and break out the hair dryer. I said, "No, you dork. I FROZE them. Literally. They're in the freezer. In ICE. FROZEN." He said, "Quit talkin' to me like I'm dumb. I can't believe you froze them. Guess you aren't getting flowers." So I proceeded to tell him very seriously that I didn't need flowers, he had already spent money on me and if he really felt he had to get me something, just pick me up a bag of M's. (That is all most women really want, anyway, right? Just hand over the chocolate and no one gets hurt.) I came home from work, and while dealing with a cranky and getting-sick Mackenzie and a Tyler that turned all my metal bowls upside down on the kitchen floor and pounded on them with my GOOD wooden spoon until it broke, I made James lasagna for dinner. When he got home, he had seven red roses for me, a bag of M's and a card. The funny thing is, he doesn't read my blog. (It would have to have a score ticker or a play of the day on it to keep his attention long enough to read it!) But the card he got me says on the front, " '...This is my beloved, and this is my friend...' - Song of Solomon 5:16 " (I love Song of Solomon!) Then on the inside, left it says "God left no detail to chance. He planned it all for His purpose. - The Purpose Driven Life" Which I know he knows I love 'Purpose driven Life', but it was always sort of one of those things that I thought I rambled on about and he just listened out of obligation. On the inside right it says - "I'm so glad God brought us together, and that He knew long before we did that we would share our lives with each other. You are His gift to me, and I will always be grateful. Happy Anniversary. Signed, Love Always, James." (Sigh!) This from the guy that isn't really very good at self expression unless the wrong team is winning the game. When we first started dating (almost nine years ago!) he would give me these really romantic cards and gifts all the time, then of course for a while I ragged on him about not showing the love enough. Now, all I ask for is a bag of M's and I get more than I wanted or expected. I guess some women want to get flowers all the time (they're probably the ones that don't have a reason to put their plastic in the freezer), and for a while when I was younger I thought that was how a man was supposed to show a woman how he felt. Now I guess it means more that the card he got me references one of my favorite books and one of my favorite verses and tells me that after seven years, after one miscarriage, one banged up car, countless fights about money, a few borderline major screwups and two beautiful kids, we're still friends. I couldn't ask for more.
There's two things Tyler said today that had me cracking up. The first one was when he was talking to me, and I don't remember the whole conversation, but in proper context, he says, "I bend you parting?" I said, "what?" He repeats, "I bend your parting- you know what you say when you want someone to repeat what they said?" I say, "Oh, you mean, 'beg your pardon'?" He says, "Yeah, that's what I said. Bend your parting." It was cute. But not as cute as the peanuts thing. Over the past few weeks I have had to do some basic explaining about (to the extent of my knowledge) male anatomy. I tried to tell Tyler that calling the male 'privates' by their proper name is nothing to be ashamed or embarassed about and we talked about 'appropriateness'. Ahem... so while Tyler was getting out of the tub tonight, I heard him yelling down the hall, "No sniffing the peanuts! No sniffing the peanuts!!" I walked down the hall to see what was going on and sure enough he was swatting at the dog who was trying to lick him. Peanuts? Close enough, I guess. Ah... out of the mouths of babes.
urlLink Me and Mackenzie urlLink So I was trying to use this as my profile picture but apparently the file is too big.
Redhead muse... I miss your blog! If you start a new one I promise not to alert the old flame... elections are coming so I have to have someone to educate me on the finer points of being a democrat. Agency NM... where is your blog? I'm tellin' ya, you could use the therapy. Also, you and Dan know more about me than I know about you, and that's just not fair. You could turn my research questions into a blog all your own. Yeah, I'm talkin' to you too, Dan. I haven't come up with a disguise name for you, but I'm thinking of Dan the Master of Impaired Expert Navigation. You may not even recall why, but that'll be the fun in it. Devon- Okay. I'm trying to get my kids to eat more natural foods and I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT. The best I seem to get is hotdogs and bananas, with jello fruitsnacks. And then there's always the ever-present easy access to chicken McNuggets. Thank goodness McDonald's now sells apple slices, though I am sure there are six tons of preservatives in them. I imagine unless I learn how to slaughter my own cows and grow my own potatoes, eating more naturally just isn't going to happen here. What's the name of that book you are reading? I'll FedEx you some milk. I'm so happy you are having another one... you're the best mom ever. To my uncle- if you are still reading this, I'm still working on it. I still have questions for you but I really need to get my act together. Hey, we were watching COPS last night and they were in Jacksonville. Mom and dad kept trying to watch out for people they know, especially Lynn or Robbie. (They were showing the VICE squad at work, so you never know...) To James- 7 years and counting...
like the new look????? Thanks to Blogger for ceating better templates.
I've been cleaning my house for like two days straight now. It's not that it's that dirty or anything, I think it's me. If you add together the two children, the husband and the dog, I'm picking up after an average of 7.5 people. (Here's the math: children under 2 qualify as 2 people. Husbands qualify as 3 for obvious reasons. People ages 2 to 10 qualify as 3 but get a 2 person discount because they HAVE THE ABILITY to clean up after themselves if a large enough reward is offered. All dogs count as 1 but have a .5 surcharge if they shed. Makes sense now, doesn't it?) That's an army in some parts of the world. I would say I'm sadly outnumbered. Then there's the refrigerator incident. (Just one of the multitudes of reasons husbands qualify for 3 people) My wonderful spouse did me a favor and cleaned out the refrigerator several days ago. I was really proud. Being that we're busy and eat out a lot, a few dishes had accumulated in the sink and as shameful as it is to admit, sometimes I do the dishes just like once a week. Anyhoo, James forgets to mention that some of the items he removed from the refrigerator were deposited as is in their containers in the sink, hidden beneath a plate and a sippy cup. I did the dishes yesterday and came across the foulest smelling think-it-used-to-be-salad thing I've ever encountered. So I did what anyone would do, I held my breath and poured the mess down the garbage disposal. Then I turned it on, followed it up with baking soda and some ice, which is supposed to (According to Heloise) make it so the disposal doesn't get stinky. I rinsed the dish out, washed it with soap and water and stuck it in the dishwasher for the sanitizing power of ultra-hot water. This is a great story so far, isn't it? I finish loading the dishwasher and turn it on, using the last drop of detergent I had. When the thing gets on it's drying cycle, I walk in the kitchen and smell the same old salad nastiness wafting from the vent on the front of the dishwasher. The dishes are clean, but the air in there smells like 3-month old lettuce and milk. YUCK. I don't really know what to do to get that smell out of my dishwasher, other than turn it back on again. And again. And again, this time with baking soda. Over two days I have washed that load of dishes six times. I think the smell is finally gone. And the dishes are clean. So anyway, it's been two days of nonstop cleaning, organizing, and restarting the dishwasher. I was up until about 3 am last night ironing clothes and mopping the kitchen floor. Oh, and washing peed-on bedclothes. You can't get mad at the little ones for wetting the bed, but I have washed peed-on stuff EVERY DAY!!!! And FYI, for little boys, those pull-ups or Goodnites don't work. They don't leak, but apparently they can be missed , which is sort of odd, but I'm not a boy so whatever. Now I feel like I have a Lysol hangover. And I should be working not blogging.
... I bet it sucks! If someone is willing to publish urlLink The Devil and Barry Manilow , then certainly someone will be willing to publish my unwritten insurance fraud thriller about the young insurance agent that thwarts even the most devious insurance fraud plots, like the roofing company that goes around town telling unsuspecting clients that they have 'a little hail damage', so if you call your insurance company, the roof you were going to replace anyway will only cost you your deductible. Ay caramba! But seriously, things like this give me hope. Now if I would just actually write something.
Okay, so it may be fairly unchristian of me, but I have never really been able to get myself to feel sorry for the Iraqi prisoners. Now they've decapitated two of our civilians, people who were over there serving other purposes rather than to die for their country, and we're still supposed to feel sorry for humiliated Iraqi prisoners. Uh-uh. Eye for an eye they say.... that's their thing, isn't it? Not that I'm against human rights, but if the photographs taken of the prisoners by Americans saved even one soldier's life, it was well worth it and as American voting public, I'd ask them to do it again. War isn't supposed to be quaint, and I can only imagine the soldier's point of view. Yes, we humiliated them. They publicly decapitated two Americans. There's no contest. They win the bad taste award. Too bad their choice of public assasination won't affect an election for them.
My husband's boss's daughter got married today. And whoa, I'm glad ours wasn't the only fiasco. These people will have some good stories to tell, like how they had the reheasal 'barbeque' at white sands and everyone and everything got blown away. (AGH, sand in my contacts!!!) And memories of my wedding cake melting in the humid Florida summer. To my kids: Please ELOPE!!!!!!!!!
I'm a traveling companion along with my sis-in-law for the two winners of our local preliminary Miss America pageant. It's for Miss Alamogordo and Miss Otero County (herein referred to as Miss A and Miss O). Of course, these two go on to compete in Miss New Mexico, and then Miss New Mexico gets about 1.5 minutes of airtime on the nationally televised Miss America Pageant. As a traveling companion (TC, as we are lazy enough to name it), we take Miss A and Miss O to several local events throughout the year and then are responsible for being a mom-like figure during Pageant Week leading up to Miss NM. SOOOOOOO.... That's what I was doing all last week and consequently had no time to blog. However, the urge has become to strong so here I go. Ten reasons why I'd rather be a TC than a contestant... 10. There's this thing called a goodie bag that Rhonda brings to everything. Chocolate, Pringles, Snack Mix, you name it. The difference: I don't have to worry about what I'll look like on stage in my swimsuit after I eat 3 Rice Krispy treats and half a can of Pringles. 9. Those fake boobs they sell on late night info-mercials? Yeah, every pageant girl has a set. And they DO come off when you sweat. 8. If you really want to play the game, you have to hire Michael the unlicensed hairdresser from Albuquerque who was obviously exposed to way too much aerosol as a child because HE looks more like a girl than I do and wears the makeup to prove it. Some swear he's not gay but there are flame detectors going off all around him. However, you too can let Michael turn you into Pageant Vomit for a mere $1000 bucks a week. 7. Butt-spray. 6. Have you ever had your boobs taped together? Or had to tape some poor girl's boobs together? Not fun for anyone involved. 5. A pageant is completely subjective, and sometimes it's obvious that the jugdes are really those deaf, dumb and blind monkeys. 4. TC's never have to act nice to wolves disguised as girls in capris. We can just ignore them. 3. We don't have to sing, dance or play the piano. Or draw our own hands or do magic tricks twirl a baton. 2. The lifestyle and fitness portion really is just a "how good you look in your bikini contest". Let's face it. If they wanted to really judge lifestyle and fitness they'd be at the track timing laps and in the gym counting reps. Whatever. 1. Losing. I became very attached to our girls this year and it BROKE MY HEART when neither one of them made the tp ten. we expected at least one to make the top five or win talent, neither of which happened. So the number one reason it's better to be a TC is that it SUCKS to lose!!!! Those girls give that pageant everything they've got and it is aweful when it is obvious that its more about politics than real talent. And I'm not biased. Our girl has the lead role in Evita here and was touted by many as being the best talent in the pageant, especially by other professional performers. BUT no, the judges saw to it that one of the agreed worst talents won the talent contest. AGHAGHAGHHHHHHHH! There you go. Don't you just want to run right out and join your local pageant's board. You should. It's a good cause and ultimately the girls get life skills out of it that they could learn no where else, and normally they will walk away with a small scholarship just for competing.
I went to a meeting tonight at church that was an explanation of an intentional interim program for our church to consider in light of the recent vacancy left by Pastor Hanks' resignation. I was expecting to feel better about our church and its future, but I feel worse. The explanation of the program, which calls for a "rediscovery" of the church's vision and goals, poses a few obvious questions for me. The first is that while Pastor Hanks was here, the church came closer to have a vision and a direction than I have ever seen it. I can't figure out how people can sit there and say for the last three years, there has been lack of organiziation, direction and leadership. Though no leader is perfect, and a fatal flaw of being wet behind the ears (as Charles was when he came to us) is that you have to try a few things out and see what works. Of COURSE a pastor with 28 years of experience isn't going to have the same type of organizational challenges that Charles had. On the other hand, Charles had a vision, and a direction, and the God given gift to show that to others and set them on fire for God, too. So, I don't think searching ourselves for our goals and a vision for the church is a remedy for the problem at hand. The plan also calls for (what I now consider a four-letter word) committee of about 16 to be the 'transition team', to evaluate the by-laws, goals and vision of the church and rearrange them to suit the church body and make it easier to hire a new pastor. I don't see it happening. I can just about guarantee that the 16 people chosen to fulfill this job will not represent what the younger generation wants. It is a church that doesn't want to change. I believe the rift between the two groups of people in the congregation is so deep and so wide and so treacherous that no human being can bridge the gap. Thus, we have to rely on God to build the bridge... and I can't imagine the judgement He must be placing on the people who want to form a committee and take a vote before they'll accept God's plan for the bridge. I can pray for healing to take place, but I can also see clearly that the gap was started generations ago and that it might be several generations from now before the decendants of First Baptist Church come to a realization that God built that church, not their grandma or grandpa who came to Alamogordo way back when and by golly that church wouldn't be there if she/he hadn't tithed fatihfully 10% of gross , not net. I've said it before in this blog, and I'll say it again. Sometimes the best prayer, the one that gives us most peace, is the prayer for death to finally come - in the form of mercy. I think that this church HAS to die to be born again. I think it has to weather a serious hardship for the people involved to be reminded of what is truly important in God's church. I cannot see that in the next year and just by virtue of this program that all the old arguments will be settled and that everyone will finally love what is going on at First Baptist Church. It's hard to not feel like I have a church home, but it's even harder to watch this 'rebuilding' being condoned by the church body when I feel like we DID have a vision - we WERE growing- Charles was doing a great job to a majority of the people. So he left and now it is like we are starting from scratch and undoing everything he did - and for all that his family went through and all the sacrifices he must have made with his family and in his personal life - I can't support that.
So yesterday, while sitting in the car waiting for something (I don't recall what or whom), Tyler says, "You're a mediocre mom." (He was referring to the lines in "Bruce Almighty" which we had watched earlier that day, where Bruce is yelling about not being happy with mediocrity.) Before the tears welled up, I said, "Tyler, do you even know what 'mediocre' means?" (Remember, he is only FIVE.) He said no, he didn't. I explained what it meant. I said it means not really great or outstanding, but not bad either. Just average. Then I did what no mom should. "Do you still think I'm a mediocre mom?" He said, "yep." Then he said, "well, you're a little better than mediocre." Hmm. Wonder what he'll think when he's ten.
So I had my wisdom teeth pulled today and was a little irritated that my wait to get them pulled was longer than the actual deed. I was feeling pretty comfy for a good 20 minutes while they pulled those suckers out, then they showed them to me and wowed over how perfect it was, they didn't even have to break them apart to get them out! (Yay?) So it all went well except for the one time I puked upon arriving home due to the medicine. I feel fine now and to be quite honest, I don't think I'm very doped up but my mouth isn't hurting the way I expected it to. Maybe thats because I'm so used to being in pain with those teeth and constantly biting my gums. So anyway, I guess if they truly are wisdom teeth then I am four times less wise as I was yesterday. Oh well. On a brighter note we saw Kenny Chesney and Uncle Kracker in concert the night before and it just might be one of the shiniest entertainment moments in my life ever when Kenny and Uncle Kracker sang (rapped) Kid Rock's 'Cowboy' (which I didn't know Uncle Kracker wrote). That rocked. Anyway - Mack's awake and seemingly nhappy so I must go for now.....
Kelly won Miss Alamogordo last night, and I couldn't be happier if she were my own daughter or sister! I prayed that she would win so I could have a year to really get to know her better (as the traveling companions take care of the girls, get them ready for Miss New Mexico next summer, etc.). The Miss O winner was a girl named Sonya who is also really nice and seems like someone we'll have a lot of fun with. I'm glad the week is over, it was horribly stressful and sometimes downright out of control.
Last year Kelly sang urlLink 'Seasons of Love' , from the Broadway hit, "Rent"- Five hundred, twenty five thousand, six hundred minutes- Five hundred twenty five thousand moments so dear, Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes- How do you measure, measure a year? In daylights, in sunsets? In midnights, in cups of coffee? In inches and miles? In laughter and strife? Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes, how do you measure a year in the life? How about love? Measure in loves, seasons of love... Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes Five hundred twenty five thousand journeys to plan... five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes - how do you measure the life of a woman or a man? In truths that she learned? Or times that he cried? In the bridges she burned, or the way that she died? It's time now to see that the story never ends, Let's celebrate, remember a year in the life of friends remember the love... Seasons of love I fell in love with the song and became instantly attached to the bright shining girl that is Kelly Mohr last year. She has one of those personalities that just beams, and you can't even hate her for being so gorgeous. This year Kelly came back to the pageant, armed with experience from last year and ready to win. I hadn't really seen her much since last year, since her mom sent her to Colorado to live with an aunt to get her away from a mentally and potentially physically abusive boyfriend. That seemed to have worked, and this year Kelly seems a little bit stronger and a little bit wiser. This year, though, I have become even more attached to her, helping her develop her interviewing skills and just connecting about life in general. Kelly learned on Tuesday that she has urlLink Wegeners Disease , which is a rare but potentially fatal disease. It's an autoimmune disease in which one's white blood cells attack small blood vessels all over the body. She's lost all of the cartilage in her nose (she doesn't look any different) which is usually the first area deteriorated by the body. It can attack any system of the body, causing blindness, deafness, heart or liver failure. The cause is unknown and there is no known cure other than to put it into remission through steroids and chemo-type treatments. Prognosis is good if it can be kept under control, though flare ups occur in half of all patients and your chances of having this disease are pretty much worse than your chances of winning the lottery. I've talked to Kelly's mom, who has just recently completed treatments for breast cancer, and she seems to be more aware of the long-term implications of the disease (as I have become since researching it). I'm still coming to conclusions but I think the way I feel about Kelly since hearing the news is that she's blessed. Not because of the disease, but because just like any one else, she's not guaranteed a tomorrow. Her advantage is that she hopefully won't waste her young adult years trying to convince the world she's indestructible - as most of us do in those years. Maybe she'll know God sooner, if she doesn't know Him now. When I look at Kelly now, I think about the irony that exists in the fact that she looks so healthy and is absolutely beautiful. I pray for her mom and know how she must feel like she would do anything to take this on for Kelly. I think about how blessed I am, how grateful I am that I'm not afraid of dying nor am I afraid to watch my friend die - and the only thing I fear is that we don't live . It's ironic that the song that makes me think of her every time I hear will now also remind me of just how precious every moment really is, not because of the song, but because of her. I don't think she's had the time this week to contemplate the years ahead, but I think she's strong enough to fight it head-on once she realizes what it is. I can't imagine being told at 17 that your life isn't going to be what you thought it was and that it might be a lot shorter than you'd have guessed. I feel helpless to do anything for her. I'm not sure what to say to her, other than to let her know I'm here for her if she needs anything. I am really praying that she wins one of the local titles tomorrow night so that Rhonda and I will have a year to be with her and help her through her first year with this disease. I'll always rememebr that on Monday night, when she finished rehearsing "It's Raining Men" (her song for this year), all the girls and moms shouted at her to sing Seasons of Love. She sang the first few verses acapella, and there was not another sound in the building except for her voice. It was beautiful. That was the day before she was dealt a tricky hand in life.
Really, what good is it going to do anybody to shack Martha up for 5 months??? Wouldn't it be a better punishment to just fine her the amount of money she gained (or saved herself from losing) by her little 'trade' and then have her pay all the court fees plus interest for the time spent that the American public has had to hear about this crap? I mean really, it's not like she killed someone. You know, like O.J. And whatever 'prison' she goes to, aren't they going to treat her like she's at a spa?? "Here's your mimosa, Ms. Stewart." Please. All that her sentencing will do is provide lots of late night t.v. jokes that will no doubt get old quickly.
I've been stewing in the ashes of burnout!!! I don't know why, I'll guess its hormonal, but I really just haven't had the desire to do much of anything lately but have still managed to be busier than a one-legged man in a ... well, you know. The isolation of being the only person representing my company in a 400-square mile chunk of New Mexico can be really daunting, but I have a new best friend!!! I recently met with the guy who took over my account at the radio station, and believe me, I'm a small beans account. But this guy is awesome, and does an EXCELLENT job of making me feel like my account IS important! He has really lifted my sprits about my business and is helping me brainstorm about marketing things I can do in the future. It is nice to finally have someone in town that can be a marketing sounding board and actually knows a lot about what works. So thanks to Beau for helping me work myself out of my rut!!! James and I went to dinner with Beau and his beautiful girlfriend, Tiffany (who is an old friend of James' from high school!) last night and had a good time just getting to know each other. I've said it before and I say it a lot more- God sends people into our lives at the precise moment we need them and I really think that Beau coming to the radio station and replacing Laura is just another act of divine intervention in my life, because the future's looking quite a bit brighter. Once again, my thanks to my God that blesses me even though I don't deserve it - and puts people in my life to help me along the way at every turn. Hopefully in some way I am just as helpful in someone else's life as other people are in mine.
We went to the pool on base yesterday. They have a neat slide that is sort of the "main attraction", but isn't nearly as cool as the slides at a real waterpark. Nevertheless, it's pretty high and fast and has always been Tyler's biggest fear. Everytime we go to the pool, we ask him if he's ready to try the slide. He always says "no" right away and we pretty much leave him alone about it, knowing his psyche is scarred due to an incident at Fiesta Texas where we took him on a ride that we swore wasn't scary - it was one of the big slides with a reaft that you fit like six people in. There was only me and James and my dad and Tyler in it, so it was pretty light (considering) and it flew down the slides, nearly toppling over in all of the turns. We're pretty sure that's where the fear of slides comes from. So anyway, I asked him yesterday if he wanted to just go to the top of the tower and watch other people go down. He wanted to do that, so we got up there and I started working on him to get him to go down. Grampa saw the progress I had made by just getting Tyler to the top, and he told Tyler if he went down three times, he would buy him a paintball gun. (Just ignore the warning on the package that says ages 11+). Agh. So, Tyler's want for a paintball gun was greater than his fear of the slide. After he went down once, of course, he wanted to go down repeatedly and found it quite fun. He even said "Thanks for taking me down the slide, Mom." We went straight to WalMart where grandpa purchased a paintball gun and paintballs, which we took back to GRANDPA's house and shot at the fence (and birds). So I think this one might win me a spot in the bad mom hall of fame, being that my five year old really isn't old enough to own much less fire a paintball gun, ride a motorcycle or own a TV/VCR, but he does. I'm gonna say it's not completely my fault. I mean it doesn't really make sense that he is not afraid to ride a motocross bike on his own but he's afraid to ride the puny little slide at the pool. It's grandpa's fault. At least I can say my son isn't a sissy! And that bribery thing works fairly well, unfortunately.
I read my sis-in-laws webjournal and thought it was funny how she commented on blogging unfairly about all the new cute things her daughter is doing and less about her son, Trevor. The difference between our boy and our girl is night and day. I love my kids equally, mind you, but there's just something special about our little girls. For instance, Mackenzie has had an earache since Friday and the meds upset her tummy. So she woke up at about 4:30 this morning, and after I changed her I went to put her back in her crib, and she leaned away from it and started shaking her head "no" and pointing toward the door. Now, she's eighteen months old and I don't really remember my son being quite so animated and vocal about his feelings, nor do I recall feeling like he understood anything I said but "no, no!". So I laid her in bed next to me (she normally doesn't mind her crib, unlike our other need-to-cosleep child) and told her to go back night-night. I guess she wasn't too tired because she just chatted and played with her feet. Being used to talking to Tyler in bed instead o f her, I thought it was really funny when I got irritated by her jabbering and moving and pronounced "Do you want to go back to your own bed?" She shook her head "no". She totally understood, because I said, "Then be quiet and still and go back to sleep." About fifteen minutes later she smacked me in the face, so I scooped her up, gave her a big hug and took her back to her crib. She squealed defiantly for about two minutes then was out until about 9:30. I was just really amazed though at the way she interacts with me for as young as she is. But that whole sugar and spice and everything nice is true if you consider the "spice" part to be jabanero pepper juice - because I sure have got one heck of a firecracker on my hands. She's not going to be afraid to express herself... wonder where she gets that?????
It's been a busy week. I registered Tyler for Kindergarten on Wednesday. This event was highly emotional for me. I suppose its because it makes me feel like we're just a few PTA meetings short of middle age. And I told James it's like this huge realization that we'll never have another little baby again (unless God steps in and thinks we should be blessed with a failure of tubal ligation which will probably happen the day Mackenzie graduates from high school and would probably be twins. God's sense of humor....). Buying his school supplies in Wal Mart was just as emotional. It's like I can feel that every year now is going to be marked by school days and holidays and the years are going to fly by even more quickly than they are now. It's silly, I know. When I dreamed of having a family long ago, I never quite pictured myself the mom of teenagers or even ten-year-olds. I guess when you want kids you think of them as babies because they stay that way for such a while. But now it's like there will never be any more first birthdays or first tooths or first steps. I guess I just didn't really think about it that much until I signed Tyler up for school. Geez, I'll probably have to be checked into a looney bin when Mackenzie goes to school. Yikes.

I was talkin to an old friend name Phillip on the computer and well he got my cell phone number one night and called and I didnt answer but Amber did and she started talkin to him....and I was like ok whatever..and they really started talkin and talked for like...5 hours that night..and then the next night he called and they talked and we had a crazy idea for Phillip to come meet Amber and visit me b/c I havent seen him in like 1 or 2 years...So he is like ok ill come but imma bring some friends along with me and I was like ok thats cool...So we like put on some clothes and got ready***its like 2 in the mornin*** and so they call and are like we are here..so we go right down the road from my house and there are 4 guys there... it wassss.....phillip...harold....daniel...and Cory.....well as soon as we got there Amber was like omg they are losers lets go..and I was like nooo..lets wait...that Cory guy is cute I want to talk to him...so she is like...ok....so we sit there a lil while and its starts to rain...so Amber and I were like we are going in..So we start goin in and Phillip pulls in my driveway and was like we cant go right now...there is 4 ppl in this truck and one is in the back adn its rainin..so the nice person I am I let them come on my porch...and I go out there for a while...and from the time I went in and came back out Cory had told Phillip he thought I was cute...and well so happens that I told Phillip the same thing...Sooo we are all just sittin there and they are like this is boring..and I bring up the stupid Idea to go to the damn motorhome**which I am not even allowed in** so they are like lets go...and i said it was locked so they go get in somehow.. and we all go out there except this one dude...he was drawing graphette...the dude that didnt come in there got on my nerves anyways...lol....so we all go hang out in the motorhome..and its call cool and stuff.....we had lots of fun... then it was startin to be daylight and I didnt want to get in trouble for having people over so we were sayin bye and all and Cory and Phillip decide to ask us to go out on a picnic the day after that..so we were all excited and I got Cory's # and we talked and well we started really liking each other and then we did that whole picnic thing.. Amber and I went to huntsville probably 20 times throughout the next month or so... I mean I thought I was really fallin for him...I got to go stay the night with him and everything!! Well then Amber and I went to Panama City for a week...It was fun and I didnt cheat on him....believe it or not!! It was hard but I didnt!! We did all kinda of things in Florida.. we ate at Dirty Dick's and everything :P So when we came back I missed Cory sooo much so I called and was like....hey and the first thing he said was "I miss you!!" and I was like I miss you too....can I come see u now...and he was like yea so Amber and I went up there the first night we were back home...I got to spend like 4 hours with him!! And it was sooooo great the whole time I was in his arms and he was tellin me how much he missed me!! Then we went home at like 2 in the mornin!! Then the next day I didnt get to see him I think I had to work or something I dont really remember that... Then the next day I got to see him again but it was only for like 2 hours but I guess those 2 hours are gonna have to last for a long time :'(( ....not going into detail there....long story... But I miss him and I know he knows it :( But anyways...before I get all sad.... More about the whole Florida thing... the first day we were there we got there at like probably 5....I unpacked all my bags and put all my clothes in drawers and everything..in like 15 minutes!! Then I think I went out to the beach...It was soooo pretty....We went to the beach alot... We went out to fancy resterants like 3 nights... we went to Dirty Dick's .....Capt. Anderson's and...black angus....They were alll really exspensive!! We went to The Strip Amusement Park...It is the last summer it will be there too!! that sucks it was fun!! We spent alot of the nights sittin on the beach til like 3 in the mornin. It was really nice.. our hotel was extremely nice...its one of those resorts where they do everything for you...like house keeping and take ur bags up and u get ur food brought up and everything...lol...but yea..the last night we were there was cool...we met alotta people and we hung out.....we didnt go to sleep that last night we were there..we jsut decided to sleep the whole way home!! It was allllll great!! On the way home it kinda sucked...we got stuck in traffic for I think it was 3 or 4 hours!! As soon as we got home I went ahead and unpacked all my shit and washed every thing!!I was soo tired and just ready to drop dead...but as soon as I knew I could go see Cory I just some how regained all that...lol!! But yea that was pretty much my whole summer tonight is my last night of summer and actually it is over now....its after 12...so its officially a school night once again~~ Well imma go...talk to you later!
Tuesday night was spent with my former roommates Mimi and Margarita and Margarita's boyfriend Paul, who was a part-time roommate over my two years at UCSC. The four of us and our other part time roommate over winter quarter, my dear friend Bri, ate at my favorite restaurant The Saturn Cafe. The Saturn Cafe was out of rootbeer (it is always out of something) so Margarita and I decided to order Dr. Becker, which is an organic non-caffeinated version of Dr. Pepper..so we thought, how much different could it be? and we ordered it...Well, let me tell you...it was god-awful...it tasted like carbonated cough syrup to me...Margarita made the better comparison to a watered down slurpee with coke added to it...that's coca-cola, not cocaine to any of you sniffers or gum rubbers out there...in any case it was sent back and we each got a RC cola which I typically do not care for, but having the taste of Dr. Putrid in my mouth, the RC cola wasn't so bad.After dinner and one drink (well I had two) at the fancy place Shadow Brook where Bri's boyfriend Roger works we left Margarita to her work on her thesis and left Bri and Roger to their sleeping or some form there of..and Mimi, Paul, and I went to the Red Room for a couple more drinks. We sat at the bar and ordered our drinks and the 40 year old man sitting next to me talking on his cell phone smiled and then finished his conversation outside...when the man came back he asked what I was up to tonight...I said having some drinks with my friends, indicating Mimi and Paul. Mimi said hello and introduced herself and then Paul did the same following with, "and this is my sister Shannon". And so the lies begin.The man's name is Seisel...yes, you read that correctly....Seisel...in my mind he was named seasalt. After our introduction Paul asked randomly, "Hey Shannon, what is the color of Arby's?""Arby's? The roast beef place?" I respond."Yeah.""Um...brown and yellow?" I venture."What's this all about?" asked seasalt in his feminine voice.Paul repeats his question to the condiment."brown and yellow" seasalt replies, unoriginally I might add."No" Paul says, "brown and orange""Oh" I say, wondering why we are even talking about this. And then suddenly I was reminded of the time, the one and only time I have been to Arby's. I was with my not so likeable neighbor Meagan and her not so likeable mother Gail. I was seven, and I had to pee...and the restrooms cost a quarter to open...and Gail wouldn't give me a quarter, so I had to hold it and it was terrible. And that story reminded me of the time when I was little and I couldn't pronounce my "r"s and so instead of girl I would say guhl...and whenever I saw Gail she would squawk "say girl, say girl" to which I responded with "guhl" and then she would laugh at me and I would go home crying. Imagine, a grown woman laughing at a little girl...stupid bitch (I love how initially instead of typing "stupid bitch" I was thinking of typing "how insecure she must have been" but I like stupid bitch better)And now back to the story at hand.Then seasalt asks me, "do you work at Arby's?""Yes" I say."Oh, okay""I actually don't". seasalt opens his thin lipped mouth in mock surprise, "you lied to me.""No I didn't, I was just trying it on. I wanted to see what it would be like to say that I worked at Arby's, I didn't like how it fit... so I didn't lie to you, not really...on a side note my brother Paul is a chef at a restaurant in Pacific Grove"."Oh really? I love to cook""Of course you do", I think, "you're a condiment". This started seasalt on a cooking tangent telling Paul all about his love for cooking...to which Paul could care less about.Then seasalt looks at me and says, "You have lovely shaped eyes""uh..thanks, that's a first" "No, they are lovely, a little sad, but lovely".I thought about saying, "yes, my best friend committed suicide two weeks ago, so um, yeah..I suppose they would be a bit sad, now wouldn't they?" But I didn't.He continued, "they are slightly almond shaped""Oh" I said, thinking, "don't people with down-sydrome have almond shaped eyes?" I thought about saying, "I am no downie, sir." But I didn't.Then I turned to face Mimi and she said, "I have never noticed the lovely shape of your eyes before"I smile and look at seasalt, he heard and then left shortly thereafter...and Mimi, Paul, and I laughed.
i fucking dont know what to do. Holly left me. she says we dont ever get to see eachother. its not my fault. the stuff that keeps me from seeing her is the stuff thats going to get me into college. I dont even know what to do. I told her it wasnt what i want. im just so... pissed of and sad and ... I dont even know what to do. Im just so frustrated. Screw it. now im just going to focus on my work. im not even gonna bother with anything else. because its not even worth it. she didnt even seem upset by it. Whatever. I dont even care. Well i do. but whatever. whatever... but as meghan said, everything happenes for a reason, which was verified when i got a 41 directly after it happened... its still shitty though mehh

ugh my life has been soooo busy lately and will continue to be so busy until well... school starts. Im doing the tupper park ad thing this year, as well as taking method acting classes with ted, helping leah pick out flowers on tuesday, spending every other weekend with my dad, trying to find time to spend with my friends and on top of all that, ive been sick for like ever. I havent been sleeping real well lately either. and even when i do sleep alright, osama bin kitty (bear) wont let me sleep past 745. he'll come into my room and sit on me and purr and rub against me until i push him off the bed two or three times. then he starts meowing and thats usually when i get up. damned cat. AND ive been having really weird dreams lately. all of them including people i dont normally think about on a day to day basis. some more funny than others, some more disturbing than others. but definatly symbolism in them. For half of the dream ill be walking around without glasses and i see what a normal person sees, the other half ill put on my glasses, representing clarity, and see ghosts and stuff. well, it either represents clarity, or that i want super powers. hmmm. im supposed to hang out with meg today which should be sooooo cool because i havent seen her since school ended. things have been up and down with holly lately, shes a party girl. shell have a few drinks (mind you i dont party) and call me at around 3 am on my cell phone and say things like "im so sorry im a bad gf" and theres those times where she just gets so drunk that she thinks im against her. ive asked her to stop drinking and shes promised, but i dont think shes stopped or is going to. i love her when she hasnt been drinking, and if i told my dad about this he'd flip, knowing him. so i dont know what to do. well yeah i do know what to do but.... right. okay. thats my life as of late, give me some feedback. bethy
I think when the school year actually begins in about three, four weeks I'm going to move this blog into a daily summary and analysis of teaching in an urban Texas ghetto. It might shape the direction of "Donna Martin Graduates." As for the DNC, a collection of thoughts: When my first child is in Kindegarten, his social studies curriculum will be highlighted by President Barack Obama. Was Kerry's speech really that rushed? Being a delegate in 2008 would be cool. I thought the unity and the speeches were all very good, but hey... isn't it the same political rhetoric I heard in 1992, 1996, and 2000? Do these speeches ever result in change? Why is it that all politicians try to shape their lives as common and meaningful to the average man, yet they're well-connected millionaires in reality? Wouldn't you love to see a dude who drove to Boston in a dusty pickup truck win the nomination? Does the GOP have an advantage by going second, and closer to Election Day? Seriously, this is what I don't understand. Bear in mind, this argument is going to make me sound stupid, and not credible to discuss said topics. If you watch CNN and see a set piece where a Republician and a Democrat are interviewed about the same issue, HONESTLY they say slight variations of the same general theme. If everyone wants America to succeed, why can't bipartanship flourish in various governmental organizations? Why can't anyone say "fuck the sides of the aisle, I want America to succeed" and then actually mean it? Ah, I'm naive...
I promised myself I wouldn't put a lot of links in this thing when I started it, but here goes nothing, regardless. Look at this link, from Fox 26 News in Houston: urlLink http://www.fox26.com/predator/HISD%20schools%20A.htm I work in that district. Do you know there's an entire blog dedicated to whether or not Jessica Simpson's breasts are real? A valid topic, without a doubt... but an entire blog? 20 "bloggers" got accredited for the DNC next week in Boston. It's really a shame I didn't start this thing earlier. Ah, pipe dreams. As for the DNC, I'd like to see an unified, coherent message emerge and Kerry bounce to the clear frontrunner before Bush's 9-11 showcase in late August. I think Kerry needs a 30 minute speech - maybe as low as 25 - that emphasizes his credentials without bashing them over the heads of unsuspecting midwestern viewers, while explaining why these credentials are uniquely suited (or, say, moreso uniquely suited) to guide our nation than Bush's corresponding credentials. I think he eventually needs to address the inherent disconnect of most Dem. nominees for President - how can you argue for the resolution of "two Americas" (Edwards' big thing) when, in fact, you're chillin and windsurfin' on Nantucket ("where the millionaires mow the lawns of the billionaires") over the weekend. Question of the Day Are Jessica Simpson's breasts real? (someone's gotta ask it)
I moved this weekend. The most significant (or significantly depressing) thing that I realized is, without cable or Internet hooked up, I really had nothing to do. I read like 12 magazines, which I suppose is good (and I know that Lenny Dysktra is running an upscale car wash, which is interesting), but man, this digital age has really captured our generation. Here's a good one. The Phillipines are pulling troops out of Iraq to avoid one of their citizens getting beheaded, right? It's drawing international ire, apparently. I honestly haven't been following it that closely, but I believe that to be right. What if Bush's daughter was captured by terrorists (one of them is trying to go to Africa, where I believe anit-US groups operate)? Would he pull out US troops for his daughter, or keep them in for his nation? I bet some movie has been made about that exact choice, and I probably didn't see it. Regardless, if you had a good script, it would be a kickass movie. Martha Stewart got sentenced to five months in prison for her insider trading deal. Don't you think white collar criminals ought to do a "Robin Hood" style thing, and give a larger chunk of their money to the poor? I mean, what does putting a white collar criminal in jail really do? I don't think it does anything, frankly. Meanwhile, there's a growing national divide between the "haves" and the "have nots" which could probably be somewhat (miniscule, I know) fixed by making rich crooks give their money to lower-income districts. Some guy on FOX News this weekend said regarding Farenheit 9/11, "If I wanted to see a fictional movie about a fat guy, I'd go to Shrek 2." I hate FOX News, but you gotta admit that's pretty funny. I think Kris Benson should go to the Mets, and Randy Johnson to the Red Sox. Meanwhile, no one's taking notice of Morris Peterson - on the verge of blossoming into a 20 ppg scorer - going to the already stacked New Orleans Hornets, who have an excellent coach coming aboard in Byron Scott. When are these NFL preview mags going to come out? Question of the Day Consider the President Bush scenario above. What would YOU do?
Has anyone ever stopped to think exactly what makes Paris Hilton a celebrity? Is it because she's rich, does dumb things, and involves herself with marginal celebs like Nick Carter and Lionel Richie's heroin addicted daughter? I don't really get it. In the same vein, why don't more people from reality shows become famous after the reality show ends? Johnny Fairplay from Survivor is in pro wrestling now, and one of those other Survivor girls is on The View, right? And Eric Nies hosted The Grind after Real World I in New York. But come on. If someone like Paris Hilton can demand that much attention from the press, can't Brad Fiorenzia from Real World San Diego get his own show on CNBC or something? I can't believe I just wrote that. I've become mildly obsessed with The Real World recently, since watching 11 San Diego episodes in one day. The only Real Worlds I've ever followed were NYC (#1), New Orleans, and San Diego. I feel like I missed a lot of popular culture moments, fleeting as they may have been. It's a shame, really. Diesel on the Heat. I wonder if they'll be good... and more specifically, I wonder how long until Pat Riley takes the urge to replace Stan Van. Ironic, because once Isisah takes over the Knicks, it'll be Riley vs. Thomas, which was once a prominent player vs. coach matchup in the late 1980s. Ah, things coming full-circle. Doesn't sports do that better than any other outlet? Why is Jessica Simpson famous? Because she's hot, because she married another hot young rich person, because she's a singer, or because she's dumb? Does anyone even really care that the NHL might get locked out? Hilary (sp?) Clinton's aides are pissed she's not getting a prime time spot at the DNC later this month (shit, in 2 weeks). That's probably because she's gunning for THE prime time spot at 2008 (did they pick a site for that yet?). Ah, Edwards vs. Clinton '08... the Iowa State Fair will never be the same, 'specially if you toss Evan Bayh in there. Question of the Day Behind the New York Times and (I think) The Washington Post, what's the best daily newspaper in America?
I watched the Home Run Derby on television last night, after contemplating (for about 11 seconds) going to Crawford Street downtown and trying to catch balls. I realized I didn't have cash to pay for parking, and nixed the idea, which ended up being a good thing when I saw unbridled mob violence on one of Tejada's dingers. And what the hell was the point of making that huge stage for the infield when Clay Walker did one song? Anyway, Lance Berkman had 42 HRs and 128 RBIs in 2002, but since that was before I moved here, and thus before I cared about the Astros (and read their daily beat writer summaries in the Chronicle, for lack of anything better to do when my girlfriend is studying for MCATs), I didn't know a lot about him. His performance last night, even in loss, was magical. He ripped like 6 in a row to left field at one point, making small elementary school children sprawl over trying to catch the ricochet. He's got 152 career HRs as of now, and he's like my age. I think he'll get 500. He should start batting from the right side of the plate more at home, although I don't know how well he'd hit righty against live pitching. Tony Pena was tossing heat, though - and high. Antonio McDyess on the Pistons. *Yawn* I read this article - letter to the editor - in the Chronicle last night where a mother criticized some social columnist for writing an article about the decline of American parenting. The woman went off on some tangent about how she took her 2 children to California to see relatives, and they visited all these amazing sights and read books together and shit. Good for you, lady. I really do applaud your attempt to broaden the horizons of your children, but the woman who wrote the initial article wasn't talking about you. The fact of the matter is, the ghetto has always been awful for parenting... it's hard to blame those parents, though. A lot of times, they don't have a role model for what good parenting should be, and honestly, they need to work to make money for food and rent, so they can't always be with their child. Still - and I know you can find a survey to prove anything (that's how I got through college) - there's countless surveys that the average time UPPER MIDDLE CLASS parents spend with their children is decreasing on an annual basis, probably down several percentage points from the early 1990s. Interesting, given the relative absence of this debate in the recent political spectrum. Honestly, do you know how many NYC parents hire babysitters so they can go out, on a 6/8 weekend nights a month basis? I'd argue being a good father is probably one of the most tangible accomplishments a man can record, and yet it can't really go on any resumes. Do you ever find it weird how people are generally obsessed with things happening at midnight? Midnight Madness? Now there's a new movie series where classic comedies play at Midnight followed by group discussions or some such. And then, there's Midnight Basketball making a comeback in large urban centers (another attempt to keep kids off the streets, probably of a futile nature). Also, the term "midnight" is used in countless book and film titles. People are really, really obsessed with it. I can't tell if it's just the word, the images it conjurs up, or the notion of darkened secrecy. Ron Reagan Jr. is speaking at Democratic National Convention, in prime time, about stem cell research. That's cool and all, but I bet Ah-Nold pops a bigger share / rating for the GOP in August with his prime time slot. Question of the Day Is chilvary (sp?) among American males truly dead?
So yesterday, I'm reading the Houston Chronicle Sunday edition, because the NY Times Sunday edition was sold out at the grocery store next to my girlfriend's apartment. The lead story on A1 is about America's presence in the Middle East (go figure) and this article is fairly long (who woulda thunk?) and continues onto like A26 or something. On the second page of the article, some US under-general says, "The roads are treacherous; there's bombs absolutely everywhere. These people have nothing to fight for, so they're just fighting to hurt us. There's no rhyme or reason to their strategy." (I'm paraphrasing, by the way... I don't really know if that was the exact quote, but that's the jist of it) Doesn't that seem like Vietnam to you? Let's see - a war halfway around the world that we don't necessarily need to be in, or, at the very least, don't need to be in ANYMORE... hmmmm.... Johnson was from Texas, right? And came to the Oval Office through odd means (that some would argue he arranged to happen... hell, some at Dealey Plaza argue that)? Bush is from Texas, right? And came to the Oval Office basically because the Supreme Court was full of people his father had appointed? Odd. America is a fuckin' odd place. Honestly, though, why are we still in Iraq? We've been hearing for months now that there's no connection between Iraq and Al-Qaeda, yet we've been hearing for years that Al-Qaeda masterminded 9/11. The thing is, now there's all this talk (headline on cnn.com) that Election Day might be postponed as a "Doomsday plan" or some shit... why? Because there's "intelligence" (vague, governmental buzzword) coming "from somewhere" that indicates Al-Qaeda might be planning something. Word, they might. You know how we could stop them? Address THEM instead of Iraq. Anyway, since I don't know that much about politics, I'm going to stop discussing politics at this juncture. Shaq on the Heat (if it happens) probably shifts the balance of power to the East, but the NBA Title is a race between the Spurs and the TWolves, with the Pistons, Pacers, and Heat slugging it out in the East. Get ready for this shit, though: the Nuggets ("Nuggs" to stoners) are going to get the 4 seed in the West, if not this year than next. Especially if they add K-Mart... you're looking at a 5 of Miller, Melo, Camby, NeNe, KMart... sure, doesn't SOUND like a lot, but believe me, they'll be good. Grizzlies haven't lost anyone, either. Expect them to only get better. Jessica Simpson is going to be Daisy Duke in "Dukes of Hazzard" movie, potentially with Ashton Kutcher and Paul Walker. WOW. That's all which can really be said. I watched about 11 minutes of "Ready to Rumble" last night on TBS late night. Extremely underrated film, if you enjoy films about professional wrestling. It's a notch above "No Holds Barred" and somewhere below "Beyond the Mat" (which I've never seen, but have heard is excellent). Question of the Day What would happen to society if lawyers and teachers switched salaries?
I hit up FanFest at the George R. Brown Convention Center today. Billed as a celebration of baseball, the several miles (I'm estimating square area) display features video batting cages and pitching matchups, Nolan Ryan telling parents how to involve their children in baseball, various guys from MLB Radio trying to answer MLB Trivia Questions (if you stump them, you win a shirt), and a bunch of other stuff. It was really cool; despite that generic description, I truly think it summarized a lot about professional sports today. Sports is another, newer form of religion for some: it brings together people to pray at a common altar, if you will. For example, you ever see the overheard picture of when Horry hit that shot for the Lakers? The entire arena rises in 1 moment. That's seriously f'n holy. At the same time, sports is all marketing, which is sad. Every time I turned around, someone was offering me a beach towel, a duffel bag, or something of that variety if I registered for a credit card or signed some piece of paper. It got fairly annoying, to be perfectly honest. And, the whole "dealership" thing with regard to memorabilia was on display - 1/2 of the place was devoted to memory dealers, and you had to wonder if Jordan really wants his 1982 UNC game-worn jersey being sold for $1395. I don't know how it all works, but I've heard it's a pretty scandalous, backdoor operation. Is baseball truly America's game? It's probably football right now, although that answer does vary geographically. And despite the international marketing success of the NBA, I don't think they have something like this... or maybe they do... you know, with their All-Star Games and whatnot. Baseball is such a summer, family-oriented game, and Americans love the notion of "summer" so much (lazy bastards we all are), I suppose it makes sense that baseball should be America's game. I played PS2 after waiting behind a series of small children for upwards of 30 minutes. It convinced me that indeed, I think I need to buy a video game system of some kind. The other thought I had was that I should become a fan of the Texas Rangers, or organize a softball team for my new apartment complex. It's funny how large-scale logistical clusterfucks make me think about creating other, larger-scale logistical clusterfucks. I think I've also, gradually, realized that all I really need for happiness is a sports-related publication, air conditioning, and potentially something of an alcohol variety, although that's entirely contextual. I spent yesterday afternoon watching Astros vs. Dodgers and reading Sports Illustrated (the Manny Ramirez cover - the lead article, on Manny, was horrible, although 10 reasons why baseball is back was cool, if financially fact-laden) and it was utter bliss. Question of the Day Is Miami the new hot spot of American sports? (This question boils down to: "Will the Dolphins be any good?")
When Kerry and Edwards talk of "values" and then Bush and Cheney talk of "values" and correspondingly speak of "raising American values," do you ever get the feeling that they realize they're all truly on the same page, and just trying to be different for the sake of keeping up a national election? Someone's planning a show called "Amish in the City," McDonald's recently got sued for its French Fries, and cnn.com interviewed UPenn frat boys about who they would rather do kegstands with, Kerry or Bush. It's good to know that the mainstream media frequently picks up articles from theonion.com. Speaking of which, I've read Houston Chronicle the past 3 days basically cover to cover, and gradually realized that about 85 percent of their content is picked up from somewhere else... Where the hell is Randy Johnson going to land? Boston? Schilling and Johnson, part 2... and yet somehow I think the Yankees will still win the American League. Or, honestly, the Rangers... man, they're playing some good ball. With Brad Fullmer - a guy I saw in A Ball - as their cleanup man. Expos retreads... ah... The biggest sham about not being in college anymore is that it's harder to justify to yourself that you're a kid, so it's harder to do stupid things in terms of spending money. It's a shame, really. Man, I'd really like to cover the minor leagues for a year or two... I bet that's the ultimate in human condition reporting. Question of the Day Do you trade Shaq? If so, what do you demand for him?
My office didn't have Internet for essentially 99 percent of the workday. It was hysterical to watch people justify their lack of work (myself included) because of the Internet being down. What did people do before the Internet? I really have no idea. An old woman in my office was noted to tell a coworker with regards to a magazine cover, "Look at this Lindsay Lohan. 17, and look at these knockers!" I laughed my ass off. Gagne finally blew a save. In reality, I don't care - the Dodgers still suck, except for Milton Bradley and Adrian Beltre. While Gagne is an amazing closer, he already killed this record, and at some point it had to end... it's just a shame it had to be to the DBacks, managed by Mets retread Al Pedrique. I'm glad Edwards got picked, because in reality, could you see Tom Vilisack as President of the United States? There's a segment on SportsCenter where some high school senior committed to Duke e-mailed Coach K about how much Coach K means to Duke. Apparently, this swayed the decision. Right. I'm sure the fact that the Lakers will suck next year also swayed the approach; I must admit though, the segment has tug-at-the-heartstrings potential. Last night, I read a book called "What Your Sixth Grader Needs to Know" which contained a diverse section on American history. It's amazing how stupid I am, in that I understood the Vietnam war better from a 3 paragraph description than I did from the months I covered it in HS social studies / history classes. I watched a segment on ABC about life in the minor leagues last night. Amazing. Did you know Mitch Williams is the coach of the Atlantic City Surf? Amazing. Is Dan Brown ever going to leave the NY Times Best Seller List? Question of the Day Is this approach of "Edwards was Kerry's 2nd choice, and his first choice is aligned with us?" going to work for Bush?
I tried to post yesterday, but I don't think it worked. Basically, it was a convoluted stream of consciousness about how 4th of July is an overrated holiday. I started thinking about that a little bit more on Sunday night, as I gazed at the stars in an outdoor park while straining to hear the Houston Symphony Orchestra. I think 4th of July can be overrated, but, like everything, it depends on context. The cool thing about it is: it's one of those days, each year, where you can really mark your life. "What were you doing on 4th of July 2001?" You'll probably remember. I'd argue it's that, your birthday, New Year's Eve / Day, and then one random event every five years, such as the assassination of a prominent figure or the death of a loved one. Milestone days, that's what I mean. I'm glad Coach K decided to stay - better for college basketball in general, better for the ACC (which is trying to become a conference dedicated to big money football), and better for the Lakers (he would have sucked). Now, the Lakers probably take Rudy T, keep Kobe, and send Shaq to Dallas. Wow, the Spurs are def. gonna win the West next year - and mark my words, the Grizzlies get a top five seed, even with the Hornets entering the conference. Not that anyone cares, but I'm saying if I was Kerry, my order would be: Edwards, Vilisack (sp), Gephardt. Not that anyone cares, but where's Mario Cuomo's speech at the DNC? 4th of July really inspired a Norman Rockwell style bullshit spirit in me - you know, seeing kids frolic on a grassy plain and make up rules to their own games, seeing couples snuggle on blankets, and random 40 year old single guys with Coors Light bottles staring at the sky. 4th of July, in some sad and some amazing ways, really is the essence of America: laid back, detached, yet at the same time, oddly passionate. Doesn't someone wish Michael Moore would make a documentary about NIKE and Phil Knight? People are making a big deal of the fact that the NL All-Star outfield is Griffey, Bonds, Sosa. Woo f'n hoo. Check this: the AL infield? Giambi, Soriano, Jeter, ARod. Hehe. That coulda been this year's Yankee infield. Question of the Day Does the Koran truly justify violence?
When I was like 16 and had nothing to do on New Year's Eve, my mom once told me that New Year's Eve is the "most overrated holiday of the year." Statement has some creedence, even if it was only said to ease the depressing heaves of sighing from an adolescent. New Year's Eve is a bitch - you spend a lot of time planning to do something, you spend way too much money, and you're usually unfulfilled in the end result. Shameful. But then take a look at July 4th - it's a cool holiday in that it celebrates our liberation from an oppressive tyrant (insert ironic lightbulb moment here), but at the same time, it's overrated in its own sense. The thing is... your actions on July 4th mirror your development as a human being. What the hell am I talking about, you ask? Consider it: when you're younger, you spend 4th frolicing with family, extended family, and neighborhood friends. Norman Rockwell would bust a nut over it. Then, you approach college years, and you spend 4th getting pretty drunk and eating undercooked hamburgers thrown together by a guy wearing college mesh shorts (maybe that's just me). You get older, and you spend it at the pool of your apartment complex. Even though I'm making no sense right now, let's just leave it at this: 4th of July can be pretty overrated as well. CNN is interviewing Vanessa Kerry and trying to pump her for information on who the VP will be. Better question: when your father invokes the word "values" every 48 seconds in speeches, what exactly does he mean? I think golf is actually more interesting to watch on television than tennis. Spider Man 2 gives hopes for a new generation of nerd filmmakers obsessed with comic book tales, even though Sam Raimi is by no means a nerd. I mean, can't we have more comic book megamovies that explore the soul of the superhero's alter-ego, ala Spider Man 2? I don't think "Hellboy" or the shitty 1991 Captain America movie really did that. I think someone needs to make a Silver Surfer movie, and really get to the core of what makes Silver Surfer tick as a human being and a fighter of evil. I also liked Captain America back in the day; if I ever became famous, I'd write a script for a new C-America movie. Question of the Day Are there any attractive male rappers?
Last night on SportsCenter, I heard Linda Cohn refer to the 2001 New York Yankees (or, rather, probably the Yankees in general) as "the evil empire." Granted, and fair... the Yankees do use their incredible wealth - rather, the wealth of their owner - to pursue free agents ad nauseam, and acquire infields like Jeter-ARod-Giambi. I understand. Still, I was a bit pissed off that Bob Brenly was painted as the new Luke Skywalker, defeating the evil empire. First of all, the 2001 Yankees weren't so bad, the DBacks had the best 1-2 pitching punch in perhaps the history of the league, and let me, for a second, reference the 9-11 factor. While I don't agree that New York "needed the Yankees to win the 2001 World Series," because 9-11 was less than 2 months prior, it's still something to consider. Don't call the Yankees evil. They're moderately evil, sort of like midwestern Republicians seeking a third Senate term. They're not horribly evil, like, you know, the Middle East. I'm just kidding. In related news, Game 1 of the 2001 World Series was so boring that I spent most of the game watching Washington State vs. Cal, when Jason Gesser was QB of Washington State. Whatever happened to Jason Gesser? I think he's on the Titans. Bill Cosby drew some ire for his comments on black parenting styles. While normally I wouldn't post about something like this, given that it's all over the news, and who really cares what I think, I do happen to teach in the inner city for 10 months of the year, so I feel I have a little bit of information on black parenting styles. Actually, I only had 2 black families in my class last year, and I thought they were relatively charming. There's a boatload of problems with American education, that teachers and teacher certification courses tend to blame on a variety of factors, most notably the "No Child Left Behind Act" of 2001, which actually leaves most children behind. The real problems are inherently institutional, and I don't know - nor am I smart enough - to figure out how to fix poverty. I can tell you being President probably sucks 98 percent of the time, but 2 percent would involve being serenaded by Jessica Simpson on 4th of July. One time in Maxim, she said "My boobs always get in the way!" True. So does her stupidity. I bet Dawkins is glad he didn't take the GU job, eh? Can you really believe Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, and then as Batman? Question of the Day When Iowa Governor Tom Vilisack (sp?) says in his speeches, "I grew up at 401 Main Street," does it endear him to small-town America or make him seem like a clown forcing Norman Rockwell down our throats?
Last night I was watching "The High Price of Fame" on E, strictly out of boredom / wanting my girlfriend to have enough time to study for MCATs. First of all, they voted Phoebe Cates' nude scene in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" (a thoroughly entertaining film, granted) to be the most memorable nude scene of all time. Total bunk. I can think of thousands of more memorable nude scenes. Halle Berry in Monster's Ball? Angelina Jolie in Sin? Kristin Davis in Sex and the City? I checked out E Online because they had an ad for it (I'm a stereotype). They were selling Ted Casablanca boxers, which read "Put some sass in your ass." Uh. I'm wondering - if Duke players suck in the pros, and college coaches suck in the pros, is this Coach K to the Lakers thing really that good an idea? It's sad that Marlon Brando died, although not in a tangible, show-your-tears type of way. I'd argue Reagan's death might have been that, if only because of the overly intense media coverage of his laying in-state, transport to the Capitol, etc. I felt like a tool for shedding a few tears, but I did. What was I talking about? Oh yea, Brando. "On the Waterfront" is an American class, and so is "The Godfather." That one he made, 'Dr. Moreau's Island' or whatever it is, that was, in the words of The New York Times TV Guide, "a real pavement cracker." Sadly, he didn't age well, but I do give him props for his earlier roles. I should probably watch his turn in Streetcar, seeing as how I've never seen it. Foxsports runs the headline "Suns grab super hot free agent." Steve Nash? Super hot? He's more burned out than a guy in row five at the Bob Marley Fest from running the Mavs' "We score 103, but we give up 110" offense for the past couple years. He'll probably do well with Marion, Johnson, and Stoudmire, though... if the Suns had room and got Kobe or someone, they could really shake some shite up in the West. Is July 4th a more or less overrated holiday than New Year's Eve? Why does espn.com list Adonal Foyle - perhaps best known as a staunch campaign finance reform advocate - as one of the 15 Best Free Agents on the market? Question of the Day Who should be the Democratic veep choice?
Hey everybody. ("Hey Dr. Nick!" - refrain) You ever read blogs on the Internet and think to yourself (or, conversely, say to yourself, as I know I talk aloud), "Jesus, who cares what this dude thinks? I'd rather hear Chris Matthews discuss this!" Disgusted, you hurl your DSL cable into your Craig's List-purchased Popizon (acceptable spelling, although some prefer Papasan) Chair and turn on the TV, smiling brightly. I'm not sure what I'm doing here. Not at all, really. But I figure it will take shape eventually. My promises, for now: - Try not to author viewpoints on things I don't understand - Try not to post random links that take you places I wouldn't understand either - Try not to be an ass Sh*t, guess that last one is already done for. I know about three things in life: sports, pop culture, and using the Internet to find out random facts. I can tell you why "Igby Goes Down" is a modern-day "Catcher in the Rye," or dine with you over notions of why Grizzlies vs. Nuggets will be the Bulls vs. Knicks feud of 2010 and beyond. I couldn't name more than 10 US Senators, although I'm mildly socially aware. I didn't know I was liberal until I was just about 21; now I bask in the reflected glow of that narrow description daily. I believe that if Donna Martin can graduate from HS, anything is possible. I believe to become a well-read blog, I need a rotating hook. Let's try this: Question of the Day. Question of the Day Where does Kobe play next year? Where does Shaq play next year?
First of all, why am I at school at 5:34pm? I saw a teacher aide (salary hovers around $28,000 a year) driving an Escalade to school today. That's cool, but at the same time, slightly confusing. Since I didn't post yesterday (out of utter fatigue and exhaustion), I feel the need to come through with some updates today. The "hell kid" (everyone has one) who I was supposed to get didn't show up on the first day... but oh... oh... on the second day, as I stood in the hallway talking to the other third grade teacher, I saw him bounding down the hallway, jumping at every EXIT sign. As my heart skipped 10 beats and my stomach fell about 11 feet southbound, he arrived at my door with a yellow entrance slip and proceeded to behave well for about 10 minutes, followed by being off-task most of the rest of the time. Now, through 2 days - about um, 10 hours total together - he's run over to the computer and signed onto Internet Explorer without permission three (3) times. Man, my life is a joke. Just so you know, I stop him every time and explain why that's a bad idea, etc... I don't let it happen. But just the sheer incredulty of it happening, right? Or, you know, something. Last year, I almost never used textbooks as a teaching tool, preferring instead poorly-crafted lessons that accomplished next to nothing. This year, I feel textbooks might be a more structured, fine-tuned approach to student gains. I have two things planned for tomorrow involving textbooks, and one is a magic square activity with single-digit addition. The sheer chances of this working are so SLIM ... naw, I guess I should remain positive on this blog, right? 172 days left. What's wrong with Team USA Basketball? When did gymnastics become so captivating? Why am I more intrigued by preseason football than early pennant chase baseball? What am I doing at school at 5:45pm?
I've got this timeline type paper above my bulletin board (and hence my calendar) where I write what number day of school it is. It was glorious last year to write "175" on May 27th. Today, I just kept looking at the "1" and internally sobbing. It wasn't so bad - teaching moves fairly quickly if you actually have an idea what you're doing, which I may or may not come the dreaded month of October. Still, despite a slightly underprepared first day, I came out OK, except for the muscle aches, hardcore fatigue, and desire to crawl into bed and never get out. I had a little girl throw up twice today - she threw up about 8:20am, I sent her to the nurse... the nurse sent her back, she tossed her cookies again around 10:10am, I sent her back to the nurse... she came to lunch with us, didn't eat anything, and again she went back to the nurse... then back to me, said she felt sick... back to the nurse... finally, the aunt came and got her. You can't really prepare for that kind of stuff. I had a kid vomit on his desk during reading in my first year, then sit and stare at it as I tried to hustle him off to the nurse. Man, I never thought I'd write that last paragraph. Tomorrow holds the promise of a reading assessment (a state reading test administered 2 years ago) which I will score and present to my principal. Funniest shit is, last year I did this, took about 3 weeks to do it, had no idea why I was doing it, and finally submitted it, never looking at it again. Hopefully this time I have some form of a clue. Ah... Wednesday's the half day... it's almost here.
Ah... the time is almost here. Day one of 175 geared towards attempting to give a bunch of 8 year olds a better stock in life, guided by rhetoric over realism, inspiration over facts, and determination and will over everything else. I'll tell you - it's really hard. I don't feel a need to get all preachy here, because I definitely could, but what good would that do? Here's the thing, though. People talk about the differences between public schools and private schools, right? Private schools are obviously well-resourced, and have teachers slightly more dedicated because of larger pay scales. OK, those are the basic facts that would seem to distinguish a private school education from a public school education in terms of base quality. However, here's something I was thinking in the shower this morning. I can certainly do a lot in terms of a classroom teacher this year - but, there's only SO much I can do. See, the kids have to WANT to be there, and need a framework for learning and understanding and paying attention. Because you probably have more affluent (thus, more free time) parents in private schools, the children have a greater framework for all those factors. I can make students WANT to be at school, and love being there... but I only have them for so many hours in a given day. During the other hours, they might be speaking Spanish, watching television, being unsupervised, or any number of other things. I think I need a more substantial parental involvement plan this year. My points seemed more salient when I first crafted them, but I think everything seems more salient in the shower, if you really think about it. With regard to James McGreevey, is the bad thing that he's a gay leader, that he lied about being a gay leader, or that he led his wife into a web of lies? I'm not sure exactly where the blame falls. With regard to USA Basketball, was this team really such a good idea? With regard to the MLB season, did anyone see this coming with the Cardinals? Jason Marquis? Woody Williams? And how did they get Larry Walker? Last year before the first day, I was nervous, yet also excited and jazzed full of idealism. This year before the first day, I'm pacing myself for a marathon, and trying to keep things as simple and directive as possible. I wonder if that's a sign of maturity, or apathy.
I don't really understand how my school publicizes Meet Your Teacher Day - they put it on the marquee in front of the school, sure... but what does that do? I mean, most of the kids that go to my school don't actually LIVE near my school (ironic, right?) Rather, because it's considered a halfway decent public elementary school (which has nothing - absolutely nothing - to do with my presence there), people list their grandmother or aunt or cousin as their permanent address, and thus get zoned for JW Oates. Hence, about 1/2 of our school is related in some manner. Additionally, the coordinator of my school (essentially the Assistant Principal) had no idea how we publicize the event, which left me further confused. Regardless, the point is... I always get burned on these things. Last year at "Meet Your Teacher Night" (a mid-September event), I got about 5 people. Last year at this event, I got about six. Today, I got 5. I got 1 girl that I taught last year - nice girl, very cute, dedicated to her family, but has something against effort. She almost never tries. See, if I knew what I was doing last year, I would have looked at her permanent folder and seen that all her previous teachers wrote "(Name) always says the assignment is too hard." I found that out the last week of school, after she did that to me all year. I should nurture her more this year - I got in her face a few times last year, yelling about how giving effort is more important than nothing at all. In related news, I had one kid scream "I hate reading! I hate school!" while in my presence. I thought to myself, "Wow, should be a fun year..." My room looks nice, I'll give myself credit for that (vaguely). I basically tried to be as simplistic as possible this year, as opposed to all the RAH RAH RAH messages I employed last year - "Together Everyone Achieves More (TEAM)" and "Work Hard, Play Hard, Get Smart." This year I'm just gonna teach, and try to avoid all the bullshit. I'll discipline when necessary, but if a kid can't deal with it - they usually can't - I'm just going to press ahead. My question of the day should be, "Who tells these kids what school is for?" I guarantee you on the first day this Monday, about 8 of 15 kids in my class have a toy of some kind. Why? Why would you POSSIBLY need a toy at school, where you're supposed to "learn?" I don't remember bringing toys to school unless the teacher explicitly stated we could, but then again, I suppose I'm comparing apples and oranges, right? Saw my girlfriend at lunch of her MCATs. I felt really bad, because the girl busts her ass day in and day out, and then doesn't feel as confident on the actual test. I hate it when effort isn't rewarded, especially long, pronounced effort. She's taking the second portion right now - I hope she kicks it in the ass, because she is capable of it and she deserves to succeed on that test. Man, I can't believe school starts on Monday and doesn't end until May of 2005... wow...
I'm almost finished with my classroom as of Thursday afternoon. Additionally, I've created a "Contest Corner" on one wing of JW Oates, allowing students and teachers to see contests open to elementary school students. Innvoations this year - current events bulletin board, larger space for displaying student work, more tableclothes. There's some odd, or perhaps not odd in the least, self-absorption at my school. I asked a few people to help me with things around my room today, and no one did. I ended up spending about 4 hours getting all this crap together, a time that probably could have been shaved to 2.5 hours if people had been willing to help. I understand, it was just sad. I'm not really sure how to feel about this year, but I think I should wait to consider that notion until at least Saturday, when my girlfriend finishes MCATs. For now, I'll say I'm not digging waking up early or contemplating all the work ahead of me. I haven't gotten fully hyped about college or pro football this year, nor have I really been following baseball, except for day-old results in the Chronicle. In many respects, I feel like a failure as a sports fan, but I still argue Georgia vs. LSU is the centerpiece game of the upcoming college football season, and the Cowboys will suck. Texans and Redskins will both be 8-8, and I have no idea who will win the Super Bowl (Patriots?).
Day 2 back at school. Confidence gaining slowly. Stealing an idea from my girlfriend, I think I'm going to make a "Current Events" bulletin board and attempt to incorporate it, somehow, with the "Morning Meeting / Message." The underlying theory is, even if I don't do it as successfully as I want to, it gives kids exposure to newspapers and magazines, and the purpose they serve. They probably don't have that exposure anywhere else. I also think I'm going to use a "Journaling" approach, where students solve various problems in personal, self-designed journal notebooks, the theory there being that when you write down problems and the steps to solve them, you remember it all more. Those two things, albeit simple, might make things a bit hotter this year (in a good sense). Had a training this afternoon. While usually pointless, this training provided clear, usable information. I can't decide whether I think this information is usable because I know HOW to use it (because I'm a second year, and more makes sense) or because it actually IS more usable. I think it might be a combination of both. My current MLB Playoff Predictions: AL: Yankees, Red Sox, Twins, As NL: Braves, Cardinals, Cubs, Dodgers Teams to Consider: White Sox, Giants, Padres, Rangers I wish more news outlets would profile "key races" in the Senate and House, because I'd love to know more about those battle lines.
The decimal reference in the title refers to Summer 2003, when I used to entertain my yellow school bus morning mates by telling us all what week, and what day, of TFA training it was (ala, Week 2, Day 3 would be "2.3"). I rolled back to JW Oates today, and immediately began the compare and contrast process between my life presently, and a year prior. There were still various pieces of classroom furniture all over the hallways. Various faculty members were cracking awkward inside jokes. The place smelled the same. The really dedicated, determined teachers almost had their rooms finished. I was extremely tired. The meetings were a mix of cheer, boredom, and inane chatter (with some solid motivation). In reality, the only difference was that I'm a year older. Honestly, you ever associate a smell with a place, or a smell with a feeling? Every time I walk into JW Oates and smell it in late summer, I get this feeling... I can't really explain the feeling, but it's kind of like a mix of excitement and dread, almost the feeling you get when you reach the front of a 1 hour line for a rollercoaster. Like, you denied reality for so long, right? But then there it is, before you, and it's going to be cool, but also suck at points. I don't know if that made any sense, but I tried. I'm teaching third grade this year, which means I have most of the same kids I had last year. This basically means I'd need to work harder in terms of establishing rules, procedures, and consequences, so that I can actually get some stuff done and not be bogged down by the behavior of my students. I was assigned this kid, whose identity I'll protect for right now (but probably not by 3 weeks from now), who has a long history of behavior problems (long history = ironic because he's only 8). Let's see how I do with this challenge. He exposed himself to girls at recess last year. The background noise to this posting, ESPN (what else), just called the NFC East the "toughest division in football." Eh, I guess... but in reality, only the Eagles have a chance to win it. The Skins are a year away, the Cowboys have a 41 year old under center. The Giants, conversely, have a 22 year old under center, and the Cardinals... are they in the NFC East anymore? As a final note, don't get me wrong as I keep posting about my life at JW Oates. Teaching may not be for me - I think this will gradually emerge as you read posts about my classroom management starting next week - but I do think it's a good thing to do for 2 years, and... I've met some tremendously dedicated, creative people who would be kicking ass and taking names in a variety of professions, but choose to dedicate their time and committment to this random elementary school off the eastern part of the Houston ship channel. By the way, there's a school profile - and caricatures of old teachers - in the local McDonald's. Kick ass.
I think I'm going to start moving this blog in a new direction: a summary of the bizzarre shite I see every day as a front-line member of the war on educational inequality. Or, basically, a recap of my days in the classroom. If I changed the tag line for this blog, I might (if I was dork), write, "A blog with a LiveJournal feel." Fortunately, I'm not a dork - or at least not that big a dork - so I'll just go ahead and keep the "Donna Martin Graduates" title. I think the "graduates" thing makes a lot more sense now, doesn't it? OK, so I returned to the inner workings of JW Oates Elementary on Saturday (yesterday). I didn't so much as return to the school site itself, as I returned to a nondescript building in Houston Heights, "The Houston Achievement Place." A team of about 10 workers guided the JW Oates staff through the "Project CLASS" training. Yes, in this case, CLASS is an acronym, but I don't remember exactly what it's for - Creating something or other, I think. First off, I rolled up at 8:30am, which the e-mail about the inservice said was the time it started. As I walked in, it turns out basically my entire faculty was already there. Apparently we were supposed to be there at 8am, essentially making me look bad in front of my principal, who already doesn't like me. Ah... then I go to sign in, and I'm listed as a third grade teacher, despite the fact that I thought I was teaching 4th grade, which is really charming because 3rd grade would indicate I get the same kids as I got last year... AHHHH.... wow. As I started having chest pains and thinking about all the things I'd have to overcome as a teacher of the same students I had last year, I realized that there was still a vacancy for a fifth and sixth grade math teacher... hmmm, I thought. Was it possible? Quickly doing some investigative work, I put my odds of landing a fifth/sixth grade position at near 20 percent, so I decided I would draft an e-mail when I got home, but not before getting suffienct faculty support before I went through with it. Meanwhile, as I stared at the cut-up green carpet and sighed deeply, I realized that at the front of the room, several 50 year old women were wearing sunglasses and dancing around singing, "Stop, Look, and Listen... it's the key to Success." I started wondering: why is it that people in education feel a need to make asses of themselves for a worthwhile cause? I mean, I guess Donald Rumsfeld once sang "Fly like an eagle" or "On Eagle's Wings" or something, so I suppose everyone makes an ass out of themselves at one point or another... but this seemed like a new version. Then, one of the women presenting, who apparently was married to another guy presenter, made some joke about him getting spanked that evening, eliciting nervous laughter and awkward stares from a room full of inner-city, public school educators. I really do respect teachers for how hard they work, and how much they sacrifice. I just don't know why, exactly, several half-century old women felt the need to revisit the "Men in Black" concept to model for us a way to teach rules and procedures to the class. In totally unrelated news, I think I'd rather be enshrined in the NFL Hall of Fame as opposed to the MLB Hall of Fame, because you get a bust, as opposed to a slightly 3D plaque. Um, is there a NHL Hall of Fame? It's probably in Canada, right? Or northern Michigan?
Companies know one thing, teens are easy targets. From Coca-Cola offering free mp3 downloads when purchasing their products ( which is pure crap ) to getting free mp3 players when signing up to cell phone plans, it's all an endless loop of nothing. Teens are more vulnerable because they are easily convinced that having all these little gadgets (which companies make them believe they can't live without) will make them more "IN”. Take McDonald's for example which shows teens doing sports eating a super sized meal, why would anyone eat that crap, i mean that's all it is, and then society complains that teens are overweight and that there's an obesity problem, hello?? We need to feed our teen's minds and bodies with goodness and not crapiness. All we ever do is talk and talk and talk about issues and problems, how about actually doing something about it? The only reason nothing is being done is because of big corporations bringing in the big money and stopping at nothing to protect that money at a pretty hefty cost i may ad. So you teens out there, stop and think about what companies really want from you, your well being? Most likely no, your buck? Most definatly yes, and they are willing to make you believe anything for it, even if it means ruining your mental and physical health to get it.

From floating ads on the web to SMS messages on you personal cell phone, companies are desperate to get your buck.It's almost pathetic to see them go at it.To me these attemps to get consumers attention in any means necessary is a turnoff, who are they to tell me what i need, i know exactly what i need, and whenever i buy something, it's definatly not because of a web popup, i get loads of solicitation emails, you know what i do with them, i trash them, without sneeking a peek, to me the more a company tries to use these methods the more i ignore them. Everywhere you look, boom, an ad.Being the freethinker that i am i've had to take extreme mesures, from not watching TV anymore to arriving late at the theaters just so i won't have to sit there and watch TV like commercials on a big screen.Where is all of this going? Mediatic chaos. SykoPAT
Ever watched the news? Of course you have, we all do. Now what seems to dominate news reports is murders and claims that certain foods or beverage can now cause cancer or some damn thing like that. Phrases like "What you don't know may kill you", the word Kill is probably to most used word in the media next to death and murder. All this repetitiveness has but one goal, to create fear within the public, why? Simple fear makes people vulnerable, to whom? Higher powers of course. Being Canadian i don't have to actually witness this to often, but in the states people are so deep in fear from the terrorist attacks to anthrax to gang violence that's it's hard for them to know what's real and what's not. And who comes to the rescue, Mr. Bush telling all Americans that his plans against "terrorism" will make the American public safe again. Safe he says? more like i’ll be able to manipulate you like i want now and pass laws that would of never passed before the inflicted fears. So open your eyes people to all these fake fears, life isn’t that complicate unless someone makes it complicate. Enjoy life, treasure it, embrace it, live it. In conclusion i would like to raise my glass to a Mr. Michael Moore, an inspiration to all peace lovers and freethinkers.
Earlier I wrote about how I'd bought the final component for my new PC, but it turns out I was wrong. I managed to miss the fact that my motherboard doesn't have on-board video, so I needed a video card. I picked one up yesterday, plugged it in, and fired up my PC for the first time. There's a slight problem with the floppy drive, but apart from that, the as-yet-unnamed PC is fully functional. I have yet to install the operating system, because: a) the keyboard is a fancy affair that needs a special driver installed before it can send function keystroke signals and b) the Windows XP installation requires you to press F8 to say you agree to the licence. I'll try plugging it into a USB port instead of its current PS/2 port tonight. Mokalus of Borg PS - I'd post pictures, if I had any. PPS - Maybe some other time.
How do you prioritise when everything is urgent and none of it is easy? That is, everything will take some time to do, it needs to be done really quickly, and there is more than one project behaving like this. I'm at a loss. When things get hectic, I tend to fold over and let myself fail. I've never found out why that might be. Perhaps I don't believe in myself or my abilities enough. But when I think of it that way, it doesn't paint the whole picture. I don't think I fear success, though I do shy away from both compliments and criticism. "Let me do my own thing at my own pace, and keep your opinions to yourself", I seem to say. Unfortunately, this is not the way the world works. I'm not supposed to make myself an island. I don't think I am. I'll ask for help when I need it and I think you can provide it. But when the phrase "my responsibility alone" crosses my mind, it's all over. Mokalus of Borg PS - Hopefully, one day, I'll run out of introspective things to say here. PPS - Maybe when I'm eighty or so.
Last night I forgot to set my alarm clock, so this morning I was glad that I still live with my Dad who still makes sure that meal times are family times. I was up a little later than I planned, but when I rearranged my morning routine, everything fitted in nicely and I still had time for fifteen minutes of reading before I left for work. I'm breezing through Isaac Asimov's " I, Robot " partly because it's a classic I recently bought and partly because I've seen a trailer for the upcoming movie. It looks to me like the movie will be incredibly unfaithful to the Three Laws and Asimov's vision for the world of robots. To be sure, his stories usually involve something going wrong with a robot, but the movie shows blatant breakage of the First Law on a wide scale by thousands of robots. The story as I remember it never had anything like that. I guess the original story couldn't make much of a movie. So why try to make one? I'll probably go see it anyway. Mokalus of Borg PS - Well, that drifted rather rapidly off-topic, didn't it? PPS - urlLink The Three Laws of Robotics .
Today I purchased the last necessary part of my new PC - the mouse. Actually, it's an optical trackball, because that's all I have room for on my desk. Tonight's project will be to connect everything together, fire it up and see if it works. It's possible I've put the case fan in backwards, and I'm sure there will be some issues with the hard drive and DVD/CDRW drive living on the same IDE cable. The rest should be fine. Mokalus of Borg PS - If it isn't, I'll probably give up for a week or so. PPS - But not forever, of course.
A few weeks ago I bought a packet of chips - I think they were Burger Rings. Inside the packet was a small metal disc that ruined my life - a Yu-Gi-Oh Tazo Metallix. I call myself addicted because I don't much care about the chips or Yu-Gi-Oh, but I've been buying an average of three packets of chips every two days, just to get more. To borrow a phrase from another cartoon, I've gotta catch 'em all. I now own 17 discs, each of which has cost me $1.50. Yes, I got some chips with them, but I'd have been just as happy to throw the chips away and keep the Tazo. 17 discs at $1.50 each comes to $25.50 over a week or two. I'm likely to keep going. My only hope is that the newly-opened Subway just down the road can take all my money before my Tazo collection does. Mokalus of Borg PS - Having no control over one's wallet is an odd feeling. PPS - This must be what it's like to be married. ;)
Some days you wake up feeling good. Today seems to be one of those, despite the fact that I am, once again, turning to chemical aids to stay awake. Today's wake-up call is Milo "Energy Food Drink" which sounds very stupid when you put it like that. Doesn't taste great. Slightly bitter. Anyway, probably contributing to the general good mood was the bus ride to work. I should start by saying that I name some of the familiar strangers I see on the bus. Today I sat next to "Lisa". I usually travel in silence, either reading or staring out the window, apart from an occasional "bless you" response to a sneeze. Today was no exception to the vow of silence. Sometimes it just feels good to be in the presence of people with whom no speech is necessary. Awkward pauses are the worst. Everyone please raise your caffeinated beverages in a toast to silence. Mokalus of Borg PS - But no clinking them together. PPS - Man, this Milo better be worth it.
Every man (and probably some women, too) wants to be more than an ordinary man. We want to be stronger, faster or smarter than the average man. To leap tall buildings in a single hyperbole. We want this because we love power and superiority, and superhuman powers are, to most people, power without responsibility. The way we demonstrate our "incredible" powers varies, of course, but it usually amounts to biting off more than we can chew, then attempting to make it look easy. The results are more often comical than impressive. I have been the perpetrator of such showoff behaviour myself, more than once. I blame testosterone. I think I've learned to deal with the small doses well enough, but the big hits can still take me down to the level of parading monkey. Here's to being unwitting victims of our body chemistry. Mokalus of Borg PS - I really should get around to linking to this blog from my website. PPS - Yeah, I'll do that urlLink Real Soon Now .
Man, I could really use a day off. I don't think I'd do anything much with it, besides sleep, but I do think it would do me a world of good. Recently I've been very bogged down outside work. Work itself is fine, really. The way I know I'm too busy is that I've had to make a schedule to cram everything in and remember it all. The kind of schedule I can handle fits inside my slightly-oversized memory. This one doesn't. Two weeks and counting down. Mokalus of Borg PS - The PS/PPS style is starting to feel a bit tacked-on here. PPS - But this is what I do, so I'll just keep on doing it.
How to disintegrate spiders This morning, as I was washing the dishes, a small spider appeared near the sink. I left it alone, but still vowed to destroy the creature should it get in my way. As it turns out, that was unnecessary. Our young Mr Spider was drawn to the hot water, and dipped a toe in. It seems that was too much for it, as it turned around to make a hasty retreat. Unfortunately, it slipped and fell backwards into the suds. As I cleared the bubbles aside to check on the fate of the little monster, I was surprised to find that every one of its legs had fallen off. Apparently, this is what happens to spiders in hot water. Mokalus of Borg PS - And thus nature has presented me with yet another spider-annihilating method. PPS - "Science again! I said science again!" - Homestar Runner
Blog on Blogging or "The Why" I've been asked why on earth I would do something like this, and my immediate response was "Because the world needs to hear and ignore what I have to say". That's probably pretty much it. I'm happy for my thoughts to be on the web, even if nobody's reading them. Like shouting into the desert. So what's the point? It's psychological, of course. I can't tell if anyone's reading or not (most likely not, so far) but they could be, and that's what matters. It's not like I'm writing in a journal nobody can ever read at all, or won't until I'm dead. This one is out there for everyone to see. Most of my need to express myself is already fulfilled in my paper journal, and that one nobody will see until I'm gone. That's probably why updates here will be so infrequent. There's not much difference between the two. So I've got to figure out what I want to say here. Back when I knew everything, I wanted to tell people how to be better (especially my fellow males), how to design better software and how to become a person to be feared. Now I probably just want to talk about software. I guess I'm not going anywhere with this. Best to quit while I'm still relatively coherent. Mokalus of Borg PS - There are some behaviours I know I should not encourage. PPS - Usually they are the ones I allow to continue the longest.
The Joys of Code Re-use Any programmer who's worked on a project of any notable size would like to re-use code. I certainly do, and I usually plan objects that way. I've been working on one project (in C#.NET) for over a year now, and have developed a business layer that is reasonably generic, but still needs lots of work. A few days ago I was given another small project - an online graduate job application form - and I decided to re-use my business code. That part was relatively easy, although it could be easier. The hard part was the web front end. Okay, to be honest, the web controls code I was using was more specific to the old project, so it wasn't much intended to be re-used, but I did it anyway. That just served to highlight the point that a generic web front end framework would be really useful. Besides the hoops I had to jump through to get the thing working, it's not extensible. If I need a new control - say, a date input - then I can write it, but I need to go back to the original code and modify that, too. This makes me think there is a better way, like an interface. I think I can make it better, but it would take lots of time that the company probably wouldn't pay me for. In all, and as usual, the more interesting job is writing frameworks, tools and components rather than writing actual applications. Mokalus of Borg PS - A true hacker, I suppose, is the programming equivalent of a research professor. PPS - That is, the ideas matter more than whether this will actually be used by anyone.
The Borg Blog has had its wish of becoming a real boy granted! Mokalus of Blog is now online at its new Blogger.com home, and I plan to stay here for just a little while. Before anyone notices and gets upset, there is another Mokalus in this world. I was surprised to discover this one day when I went ego-surfing at Google. I thought, way back in 1997 or so, that I had created a unique name that would be unlikely to crop up again. Apparently I was wrong. My doppelganger (sp?) is also a blogger, and he lives at urlLink http://mokalus.blogspot.com/ . I've only given it a cursory glance, really, but he seems to love Jesus, so I've got no gripes. I will probably post here only a few times a week, because I know how busy you all are. ;) Peace, out. Mokalus of Borg PS - I have yet to decide if I should stick with my "PS/PPS" post style in the blog. PPS - I'll give it a try for a while, at least.
To me, a Zen garden is a profoundly beautiful thing, with raked sand around stones. Of course, that's not the only form of Zen garden, but it's the form that we've latched onto as Westerners. It seems either stupid or strange to condense such an object into a size conventient for desktop use. It seems like a typical Western bent on an Eastern design: distil, condense, simplify, mass-produce and sell. I'll admit that it is entirely possible, say, to create a desktop Zen garden that does not betray its philosophy, but when it's made of plastic and sells for $9.95 with colourful pebbles, someone's gone too far. Think of a Western icon, like a sports car or a cathedral, then reduce it in size, make it of poor quality, and put it on your desk. Now what's it for? It doesn't represent anything it did before, and most of its actual function has disappeared. If I was a Zen Buddhist, that's probably how I'd feel about desktop Zen stone gardens. Mokalus of Borg PS - But then again, if I was a Buddhist, I'd have a different personal philosophy. PPS - So I can't actually say for certain how I'd feel about it all.
My web browser Firefox (and, I would presume, Mozilla proper) has a nifty feature I discovered this morning - keywords for bookmarks that can be parameterised. So, for example, you can define a bookmark to Google in a certain way, give it a keyword, and then search just by typing "google frogs" in the address bar. (Not that you would do that , however, since Firefox has a built-in search box, too.) The second part of the puzzle is our web proxy running here at work. It extensive and over-paranoid site blocking, but does save us heaps of bandwidth on banner ads. Still, some sites are blocked unfairly, and a way around the proxy for those sites would be good. I found a way around it by using Google translation - tell it to translate from English to English, and the proxy is blind. I've memorised the URL prefix to append to any blocked site to view it via this method. Parameterised keyword bookmarks seemed like a perfect way to avoid typing the longish URL prefix, so I gave it a go. I defined a parameterised keyword bookmark, found a blocked site, and typed my keyword before the URL in the address bar. Firefox couldn't handle all the dots and slashes as part of a parameter and fell flat on its face. Sigh. Mokalus of Borg PS - I don't think I'll file a bug report. PPS - For all I know, this is by design.
On the Blogger main page at the moment is a link to "Blindfold Blog" - a blog written by Ann Marie, who is apparently training to be a Guide Dog trainer. Confused yet? Anyway, as part of her training, she had to spend ten days blindfolded and working with a trained dog, to get an inside perspective. I found it really interesting, especially the blindfold removal on day 10. I've seen documentaries of people with restored sight, too, and I think it's fascinating to observe people learning to use their eyes again (or for the first time). I think learning is one of the most interesting phenomena to observe in this world. Mokalus of Borg PS - Almost forgot the urlLink link . PPS - Silly me, forget me own head next, etc. etc.
I can't help but think that Captain Picard was laughing on the inside every time he called Riker "Number 2". "Make it so, Number 2." Hehe. I called him "poopie". Eh? Eh? [crickets chirping] Mokalus of Borg PS - Well, at the very least, it might have taken Patrick Stewart a few days to learn to say it without smirking. PPS - Or maybe he's not that childish. What do I know?
The last, final, absolutely never again meeting for the church fair was last night, where I presented my final report and bowed out. That's it. No more. People there seemed to be assuming I'd be taking the job again next year. Not on your life. As with everything, it seems less stressful in hindsight, but I must remember that my time spent planning this fair was full of stress and pain. I did not enjoy it, and I'm extremely happy it's over. Mokalus of Borg PS - I will, however, be around to give advice to the next coordinator. PPS - I won't be actually doing anything.
Every minute of every day we leave behind the person we once were. Change is not just inevitable - it is essential. Without change, there is no growth. Without growth, we cannot adapt. If we cannot adapt, we spend more time trying to change our environment. Eventually all of our time is taken and we have none left to live in. The world will change whether you want it to or not. As long as you live here you will have to make peace with change. Mokalus of Borg PS - So it is with software, too. You must design for change. PPS - Because, frankly, your users will change their minds EVERY. FRICKIN'. DAY.
I met Emily at AGMF in Toowoomba over the Easter weekend. I haven't seen her since then and, although I could technically get in contact with her, I won't push for it. Call me crazy (I would) but I'm sure it's better this way. I don't really trust that we felt anything real for each other, and I'm probably already reading way too much into it. I do that, by the way. Mokalus of Borg PS - One weekend, one day, only a few hours, really. PPS - I'd better let it go.
I'd like to think that all I needed to get over my little funk was the good sleep I got last night, but I suspect that's not the case. Oh, well. I did need it, though. I fold paper cranes as part of coping with stress. I have about twenty here at work at the moment, and more at home. It works reasonably well, as long as there are a few other methods in the repertoire. Soon enough I'll have to start walking to the train station to procure my daily Tazo, since the vending machines here are running out, and I haven't seen one in the shops for over a week. Mokalus of Borg PS - I'm looking forward to the weekend. PPS - TGIF.
I'm not sure how it's happening, but lately I've felt very busy all the time. I've been unmotivated and unproductive, and I'd really like to take a week off to just relax. I've got to spend some time by the beach and wake up without an alarm clock for a few days in a row. I don't think I've even been doing that much. Maybe it was just that I didn't get to rest on Sunday as I usually do. Here's hoping I'll be back to normal next week. Mokalus of Borg PS - Of course, I can't tell in advance. PPS - But next week I have other extra-curricular things to do.
I seem to be the only one who can get service with a smile from one particular "sandwich artist" at the local Subway. It seems that everyone else only catches her in a bad mood, but I see her smile and even occasionally sing. For now, the phenomenon is considered coincidence, but if the pattern is observed to continue, we may be forced to conduct experiments. Mokalus of Borg PS - Yes, we do know it's the same person. PPS - I'll be going there today.
"You have a harem!" She kept repeating it, as if trying to come to grips with the idea. She didn't mean a literal harem - it's a joke we have. The group of adoring girls who follows a guy around is what we call his harem. I was the guy who didn't have one, and now it seems I've been catching a few eyes myself. Not many, but enough. It's an ego boost, I guess, and it can be a delicate game to play at times. Mokalus of Borg PS - I'm definitely not complaining. PPS - Because, soon enough, they'll be gone again.
Sometimes life works itself out in the end. Emotions die down over time, shrinking to a point where you can step on them. Sometimes things go better than you could have hoped. Sometimes - just sometimes - everything works out for the best. Mokalus of Borg PS - The content of this post has been abstracted, to protect the innocent. PPS - As much as that is actually possible.
After watching the urlLink Clone Wars cartoons , particularly episodes 12 and 13, I have to say that the Jedi are some of the coolest characters ever created. Fending off laser blasts almost absently and defeating droid armies single-handed and without a weapon definitely ranks among the most impressive feats undertaken by a fictional character. Mokalus of Borg PS - I was once briefly known as Jedi Master Jolt-Ko La. PPS - And one web page named me Jedi Nicjo Brbri. I don't take either name seriously.
We are very slowly developing a running joke at work about time estimates. One of the guys who used to work here gave an estimate for a job of "three days", by himself. That work has now been going on for about six months with three people working on it. Today, I have turned it into a slogan: Three Days One Man No Way Mokalus of Borg PS - No wonder managers get frustrated with software projects. PPS - And programmers get frustrated doing database cleansing.
For some of us, it would be far better to do away with all weekly/monthly/yearly service charges and have those costs absorbed into transaction charges. For example, instead of paying $40 a month for dial-up Internet access with a limited free bandwidth and a charge per megabyte over that, you'd just pay a small fee per megabyte and no monthly fee. Your bank would not charge you account-keeping fees, but each deposit, withdrawal and transfer would cost you a tiny amount - that is, if your bank is petty enough to charge at all. Your cable television service would provide all channels without question, but you'd be charged a few cents per hour for what you watch, and just settle up at the end of the month. The only barrier standing in the way of this microcharge service model is the greed of big companies. For most of us, the microcharge model would work out cheaper, which means less money going into big pockets. The unacceptable answer is to charge more per transaction, at which point customers balk at the thought. Also, the model only works well for small consumers. To high-volume customers, such as mid-sized companies, monthly fees work out better than microcharges. That can be incorporated into the model with high-volume plans that charge only a regular flat fee that would probably be slightly higher than current service charges. Mokalus of Borg PS - Economics is fun. PPS - I learned all the economics I needed to know in two weeks.
After watching 50 First Dates and remembering The Wedding Singer , I get the feeling that perhaps Adam Sandler has started to make movies purely for the chance to show off his songwriting. Mokalus of Borg PS - I won't really start to worry until it seems that the movies are written to fit the songs. PPS - I'm a bit uncertain whether that happened in 50 First Dates .
I remember one Christmas when I was younger - I forget how old, and I can't reason it out - one of the stocking-stuffer gifts I got from Santa was a pair of very low-quality plastic scissors. In an extremely uncharacteristic action, I decided they were worthless and destroyed them. Now, these scissors were just about the worst and cheapest scissors you could ever find, and they probably would have lasted about a week if I'd used them. Even all these years later I feel a little guilty for breaking them on purpose, although their total value probably amounted to about fifty cents. I don't know why I should still remember it, let alone feel anything about it. Mokalus of Borg PS - This has been yet another introspective psychological insight (tm). PPS - I still don't know what I'll do on Sunday.
Do you ever have that experience when you think you've got it all sorted out and are about to make your move, then the whole game changes? Human relationships can do this. The way forward is never clear. I don't want to mention names or specific details, which makes this a little harder to express, but I'll give it a go. There are three hearts involved, and one of them is mine. There is the same very good reason that I must reject both, and one has already rejected that reason, forcing me to come up with something else by Sunday. I will have to deal with both on Sunday, which is just the final little twist. Did I blink? Has it always been this complicated? It would be good to have some advice on the issue. Mokalus of Borg PS - My argument on Sunday will have three solid points designed to make her abandon the whole idea. PPS - It will fail, because she is blinded.
This coming Sunday I will have to choose whether I am a bastard or a hypocrite. That's what it boils down to, and that's probably why I'm having a tough time deciding. Neither is better than the other, and I cause problems either way. It's definitely not something I can or should run from. I do not envy anyone these kinds of choices. The damage is already done, it's just waiting to be unleashed, and I must decide which way I direct it. I absorb some of the damage either way. I can handle that. My concern is the collateral damage I'll cause. Mokalus of Borg PS - Curse these non-threatening good looks! PPS - How does life get so much harder when there are other people involved?
One of the things I like about programming computers is this: if you can't find the tools to do the job, you can make them yourself. In software there is no difference between the tools you use and the programs you write with them. So if you need, say, a personal organiser and what you can find doesn't suit your needs, you can write one that does. There are any number of programs I've thought about writing for exactly this reason. Usually it turns out someone else has done it for me, which is one of the things I like about the Internet. But that's another post for another day. Mokalus of Borg PS - I forgot to mention urlLink Alabaster Box and urlLink Blind in yesterday's post. PPS - I also saw them at AGMF both this year and last year.
Over the Easter weekend I camped out in Queens Park, Toowoomba, for the urlLink Australian Gospel Music Festival , and had an excellent time. Besides seeking out ska, rock and a little pop (not too much) I managed to take in a set from Christian metal band urlLink Fearscape . It's extremely bizarre to see a band talk about Jesus in between songs that sound like that. Still, they do good work, and fill a niche in the Christian music scene for anyone who prefers their music heavy. Really heavy. I caught urlLink Gerald , as I always do, and urlLink Crying Out Loud and urlLink Sounds Like Chicken immediately afterwards. I saw urlLink Rookie twice, and I'm now officially a fan. urlLink Rebecca St James on Saturday was excellent, as were urlLink The Lads and urlLink eLi . I saw a set by urlLink Claire Hazzard , too, which was very good. I saw bits of other bands and probably some other full sets, too, but I've rambled on quite enough. I met many interesting people who all liked my hat, and saw the kind of fashion sense that only comes out at festivals and raves. It's great to see people so free to express themselves, and I love to do that myself, too. I just wish it was a little more acceptable day-to-day. I left on Sunday night after eLi, which meant I missed urlLink Propane , the last band to play the festival this year. I'll get a report from someone, I'm sure. Mokalus of Borg PS - There are two things that would make the festival complete: soap and hot showers with a little privacy. PPS - I didn't wash for the whole weekend, and I'm sure I started getting sick.
It's getting a bit harder to keep up my habit of acquiring a new Yu-Gi-Oh Tazo disc every day. The chips in which they are distributed seem to be disappearing. This morning all I could find in the shop were Burger Rings. The other chips all had Crash Bandicoot Stunt Wheels in them - which I do not care about in the slightest. I wonder what I'll do when I can no longer find any more to buy? I'm sure my collection will be incomplete, and as I have only one fellow collector to swap with, it will likely remain incomplete. I don't even know why I care. Mokalus of Borg PS - My Life (tm) is apparently as exciting as this. PPS - Perhaps I'll go watch the grass grow at lunchtime.
He woke with the sun, eased out of bed, and picked up the horse's head that had appeared beside him in the night. With a sigh, he threw it out the window onto the growing pile. Frankly, he'd be worried if he didn't wake up next to yet another horse's head. He dressed, being careful first to remove the poisoned needles from the sleeves of his coat, then walked downstairs. He carefully stepped over the missing step and avoided using the railing that had been sawed almost, but not quite, completely off. He prepared a quick breakfast, avoiding the wide selection of poisoned foods, and boiled some water for coffee. As he took a sip and ducked a crossbow bolt that came flying in through his window, he sensed it was going to be one of those days. Mokalus of Borg PS - This is probably most directly inspired by the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork and the Assassin's Guild. PPS - These are both from the Discworld books.
In the modern view of the mythical Cupid, we seem to have lost sight of the fact that he was a mischievous bastard. He's not working to make people fall in love, he's working to make trouble through misguided infatuation. How often have your own romantic involvements gotten so confused that they can't be called "triangle" in even the most liberal sense? At the moment I have chains and side-tracks along with any number of good excuses as to why each arrow points only one way. The tangled graph grows and shrinks, and all of us are just waiting to see a little spark in return. I don't know if we'll ever figure it out. Mokalus of Borg PS - It all seems so much smaller when it's written down. PPS - It's still just as hard to handle, though.
As part of the Windows XP development, Microsoft hired a lot of people to look at interfaces and usability. I know this because Tyler knows this. It's paid off, too. I'd rather not sound like an advertisement or MS propaganda, so I won't go on a long spiel about how much the Windows interface has improved. I'll just say that I'd like to congratulate Microsoft for finally getting properly behind usability, because that's what computers are supposed to be about. We should be looking toward a world where nobody needs to be trained to operate a computer, because it's so simple, or even invisible. That's still a long way off, of course. Mokalus of Borg PS - But we're getting there. Slowly. PPS - "Computer! Publish now!"
Y'know what? Today I've got nothing I want to share. I could talk about television I watched last night, or how my new PC is coming along nicely, or even about the borderline-inappropriate discussions last night at supper after church, but I won't. And I don't have much to offer in the way of introspection, either. The continuing slow building of my Tazo collection is hardly news or exciting, and I have no software design thoughts to offer yet. Maybe I'll try to get some inspiration from Slashdot. Be right back. Okay, it seems there's some lake under Antarctica that's completely cut off from the rest of the Earth, and scientists hope to dig into it to prove there is life there. Which there very likely is, considering what they've found in the ice above it. This will allow them once again to crow that extra-terrestrial life is possible, and probably fund a robotic excursion to Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. But of course there's life in a lake on Earth . It's EARTH - you know, where the life comes from? You live there? I'm sick of scientists wasting their time looking for aliens. The main reason they think it's possible is that they assume life is evolving from nothing all over the universe. I disagree, and I'm willing to wait for time to prove me right. This opinion of mine is one of the reasons I like Red Dwarf. In the Red Dwarf books and television series, Earth is the one planet on which life existed to begin with. Genetically-engineered lifeforms, robots and so forth are widespread, but every single one can be traced back to Earth. It is phrased most poignantly in the books. I highly recommend them. Mokalus of Borg PS - In space, no-one can hear you scream. PPS - Mostly because there is no-one else there.
Now that it's all over, I can relax again. The church fair came and went with little incident, though I had underplanned, as usual. On the day, I was missing the following items: Eskis and ice for prizes The equipment for two stalls Some of the equipment for two other stalls Several workers A radio to stay in contact with other organisers Well, we managed to find one large eski and a small cooler, plus ice, as well as improvise for the partially-missing equipment. I cut my losses on the two missing stalls and used their staff to shore up the numbers on other stalls. I made do without a radio, too. I don't know the figures yet, so I can't say whether I got my section to break even or not. What I know for sure is that all my stress vanished the second after the fair closed for the day. I'm so glad it's all over. Now I just have to write a report. That's much less stressful and has only minor consequences if it's late. Mokalus of Borg PS - These have surely been Interesting Times. PPS - Today's recommended reading is the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett.
Last night I had a mole cut out, because it got in my way, so to speak. It was sitting right on my belt line, and for years it's been rubbing raw and healing, then rubbing raw again. I'd had enough, so I had it cut out. It actually scared me a bit, because it's the first time anyone's taken a scalpel to me for any reason, including threats. The procedure itself didn't hurt, because of the anaesthetic, but there's been a dull ache and an itch there ever since. The stitches are staying in until after Easter, which is a bit longer than usual. Mokalus of Borg PS - Or so the doctor tells me. PPS - And why would he lie?
My new PC is now up and running with all its basic software installed, and very little else. I took it for a test drive last night, not looking for a benchmark or anything, just seeing if it would work. After installing video drivers and DVD player software, I spun up Eddie Izzard's " Dress to Kill ", a recording of a stand-up comedy show he did in San Francisco. I only got through a third of it, because it was getting late. The only troubles I had with hardware were the floppy drive (recycled from an old 486, it seems to be dead) and the keyboard that I mentioned earlier. I think I've figured the keyboard out now, and I don't need a floppy drive right away, so I'll call it complete for now. Mokalus of Borg PS - I could still use more desk space. PPS - Today's urlLink wirewater is an iced coffee Big M.
A few times per day I get email from Big Accountant Guy (who some of you may remember). His emails are easy to distinguish from others, because they are all written entirely in the subject header and always go to everyone. They're not for everyone, just delivered to everyone. And that's the problem. It's much easier for him to write "To all job leaders remember today is invoicing day I need to do timesheets" and send it to everyone than to hunt down a list of current job leaders. Even if there was a single address to which he could send such messages, he'd have to remember which address it was, and he already knows one that will guarantee delivery to all those people. So: there is a broadcast solution available when narrowcast (delivering the message only to those it affects) would be more appropriate. The cost of broadcast is smaller than the cost of narrowcast, unless you consider the negative PR cost associated with broadcast. You can take one second to send a specific message to everyone, even if it's only intended for a few of them, and everyone else will be annoyed for a few seconds, or you can take five minutes to send your message only to its intended recipients and not annoy anyone at all. The cost you immediately see is your time, so to hell with everyone else. Mokalus of Borg PS - This is not an attitude I condone. PPS - Not just because it affects me negatively.
I just got driven home by the most ornery bus driver in Brisbane. It's not really that he's openly hostile, but if you want to ride on his bus, you'd better have a damn good excuse. Don't try to use even a pre-paid concession ticket without a concession ID, and God help you if you want to buy a ticket and need change. If he forgets to open the back door for you, you'd just better hoof it on up to the front before he drives off again. If he doesn't stop when you ding the bell, that's because he doesn't like your face. I almost get the feeling this guy drives over puppies on purpose, and for fun. I remember him from my university days. No matter how long it took, or how much of a rush you were in to get to your lecture/tutorial/exam/date, he'd meticulously compare each picture ID with the presenting patron. I never saw him refuse entry, but did see him take issue with one or two cards. Some bus drivers get thanked after the journey. I'll give you three guesses whether this driver is one of those. Some of my friends claim to have met the "Singing Bus Driver" who is all smiles and pleasantness to everyone on board, and belts out show tunes at the top of his talented lungs for the duration of the trip. With all the busses I've caught over the years, I'd think that, at least once, my driver would turn out to be Happy and not Grumpy. Mokalus of Borg PS - This is the first time I've seen this bus driver in a while. PPS - I hope it's the last in just as long.
Every time I hear a mobile phone ring loudly, especially if it's wrangler is not present, I imagine smashing it into dust with a brick. It usually makes me feel better. Mokalus of Borg PS - I hear these sounds in the office far too often. PPS - Especially for a place whose policy is that mobile phones are off during work hours.
There are no Jedi and, furthermore, you are not Luke Skywalker. What is it about our lives that makes us seek fantasy? Is it the realisation that we are as boring as everyone else, or is it that increasingly unreal movies have created a thirst for the life less ordinary? It's probably both. Whether we just want to go on holiday or have adventures on a starship in a galaxy far, far away, we all seem to have some desire to shake off the dust of this one-horse town, so to speak. The rut we dig ourselves into, before it gets too deep to see, becomes uncomfortable, and we look to hoist ourselves out and start something fresh. No harm in that, I suppose - neophilia has served to inspire many people. The problems come when we stay away and don't bring back our stories and lessons to the everyday world. Mokalus of Borg PS - I am now about a third of the way through reading " urlLink The Last Command ". PPS - And I may be having a little trouble telling fantasy from reality.
I've been reading Fight Club (for the uncivilised, it was a book before it was a movie) and the differences between the book and the movie are interesting. In the movie, the narrator's "Zen Master" phase was practically just mentioned in passing. In the book, he sticks with it a bit longer. He thinks in haiku to calm down. He says he gets ZEN in everyone's FACE, and writes it just like that. I get the impression that our modern Western culture is becoming Buddhist by default. Not a true Buddhist culture, of course, because we're still consumerist Westerners and the true Buddhist elimination of desire would mean we all should give up our credit cards and stop lusting after the latest combination mobile phone/MP3 player/GPS device/waffle iron. So what exactly are we taking from Buddhism? Perhaps part of the reason our post-Christian society is leaning that way is because firstly, if you are a Buddhist, you are on a path, and are expected to be working it out rather than have it all worked out already. Secondly, it might be that nothing seems to be wrong in Buddhism: there are no commandments and no laws. No "Thou Shalt Not". Well, there are , but they're more like suggestions. All in all, society is gradually embracing Buddhism because we're all too afraid to admit we actually believe in anything. Mokalus of Borg PS - I am not a Buddhist. PPS - As such, I probably have a misguided idea of the Buddhist philosophy. Much like you do, unless you are a Buddhist.
Because I seem to be socially maladjusted, my interactions with other people can seem strained at best and non-existent at worst. Last night during a long session at the local coffee establishment with many acquaintances, I felt particularly lonely, and wondered why. My current working theory is that I am tired and overworked, which means I'm unable to focus on anything for long - let alone the social interactions I usually find so taxing. Could that be why so many of us feel more alone in the cities than residents of quieter towns claim to feel? Maybe not - I already have a theory about that. When we have thousands of people from which to pick and choose our friends, we don't have to be nice to everyone we meet, and end up being snarled at by most of the strangers we encounter. When there are only so many friends to go around, we need them all, and we are nice to everyone, which in turn creates a generally positive feeling in the community. We have lost our community existence. A friend of mine - a youth worker - said that the basic unit of society used to be the village. Then it was the extended family. Then the nuclear family. Now it is the individual. Soon it will be the fragments of the individual. Mokalus of Borg PS - Sometimes, I can hear it emerging already. PPS - Where will we be left when we can't even form a cohesive whole of ourselves?
Last night I went out to dinner with some friends to a Chinese restaurant in Fortitude Valley called "Superbowl". I'd never been before, and Our Fearless Leader for the night had assured me the portions were quite large. We still needed 10 mains and 3 barrels of rice to fill 12 people, though. I'd definitely go again. Also, yesterday, one of my workmates held one of my paper cranes for ransom. I didn't realise it would upset me until it happened. It only mattered because it was the green one - all the rest are white. Mokalus of Borg PS - I wanted to cover his desk in cranes in response. PPS - But I only had time to fold four. I lead a busy life.
I did the weekly grocery shopping last night because I won't have time to do it tonight (it's usually done on Thursday). My Tazo addiction showed itself again: I bought two packets of Stix just for the Tazos even though my collection is missing only five of the discs I could possibly find there. I have to call it an addiction now, because it's possible I'll just throw the chips out and keep the Tazo. Mokalus of Borg PS - If only all of life's problems were this petty and small. PPS - But in that case, I can imagine there would be more of them.
An unfortunate combination of factors has recently cut my internet time at home down to virtually zero. To summarise, we have cable internet service now, and because it's an "always-on" connection, I installed a firewall program. This firewall program does not support Windows internet connection sharing, which was previously being used to connect two PCs to the net via one modem. Thus, until I find another solution, we are stuck with exactly one PC on the internet. Now enter the second factor: the online game Final Fantasy XI, which has captured my brother's attention and much of his time. Mix in a bit of irregular sleep patterns from him, and I have to beg and plead just to get an hour online at home. In addition to all that, any time I do get online I am usually interrupted every five minutes by the questions "Are you done yet?" and "How long will you be?". Mokalus of Borg PS - I'm sure it's a really good game. PPS - It had better be.
I spent an hour and a half last night watching the bad movie "Rollerball". I probably should have gone to bed on time instead. I got the impression that the plot had been sucked dry long before anyone got pen to paper, and the whole thing felt rushed (not surprising, considering the short length). One thing that did impress me, though, was the night-time car chase that was actually filmed at night with infra-red cameras. It wasn't enough to save the movie, but did stand out. Mokalus of Borg PS - Current mood: numb. PPS - It's my blog and "numb" can be a mood if I want it to.
In the absence of another love interest, I'm returning to someone who's already rejected me. She'd kill me for thinking this way, and to make things worse, I told her I was over her. I'm remembering little things I learned about her, too - some of them made me sad. I really can't be more specific in a public blog. Mokalus of Borg PS - She's a wonderful person, inside and out. PPS - Why would I do this to myself?
Here's a paraphrased summary of an email I just received: Hello everyone, I've been using your new software for a month and it sucks. I just tried it on a brand-new fast PC and it still sucks. I couldn't generate a report because you suck. The current software doesn't suck nearly as much as you do. Your software is way too slow, which sucks, and you need to make it fast before we spend any more money on it. Your software sucks because it's not like what I have right now. Even if you work really hard, I think it will still suck. Big Accountant Guy To be fair, the report generation is slow. To bite back, I have a few points: The computer that actually needs upgrading is the server, not his desktop The previous software is far more limited than our reporting engine and only generates pieces of the report on demand Big Accountant Guy thinks the old software is fast because it only generates a hundredth of the data and returns that, then gets the next hundredth when he asks for that. Mokalus of Borg PS - If we don't get this fixed, the project could be axed. PPS - On the plus side, that would mean I don't have to deal with accountants for a while.
I did the weekly grocery shopping last night (only because Dad, who usually does it, is in Russia) and I hardly had to buy anything. I think it's because all our family friends assume that my brother and I can't feed ourselves, so we've been supplied with free ready-cooked meals all week. I think I'd rather be cooking, if only because I perpetuate the idea by accepting the meals. Mokalus of Borg PS - I'm even finding it tough to get through all the food we've been given. PPS - I may be buying a car soon, for less than I expected to pay.
After exhausting the Tazo supply in the suburb where I work, I have now located a new supply in the central business district. We're back in the collecting business, baby! Mokalus of Borg PS - I definitely need a life. PPS - But for now, this will do.
Browsing through urlLink Mini-ITX.com , I'm often struck by the thought that this is how computers should look. I'm sick of beige (or black or silver) boxes with giant monitors, cables everywhere and ugly peripherals. Computers are meant to be tiny, powerful and, if they're visible, they should be pleasing to the eye. Ideally, your computer should integrate so well with your house (or other habitat) that it is entirely invisible and you hardly notice it. Failing that, it should at least look good. I doubt there are many computer manufacturers worldwide who aim to make their cases out of polished wood or in truly appealing shapes that differ from the standard box. Mokalus of Borg PS - Perhaps Apple are the innovators here. PPS - I feel so dirty for saying that.
A challenge I thought I'd throw out to everyone: order take-away pizza with names of characters from movies or books, or celebrity names, and keep an absolutely straight face when the person behind the counter calls out "Pick up for Gollum?". A few names to get you started: David Beckham Charles Manson Mary Poppins Arthur Dent Harry Potter Gandalf the White Wizard Mokalus of Borg PS - Extra points for showing up in costume. PPS - I have never tried this myself.
I've stayed home sick from work today, because I'm coughing up yellow stuff and have no energy. I've basically slept until now, but it's definitely time to be up and about, even if I don't leave the house. Mokalus of Borg PS - Perhaps I'll try to find my Star Wars video. PPS - Link for the day is urlLink a friend at Livejournal .
Yesterday I went to the Lion's Den Cafe to see Half Way Out, and also saw The Simpletons (who poked fun at the fashion style known as 'emo') and a ska band whose name I can't remember (who did a great cover of the Captain Planet theme song). I skanked through the whole Half Way Out set, so I was dripping with sweat by the end. It was a great time. Mokalus of Borg PS - I just would have liked to stick around for Crying Out Loud. PPS - It was probably my last chance to see them play for ages.
It's unusual for me to post on a weekend, but this morning has left me with something to say. My father left for Russia today, to go visit a missionary and help build playgrounds with some other members of the church. I won't see him for two and a half weeks. The odd thing about this is that when we said goodbye, we shook hands. It was more of a farewell between acquainted adults than a father-son interaction. I guess we're not close, and I always knew it, but it's not something you want driven home quite so obviously. Mokalus of Borg PS - I got up at 04:30 to see him off, and I haven't gone back to bed since. PPS - I'll be tired on Monday for sure.
I'm a fan of the Brisbane ska-rock band urlLink Gerald , and have been for a while. Recently, though, I think I made the jump from casual fan (and friend of two members) to scary groupie. I think it was at AGMF this year that I crossed over, at least in the mind of the band. It was the second Gerald show I'd been to in just over a week, and I saw Ben, Dave and Adam talking to someone outside afterwards. I said "Hey, guys. Good set." and kept walking, but thought a second later "Man, what kind of freak am I?". See, it had occurred to me that I'm a non-musician using music lingo who actually has nothing to say to the band, and I still said it. Mokalus of Borg PS - My motivation behind the spontaneous remark can only be the mild insanity of a groupie. PPS - Then again, maybe I'm over-analysing things just a bit.
There are a few things you should and should not do when you are attempting to catch a bus home after a long day of work. For easier digestion, I shall present them here in point form. 1. Leave work with enough time to get to the bus stop without rushing. 2. If you bump into a friend on your way to the stop, keep your conversation brief, even if she is cute. 3. When your bus arrives, even if you're rushed, take a few seconds to check whether it is the right bus. 4. If you happen to get on the wrong bus, get off as soon as possible instead of waiting on board "just in case" it gets closer to your destination instead of dumping you in the middle of bloody nowhere. By following these simple rules, as I usually do, you can avoid the embarrassment of calling home and trying not to use the words "wrong bus" within earshot of the other passengers. Mokalus of Borg PS - No matter how often we do something right, we just might do it wrong next time. PPS - I dub this "Mokalus's Rule of Practiced Idiocy".
It's been a while since I had a Tuesday night free. Last night I used it to play Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. Every time I looked at the clock I was surprised by how long it had been since I looked last. I'm very grateful for the KI device from the expansion pack, because it allows me to export and import screenshots to carry around. I don't need to take paper notes anymore - I take digital photographs in the game, make some notes on them with Paint, and return to the game. It's all too easy. Mokalus of Borg PS - Well, even though I say "easy", I've actually only completed two out of four Ages. PPS - And I'm sure I've been everywhere I can in one of the other two.
I think I'm overdue for a proper holiday. Long weekends are good, if you can spend them relaxing. I seem to choose to spend them with friends in long sessions. I can't turn down an invitation to hang out watching movies and playing console games, but my body would much rather rest. I'm a bit divided between being an introvert and an extrovert - I can't tell whether I recharge by myself or by being with others. It seems that when the company is really good and prolonged I feel great afterwards, or when I get as much time as I need to just sleep in and relax, doing nothing, I also feel good. It's this sort of in-between socialising that drains me. Seeing my friends in short bursts throughout the week just wears me down. I need something different. I need more than a day (perhaps more than a weekend) with people I love, or I need to be by myself for just as long. Mokalus of Borg PS - Sometimes I'm not sure if I know myself at all. PPS - And then I get too busy to notice anymore.
The other day I saw my first episode of "Faking It". The basic premise of the show is to take a person out of their regular job and give them a crash course in something completely different. Then they place the impostor alongside a few genuine articles and get a panel of judges to see if they can spot the phoney. The episode I saw had a New York lawyer transformed into a pro wrestler by the name of "Psycho T". Usually I'm opposed to all things pro wrestling, but I do respect the amount of physical ability these performers have. I love the idea of showing just how adaptable human beings are. You can rip a person out of their day-to-day routine and put them in a completely new situation for just a few weeks, and they're already adapting. Give it a year of the same treatment and I think you'd find the transformation to be just about complete. Mokalus of Borg PS - "Psycho T" fooled 2 of the 3 judges. PPS - I think he got to keep his mullet hair extensions.
This is getting a bit nuts right here: urlLink MSNBC - Cloning pets: In search of Fluffy 2.0 . I know you can love a pet very much, and I know you can want to have them back, but you always get over it eventually when they die. What happens when "Fluffy 2.0" dies? We'll probably clone it again. And again. Hell, we could have the same pet for our entire lifetime, and never have to deal with loss or death - ever! Mokalus of Borg PS - I'd say your processing fee would be much better spent on a new pet, especially one from the pound. PPS - Give a real animal a home instead of holding down the fort until your photocopy comes back.
Yesterday I got to see firsthand just how terrified of public speaking my Dad is. He had to stand up in church and talk about his trip to Russia. About halfway through, it started to sound like he had no tongue. Apparently, his mouth had dried up completely. I think it's because he was standing there thinking "I really don't want to be up here talking right now", and his body just kind of granted his wish. I thought it was hilarious. Then he had to do it again in the evening. Mokalus of Borg PS - The air conditioning in the office is currently turning on and off loudly every ten seconds or so. PPS - Feels like some bizarre experiment.
urlLink This is an high school buddy of mine who's been working on Big Brother season 4 here in Oz. I hadn't been watching the "Up Late" show, mostly because, well, it's late, it's two hours long, and I start work at 8 every weekday morning. This, of course, has prodded me to watch the Thursday night show at least. Mokalus of Borg PS - I probably wouldn't have found out unless he told me via email. PPS - The intruder he mentions in urlLink this poem is urlLink Miriam .
It's a strange mentality I've observed now and then: the idea that, when a misunderstanding is occurring, each party needs to keep talking over the other to make sure their point of view is being communicated. Of course, all it creates is the impression that the other party is not listening, thus is not getting the message, and thus needs to be talked at more or louder. I think it stems from a desire not just to express yourself, but to be heard . Nobody wants to feel like their opinion is worthless, and unless you have a large audience hanging on your every word, it could feel a bit empty. Two ears. One mouth. Shut up and listen once in a while. ;) Mokalus of Borg PS - I don't think I usually sound this disagreeable. PPS - I am prepared to listen to your feedback calmly and quietly.
I think we are gradually moving towards the production of a tricorder-like device as our standard all-in-one mobile information and communications manager. Mobile phones and PDAs are gradually merging into one spectrum of computing power on communications and organisation devices. As for the Real Trek Experience, I doubt many of us would need atmospheric scanners, geiger counters or geological survey equipment on our handhelds. Perhaps they'd be add-on accessories for the die-hard weirdo. What most of us would like or employ on a regular basis would probably be about the same as what we have now, just to a greater degree, with a more powerful computer back-end and more available. Mokalus of Borg PS - So I guess I'm hanging out for the Nokia Tricorder 4215. PPS - Or perhaps the Palm Tricorder III.
Compare these photos of commedian urlLink Jonathon Atherton and documentary film-maker urlLink Morgan Spurlock . Similar? That's only a little bit odd, but take into account that I've known at least three other people who look just like this, and I'm sure there are more. I'm starting to gain more sympathy for Terry Pratchett's theory that there are only a certain number of people in the world, and you keep meeting the same ones over and over, no matter where you go. So what's the explanation for all these lookalikes? Were they all cut from the same celestial mould, or is there some kind of natural shaping force at work that makes our faces and bodies gravitate towards a certain pre-defined set of looks, with fewer of bodies than there are people? Mokalus of Borg PS - Is God not as creative as we thought? PPS - I think it's possible He's just funnier than we thought.
I've been watching Big Brother (Australian season 4) and I've once again been struck by a desire to be in there myself. I'd say most of it is fuelled by a desire for attention, popularity and love (though I'd trade "a legion of adoring fans" for "love" if required). Let me try to explain the problem: It takes a long time to get to know me properly (which is probably the case with everyone). By the time girls know me well enough to think I'm a decent relationship prospect, they're my good friends who are unwilling or unable to hook up. In BB, I think I'd be separated from the part where we become friends, and thus avoid that glitch in the process. Mokalus of Borg PS - It's so simple it's foolproof. PPS - And we all know what they say about foolproof plans.
(If you'll excuse me, I'm going to get a bit sarcastic now) The difference between "proof" and "insistence" is known as "evidence". For instance, I have heard you on the radio this morning saying: "The reason I keep saying there was a connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda is that there was a connection." This is despite the recent report finding that there was no collaboration between the two. This is an "insistence", and is empty. A "proof" would sound more like this: "The reason I keep saying there was a connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda is that we found the following evidence to support that theory..." See the difference? In the second case, you have some kind of basis for arguing, whereas the first provides only evidence of your own stubbornness. Mokalus of Borg PS - I don't want to get political here too often. PPS - This post is not about politics, but rather about frustrating people.
I've never been fond of static electric shocks, like when you've been walking on shaggy carpet on a dry day then you touch a doorknob and feel that zap. I hate it. Apparently, to some people, static shocks are tiny sparks that practically tickle. The ones I get are their big brothers, complete with bad haircut and missing teeth, ready to beat you up for your lunch money. They singe the hairs on the backs of my hands. I've felt like I'm standing in front of some tiny dark Jedi who hurls bolts of lightning at me. To counteract this, I've developed a habit of touching every metal object I can find. And I mean everything - doorframes, filing cabinets, cubicle divider joins and that metal plate in that one guy's head. By doing this, I seem to have stemmed the constant onslaught of electricity that flows my way. Mokalus of Borg PS - Instructional video on sale now. PPS - Just $19.99!
Most of the current jokes around the office are revolving around zombies thanks to movies like urlLink Dawn of the Dead and urlLink 28 Days Later . We have, for the moment, fixated on the zombies' limited vocabulary, resulting in an over-use of the word "brains" around here. Some topics of discussion so far have included: Zombie Wheel of Fortune What's for lunch? Zombie cooking shows Zombie grammar classes Zombie usernames and passwords The "Thunderbirds" character called Brains Much hilarity ensues. Mokalus of Borg PS - The "what's for lunch" question is one that pops up every single day. PPS - Perhaps we should be working instead.
I have a TV tuner in my PC that lets it act like a television, radio and VCR. Last night I set it to record a TV program, as I do, and I'd been using it to listen to radio. When I came back home I'd found that it had recorded an hour and a half of radio instead of television. I guess telling the program to record television wasn't a clear enough signal that I wanted it to actually record a television signal . If it was an intelligent program, I could blame it for waking up and thinking "Right, I'm supposed to record television, but I'm in radio mode. I can't find the TV channel on the radio, so I'll just record radio instead". I can't blame it, because it didn't know what it was doing. The person I can blame is the programmer who forgot to write the software in such a way that it would switch from radio to TV if it's supposed to record a TV signal. So I do. Mokalus of Borg PS - Now I've got an email to write. PPS - It might not be nasty. Maybe.
"Today we're doing nothing at all" - urlLink Cat Empire: Nothing I've got the day off work today because it's the Queen's birthday. Well, not really, but we say it's now just so we don't have to change the date every time we throw out a monarch for a fresh one. Now I'm going back to bed, just because. Mokalus of Borg PS - The Queen's Birthday holiday is one of the reasons we (Australia) voted to stay in the Commonwealth. PPS - A nation of lazy sods, that's us!
It's one thing to believe that I may be unattractive. It's quite another to obtain mathematical proof. According to the "golden ratio" and people who have studied it, my left eye is half a centimetre too low and my legs are 8 centimetres too short. The eye thing makes my face asymmetrical, which is unattractive. Still, as much as I'd like to blame my romantic failures on such mathematical principles that are outside my control, I know I must accept some responsibility for the fact. I meet nobody. I interact poorly. Frankly, I scare people, and not like a rollercoaster or a slasher movie. I mean like discovering a severed head in your freezer. Sometimes I'm okay with it. Sometimes, like now, I'm overtired and everything is just that little bit more intense. This time, for real, I need a couple of days off work. Mokalus of Borg PS - I blame Discovery Channel for the knowledge of my physical inadequacies. PPS - This weekend we celebrate the Queen's birthday by taking the day off work. I love this country.
My father, for reasons best known to himself, has purchased a milk-like substance known as "PhysiCAL" and would like us to use it on our cereal from now on. Ug's comment on the subject was that it tastes "like water", and is clearly an inferior substitute. Besides taste deficiencies, the offending liquid also costs more than regular milk and offers only ethereal promises in return. It seems to me that the dairy-phobic industry has yet to produce a milk-substitute that even tastes slightly like actual milk. Perhaps the difference is less pronounced for those of us raised on non-milk substances, but for our family it's always been your standard homogenised, pasteurised full cream. Anything else is the taste equivalent of Cinderella's ugly sisters. Mokalus of Borg PS - The Cinderella thing was the best metaphor I could concoct rapidly. PPS - If I think of a better one, I'll get back to you.
I am currently, as I have been for the past four years, training in karate. To advance to a new belt, besides demonstrating a particular level of all-round proficiency, I must learn two "kata" - complex sequences of stances, blocks and strikes, performed against imaginary opponents. There are three other people in the class who know the kata I need to learn. Two of them teach the class, and their daughter is the third. She's about twelve, I guess. I never found out for sure. Anyway, yesterday I was being taught my kata by a child, and only then did I understand respect. At the beginning and end of every class, we bow as a sign of respect to all the other students in the dojo. In what other context would a man have to respect a child enough to be actively taught by them? To listen when they say "you're doing that wrong"? To believe them when they say "it's better to do it this way"? Mokalus of Borg PS - There is always more to learn. PPS - There are always more ways to improve.
My morning routine has been thrown off for the past couple of days by my Dad sleeping in. He swears he's not suffering jetlag. My brother, Ug, who never changes timezone, is suffering from jetlag. Specifically, "Gamer's Jetlag", also known as "Final Fantasy XI". I'm getting well into Knights of the Old Republic, and I'm already wishing I'd spent my level-up points differently. I could really use some stealth ability right now. So far, although I'm enjoying it, I'm remembering the old adventure gamer's frustration. I know I have to get through that door. I know I need either identity papers or a Sith uniform. I thought I could find someone to help me at the cantina, just because it seems that's where you find shady characters to help you out. So far, I've found a really good way to get hurt and a card player who won't talk about anything else. There's a nut out in the street ranting about aliens and a few shops selling equipment I don't need or can't use. To top things off, every now and then the game tells me that something is bothering my secondary party member, which prompts me to talk to him. Then we have an argument. Mokalus of Borg PS - It's Fun Because LucasArts Said So! PPS - (tm)
I started playing "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" on the weekend. I think it's the first RPG I've played, ever. It got me thinking that this is where adventure games have gone. If you just take away stats and combat, it's a new-school adventure. If adventure gamers want new games, we'd better get used to other genres that provide adventure elements. We'd better be prepared to put up with some action and probably stat-building, too. It can be a good thing. If I was a purist, I'd be screaming at me right now that adventures were the best genre ever, nothing can replace them, etc. Then the other half of me would tell me to shut up and deal. Then maybe a third part would step in, put and end to the fighting and buy us both some cake. And if I was a game developer, I just might sneak in an option to handle stats automatically. We can all get along. Mokalus of Borg PS - My brother, known online as "Ug the Caveman", thought I'd bought a Sims expansion. PPS - And he's been trying to pique my interest in RPGs for years.
I've started to realise that my regular posts here are not always entertaining. That's because I post here every weekday morning and usually have a total of fifteen minutes to think of a topic, compose and post. But neither of us is interested in excuses. I enjoy my writing, and I'd like to think that at least someone else enjoys reading it, so I'm gonna try to kick it up a notch (BAM!) and make my posts more entertaining. One day, I hope to reach a comparable level of greatness to urlLink Tycho at Penny Arcade. Mokalus of Borg PS - Oh, yeah, the entertainment. I'll do it tomorrow. PPS - Or Monday.
Anti-perspirant has never seemed all that effective to me. I apply it every morning and my armpits are dripping by noon. Now I'll grant that it's difficult to create an effective anti-perspirant, because I certainly couldn't do it. What I'd like, though, is one that can at least handle my "strenuous" work of sitting at a desk in air-conditioned comfort. Mokalus of Borg PS - It seems like that , at least, should be fairly simple. PPS - Perhaps I apply it incorrectly?
I'm reading through the entire urlLink Penny Arcade archive at the moment (I'm up to about October 2002) and, besides being very entertaining, it's bringing out the dormant gamer in me. I feel like I should be spending more time and money in Electronics Boutique and such places, sniffing out the best new games and whiling away my precious few leisure moments each day playing them out. Or maybe I should finish Uru first. The point is that I was once a gamer - action, adventure, puzzle and even, God forbid, FPS. Now that I have so little time, I tend to spend it on television instead of games, which is, quite frankly, no good for me at all. Mokalus of Borg PS - At the very least, I should cut back on television. PPS - Starting ... NOW!
What is it about rap and R that makes performers descend into egotism and narcissism? Just about every song that makes it into the charts is essentially the "artist" spewing a stream of self-worshipping drivel. Granted, they do it articulately and in rhyme, but so what? Why the hell do I care if you're so great? Go sing to yourself and leave the rest of us alone. Mokalus of Borg PS - Or, better yet, just stand and stare at yourself in a mirror. PPS - Drooling and puppy-love eyes are optional.
The signalled pedestrian crossings here in Australia, for the most part, include an audible signal as well as the visual "Walk/Don't Walk" sign. We presume this is for blind people, but it could just as easily be a way to weed out those of us without higher-brain functions. I have come to this conclusion because we have been conditioned to start crossing the road when we hear the beeps - a Pavlovian response. The problem comes when the same sound is heard at an intersection for a different direction, which usually means the traffic would run you over if you tried to cross then. I see many people start to take steps when they hear the signal for the wrong crossing, and I've even seen someone start on their way, then run the rest of the way across the road to avoid looking stupid. Personally, I don't think that plan was quite successful, even if he didn't get hurt in the attempt. Mokalus of Borg PS - The safest bet is probably to recondition yourself to cross on the combination of audio and visual signals. PPS - Or just close your eyes and trust to luck.
Birch, Carrol and Coyle gift certificates and pre-purchased discount tickets are (for reasons best known to the money-grubbers themselves) not valid on Saturdays after 5pm. I could almost understand it for the discount ticket books, but arent gift vouchers supposed to be just like store-specific cash? Their prices are also alarming. At Cineplex, the most you will pay for an adult ticket is $AUD7.90. That's absolute maximum - they get cheaper at certain times. At BCC, the only way to get into a movie for the same price is to gather up four hundred and ninety-nine of your closest friends, all with student concession cards, and buy your tickets in bulk. Then you get in for $AUD7.80. If you need adult tickets, it can't be done. The absolute minimum adult ticket price at BCC is $AUD9.00, and that's if you buy ten thousand tickets or more. Mokalus of Borg PS - For mentioning their name in this post, I owe BCC $AU 4.00. PPS - This has been a community service announcement from one cheapskate to whoever is listening.
While reading urlLink the latest P3P working draft I started thinking about online privacy and how it could be enforced by a browser. My first thought is that the browser could just keep a list of personal information that you want to be kept private (so that it's never sent in any outgoing packets at all) or that you want to be warned about. It sounds simple enough, but there are always issues. Two that come to mind are a potentially significant performance hit as the browser scans outgoing packets for personal information, and the local storage of that data which may be vulnerable to cracks and exploits in another branch of the information privacy war. Though I doubt that the majority of the information would be of much use to scanners, email addresses would definitely be among the protected strings, and these are very highly prized by bots. One more possibility is the accidental blocking of legitimate packets that just happen to include blocked strings by accident - a false positive. Mokalus of Borg PS - It's an idea, all the same, even if it's one that could use some work. PPS - It's probably small enough to be made as a browser plug-in.
It's not the best feeling to be outclassed by random street thugs in City of Heroes. Especially when they only attack you in passing. Just running through the city region of King's Row last night, I was beaten two or three times by some kind of zombie surgeons. Don't know their story yet, but when one is dealing with zombies, they rarely have complicated motives. If I had any delusions of grandeur, I was certainly put in my place then. I think my character Dire Sun is getting moderately respectable, but I know there's plenty of room to improve yet. Mokalus of Borg PS - I wonder how many characters players usually end up with? PPS - I have plans for at least three.
I would have liked to stay home sick today. I do have a genuine cold, but it's hardly severe enough to prevent me from working. I'm breathing at about half capacity - my nostrils are taking turns at being blocked up. Anyway, yesterday I started playing urlLink City of Heroes and had spent four hours before I knew it. It's been a while since I've lost my time sense to a game like that. My experience so far has been quite positive, though I've run out of empty enhancement slots in my inventory. I can't use them, can't throw them away, and I can't trade them fast enough. Even if I could, I'd be getting others that I can't use in return. I've really got to find this alleged shop where I can sell them. Mokalus of Borg PS - My first character is known as "Dire Sun". PPS - I forget which server he's on.
On Sunday, I helped Tavia perform a skit at both morning and evening church services to promote Missions Weekend, the big event in the missionary committee calendar. Apparently, it went over quite well. I also registered to go on the Wintercamp early next month. Monday was slow progress at work. I ran into a performance dead-end in my program. I noted that, in a way, I'll be glad when Big Brother is over for the year and I can have six more hours per week for games. Tuesday I did a little bug hunting at work, which was good to break up the monotony. I also started designing a completely new user interface for my program, because the existing one is too slow and cumbersome to be useful. I wouldn't use it if I didn't have to, so I'm sure others will keep away, too. Wednesday I continued tinkering with the new interface, taking the time to get it right. I don't really have that time to spare, so progress is slow. I saw I, Robot for free, thanks to Murrae and Stu, and loved it. It's not entirely true to the stories, but it should at least appeal to today's audiences. Thursday I decided I should write a book. Specifically, a personal management and good-practice textbook for programmers. I think I've learned enough in two years of real-world work to write some of it down. On Friday, we took the youth group kids to see Shrek 2 in the city. Unfortunately for us, various factors combined to make it one of the most expensive things we've ever done with them. They paid only $5 each, and we spent just over $10 per kid. Saturday was a huge night out, by my recent standards. I helped Kym celebrate her birthday at the Sit Down Comedy Club, starting at 7pm. After the show, we stayed around the pub until about midnight, then four of us went to the Elephant and Wheelbarrow to see cover band Blah Blah Blah. I got home at about 2:15am. Mokalus of Borg PS - I seem to be functioning well enough on only a little sleep. PPS - We'll see how well I'm doing later tonight.
My section leader forgetfully left his newspaper behind at my desk a few days ago. I was about to throw it out when I noticed the following headline: Microsoft Wants To Shave Your Dog I haven't read the article, because I prefer to let my imagination run wild, starting with a picture of Bill Gates, a pair of clippers and a maniacal grin. Mokalus of Borg PS - I think I'll pin this particular nugget to my cubicle wall. PPS - It should at least spark some conversations.
I got a chance to see a preview screening of "I, Robot" last night. Of course, since today is the official opening day, it wasn't much of a preview. I enjoyed it more than I anticipated, because my hopes were low after seeing the trailer. It turns out that this movie is not the actionfest portrayed by the trailer - this one's all story. I heard a fellow previewer afterwards complaining that there was "too much story and not enough action". To me, that's absurd, because movies should be about story, and this one is. Mokalus of Borg PS - "You are the dumbest smart person I know". PPS - The producers want you to buy Converse shoes.
Perhaps an award for "Least observant music fan" - I honestly didn't realise that the Black Eyed Peas' song "Let's Get It Started" was just the clean radio edit of "Let's Get Retarded". In my defence, I hadn't heard them both - that would have really been bad. I'd heard the Started version and had heard my friends mention how awful Retarded was, but just didn't make the connection until Channel Ten started using Retarded over their promos for The OC. As for the title of this post, I usually prefer to leave these references half-said. This one is a misquoted song lyric. Mokalus of Borg PS - You could call me a prude or whatever, but I prefer the clean edit. PPS - Maybe I'm just biased towards the one I heard first.
Maybe I'm biased, but I consider human life more valuable than animal life. So, naturally, when I hear some woman on the radio complaining that a baby whale has drowned while trapped in a shark net, I get on edge. When she advocates that we remove the life-saving shark nets so that our marine wildlife will be safe, I stop listening. Mokalus of Borg PS - The relative values of human life to animal life are not negotiable to me. PPS - Just my 2c.
At some point in your life, you will probably need a computer programmer to do something, and you will need to be more specific than you think. Make sure that you say the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. If you make an assumption when telling a programmer what to do, you must, at the very least, tell the programmer that you have made an assumption. Consciously assuming, say, that report columns can be rearranged by the user, is a problem for the programmer, because we can't read minds. We can't read the documents you write to explain your requirements to us - how can we possibly glean extra information from your head? The rule is this: if you think of a requirement that is obvious and need not be stated, write it down anyway. It's going to take you five seconds and save both of us at least a week of development time. Mokalus of Borg PS - Our project is now one year late because of "obvious" unstated requirements. PPS - We hates them.
Last Sunday I missed Ashalea's eviction from Big Brother because I forgot to check how long the double eviction would run. This upset me a bit, because Ashalea was my favourite of the remaining housemates. I also thought that it's not fair for someone (not saying who) to be so great, still single, close by and completely uninterested. On Monday I felt like I achieved very little at work. I should have taken a longer break back when I could, or should have grabbed more sleep. I wanted to spend more time around my friends, just to relax and chat. Tuesday I tried chicken teriyaki sushi for lunch. I got three rolls, though one and a half would have been enough. I struggled through all three and felt quite ill. I got a little break from my regular work routine when I had to hunt down a bug in our graduate application website. Apparently the frame that Hotmail uses to display external links prevented the site security from working, so we had very few applicants proceed past the registration phase. Wednesday I missed the Brisbane auditions on Australian Idol because of a bug in the VCR software I use. I did set it to record for an extra hour, but that only takes effect after another change has been made. I also came to the conclusion that the Professional 2 project at work is possibly too all-encompassing to actually work. Thursday I realised I'd been getting carried away thinking too much about Kym, though it was nice for a while to have someone else on my mind besides ... my previous interest. I got frustrated with my part of Professional 2, also, because I find it difficult to truly reach harmony between the design and the execution. I often find this is true of projects where I am responsible for a user interface. Friday I discussed a security model with Brad and started knocking out some new code to handle it at a low level. I'm not sure it will be entirely capable of carrying that load, though. Also had the first night of youth group, and the kids were definitely a handful. They just could not sit still or be quiet to hear instructions. My entire Saturday morning disappeared before I knew it, what with sleeping in, exercise and television. For most of the afternoon I played urlLink KOTOR and watched movies. We also went to the local Thai restaurant to belatedly celebrate my birthday with just the family. Mokalus of Borg PS - Overall, I felt tired and unmotivated this week. PPS - Now I have more sleeping to do.
Well, it's happened: I've officially stepped over the line from adventure gamer to RPG player. Last night in my KOTOR session I went hunting for experience points purely to level up. Then I kept going because it's extremely cool to see someone fight with a lightsaber, casually deflecting blaster bolts while closing the distance to cut you in half. I've only clocked just over 11 hours of play time and already I know this game is going to be very good to me. Mokalus of Borg PS - I think it will at least hold me off City of Heroes for a while. PPS - Although I will inevitably end up playing that, too.
I dreamed last night that I had to evacuate the office building and I wound up in a concrete fire stairwell with no exit. I was still one floor too high, and I could see that there were other stairs that kept going down, but these ones just ended in a brick wall. I'm sure it means something, in a subconscious way. Mokalus of Borg PS - Today I am tired, run-down and unmotivated. PPS - Those probably all count as synonyms.
I've been debating whether to order a copy of urlLink City of Heroes . Undoubtedly it would be plenty of fun and worth the money - the question is whether I have the time to play it. As I've mentioned before, internet time is currently a scarce commodity in our house, and my suggestion to buy a router was summarily dismissed on the grounds that Final Fantasy XI (and, allegedly, all MMOs) won't run through it. It makes little difference anyway - there's only one box in the house that is equipped both to play the game and connect to the net. Sigh. Mokalus of Borg PS - I could, of course, buy it with the hope that I will one day get a chance to play. PPS - At least the manual would occupy me for a while, but I've already downloaded a copy of that from the CoH website.
It's always dangerous for me to read things like this: urlLink The Code Project - UI UA Changes on the road to Longhorn - .NET . I classify it as danger because I almost get excited about Microsoft products (a definite hacker no-no) and I start developing grandiose software design ideas. These ideas can easily overtake all my current (more important) work, purely in a search for a way to get programmers to write better software. Mokalus of Borg PS - I hope this doesn't mean I'm becoming more of a manager than a programmer. PPS - Because it will still be a few years before I even get near a grey suit.
I celebrated my 25th birthday on the weekend and planned to get together with everyone I know. I intended to accomplish this feat by taking them to a movie and paying for everyone. Apparently, though, some people were confused or wary about the words "free movie", and only eight showed up. In one sense, I'm okay with that, because it cost me less. On the other hand, it annoys me, mostly because I have no explanation from anyone who didn't show up. Mokalus of Borg PS - I suppose, in their defence, I only advertised the event rather late. PPS - And I never followed up on anyone, either.
Hehe, uh, yeah. Forgot to do this on time, but it's still here: The Sunday Mok I got only a few hours sleep on Saturday, and still somehow managed to get through the day. I expected to have trouble staying awake, especially during the sermon at church in the morning. Played more urlLink KOTOR in the afternoon, and got more into it still. After supper at the evening service, it seems everyone had gone home early, so I had to walk back home. Monday, just by chance, I heard about the wrongful urlLink Big Brother eviction at lunchtime, got some details on the web, and saw the re-entry that night. I resolved again to try to get into the next Big Brother house. Tuesday there was more KOTOR on the cards, and I got stuck at the rancor in the sewers. I felt a bit of acid reflux all day, which should have stopped me having lunch, at least. It didn't. I don't want such a big gut, even if it's not grossly prominent. On Wednesday the head of our corporate IT team, Dean, arrived in Brisbane for some reason or other. I was never quite sure what it was all about, though I assume internal politics had something to do with it. We've started having to defend our budget to the board of directors, since our schedule keeps on slipping. Got an invite to Kym's birthday bash, and my urlLink Rookie CD arrived. I was definitely looking forward to seeing Kym more than anyone else who might show up to my own birthday on Saturday. Thursday I felt very near the end of my work on the project, which would be a huge relief to everyone. I also spent some time tweaking our test harness for usability. It still needs work. I looked for a CSS way of doing rounded border corners in web pages and learned that it's a urlLink CSS3 feature - CSS3 is still a working draft and not yet implemented by anyone. Friday night there was no youth group, so I took the chance to check out urlLink Jake 2.0 on TV and play (guess) more KOTOR. Had pizza for lunch and forgot to ask for no anchovies because I had trouble pronouncing the Italian name of the pizza. I also found the Mozilla-specific CSS extension that allows rounded borders. Saturday I took some friends out to see urlLink Spiderman 2 - my shout. In the morning I had my hair cut by Renee at the local barber shop. I went to school with her, though she doesn't remember me. She's cute petit; I've always liked that. At the movie I was so glad to be around Kym that I followed her like a puppy or something. It was weird to see, especially when it seemed like I had no control over my own behaviour. She had to leave before dinner, which we ate at a place called urlLink Noodle Obsessions . Quite good Chinese food, especially the Mongolian beef. Mokalus of Borg PS - I'll try to remember to do this on time in future. PPS - I've just got to make it part of my regular routine.
I've come into the office this morning to find my desk and its various paraphernalia covered in a thin film of dust. Looks like I've been gone for years. I imagine it's quite like Rip van Winkle must have felt. I have yet to properly identify the cause of the dust invasion. My first impression is that somehow the air conditioning vent just nearby has had a large pile of dust gathering inside it, that has just been blown out overnight. That would have looked kind of cool. Mokalus of Borg PS - It also looks like several ceiling tiles have been replaced, which probably knocked down a lot of dust. PPS - It's clogging up our computer case fans, too.
Just one of those moronic things that occur to us at the office: betting on gambling. Some of my colleagues gamble on sports for reasons I won't go into here (m'hay) and apparently one of the "sports" they can place wagers on is poker. Poker being a gambler's game, it seems odd to gamble on it. It only took us a second to come up with something more ridiculous: placing bets on the final bookie's odds on horse racing. Mokalus of Borg PS - I wouldn't want to be the one trying to run it. PPS - But, as has been pointed out, people would still place bets even if they knew it was fixed.
Do accountants celebrate the financial new year? I'm imagining midnight parties, noisemakers, maybe costumes. Mokalus of Borg PS - Since the rest of us don't hear about these parties, it'd be like some secret society. PPS - Probably not.
I made a little time to play Knights of the Old Republic last night and I've just encountered a giant rancor beast that far outclasses my entire party of adventurers. It struck me (an idea, not the rancor) just then that I'm two or three steps removed from my primary goal on this mission. In short, I am trying to sneak past a rancor to get into a gang hideout to steal back an already-stolen swoop bike so I can enter a race in the hope of winning as a prize the person for whom I am searching. There could be an easier way in real life. As for the rancor, it seems only one character I control has the skills to successfully sneak past the beast, at which point I am again outclassed by two shielded gang members in a confined space. The rancor is still behind me, a guarded door in front of me, and I have to stay invisible to stay alive. I'll figure it out eventually, of course. It's just that it always seems confusing and frustrating until I do. Mokalus of Borg PS - Until real life gets more exciting, this is probably the kind of post you can expect. PPS - Except for The Sunday Mok , of course.
Last night, due to a voting mis-count, the latest Big Brother evictee, Bree, was returned to the house. The phone company that handles the phone voting stated "human error" as the cause. I'm sure it's cost them plenty in bad press, time and cold hard cash, but they did act with honesty and integrity. I like Eddie Izzard's comment on admitting wrongdoing - sometimes we do it just so people will think "My, what a strong personality that person has. I like to have sex with people with strong personalities.". I doubt the phone company is similarly motivated, though. I also watched Faking It - the second episode I've ever seen. They turned a shy junkyard worker into a catwalk model. I wondered later if they ever choose a profession that doesn't involve some performance aspect. I wouldn't think so, because it takes a bit of performance to make good television. At the enthusiastic recommendation of a co-worker and the fact that Foxtel is currently giving away the Comedy Channel for free, I watched Conan O'Brian and I don't think I'll bother in future. Having not had the pleasure before, I'd have to say he's a very strange looking guy. His face is just about flat from the front, like he was pressed hard against a wall until his head reshaped. He only made me laugh with "If They Mated". The rest was hardly worth my time. I expected a little more energy. I hardly think the opinion of one Australian will matter, though. Especially since I didn't watch in the first place and don't have the chance to watch later. Mokalus of Borg PS - I left after that, just as Naked News was starting up. PPS - I wonder how long my Dad watched that before changing channels or switching off. Doesn't seem like his kind of show.
I've had a bit more time to play Knights of the Old Republic now, and I'm getting to enjoy it far more than I expected when I started. The Star Wars backdrop is probably helping me get into it, but it's more than just liking Star Wars or puzzle-solving. Before too long I may even go hunting for experience points just to advance levels and skills. Truthfully, I don't make that much time to play. I spend my free time on Big Brother or movies, and at the moment my free time consists of Monday nights, Saturdays and Sunday afternoons. I sleep on Saturday mornings and Sundays, and I've been seeing plenty of movies lately, which I usually do on Saturday afternoon. Monday nights is Big Brother weekly nominations for eviction which takes an hour and a half, and Saturday evenings is often a video night. Any remaining free time in the week is typically needed for sleep. Mokalus of Borg PS - The game says my total playing time so far is just under six hours. PPS - And I'm pretty sure I bought it over a month ago.
I've decided to start summarising my paper journal here every Sunday partly as a way of keeping any of my friends appraised of my current situation, but also for added content. So I give you the first ever edition of: The Sunday Mok Routine church service on Sunday, including Dad's stage fright performance. In the afternoon I attended the farewell service for Richard. At the evening service, I sang and performed in a skit. That's three services, and it made me miss my usual Sunday afternoon sleep. My LED light inside my computer has broken, so now the window on the side of the case just looks in on a few boring circuit boards. It could be a while before I replace it - I've got heaps of other stuff I'm saving for. Monday I watched "Faking it" and Big Brother. I liked Faking It enough to keep watching in coming weeks, and observed some familiar behaviour in BB - a last-ditch romantic effort to get someone's attention that just ends up with humiliation. Tuesday I felt like I got back into the work routine after two days off, but still felt like I was doing less work than I should have been. Made a little progress. Bus ticket prices went down by $4.80 per week for me. Wednesday - still feel like I'm slacking off at work. Decided to start the Sunday posts here. Bought "Fallen" by Evanesence and "Peach Pit Politics" by Rookie. Still waiting for the Rookie CD to arrive by post. Had a youth leadership development meeting tonight with Jane and the rest of the youth group leaders. Noticed how Michelle is getting energised for the church. Thursday I felt like I'd temporarily run out of ideas for my weekday blog posts. Until then I'd had a backlog of ideas that I'd been running through at the rate of one per day. The "rich client" software started to fall to bits. It's a massive tangle of data, events, controls and rules. I don't want to have to keep working on it. I noted my tendency to use any and all change in my pockets to buy food from the vending machine. Friday I managed not to buy anything from the vending machine. I bumped into Lyn, a friend from church who has since moved to another church. Her kids are both getting married, and she seems to be always interested in my love life in a way nobody else is. It's nice to be able to talk about it sometimes. Planned out the coming term of youth group programs along with the SLAM leaders. Ate way too much pizza. Found that Star Wars: Attack of the Clones is playing on Showtime on Monday night, and planned to record it. Saturday I bought Buffy season 2 on DVD and stayed out until 02:00 watching videos and playing Bomberman and Tetris - good retrogaming. Saw Chris for the first time in ages and learned that he's hooked up with a girl he mentioned ages ago. I've been a bit out of touch since he stopped writing to his LiveJournal. Mokalus of Borg PS - I think this will work well. PPS - The format may change a bit as I get more used to this.
Things seem simpler in fiction. Social interaction can come down to just saying the one right phrase at the one right time. We have missions or adventures which, though difficult, are easier to deal with than day-to-day life. There are rarely more than three people involved in a love polygon. If there are more than three, there are lots , and it's played for laughs. Everyone knows how everyone feels, and love blossoms in the blink of an eye. We overcome the odds. Complications iron out. Villains lose, heroes win. There is never a long and arduous cleanup operation after the victory. Mokalus of Borg PS - I am rarely certain which one I prefer. PPS - Probably fiction.
I think I've worked out why this software project is (a) taking so long and (b) sucking the life out of me. We were supposed to be delivering a beta product this week, and we're still taking requirements even as we continue coding. If you believe my university lecturers, any changes we encounter here will cost about 1000 times as much to fix now as they would have if we'd got all the requirements at the beginning. And we always find new changes to make when we go through another round of late requirements. Mokalus of Borg PS - Today my eye started twitching involuntarily. PPS - Not kidding.
Yesterday I read (skimmed) a research paper called urlLink Unskilled and Unaware of It , and it's been playing on my mind ever since. The basic point is this: you need certain skills to recognise those same skills, either in others or yourself. Otherwise, you are likely to consider yourself to be far above your actual level of skill. Ignorance, rather than wisdom, is more often the cause of confidence. I have, naturally enough, been trying to figure out the skills in which I might be deficient, even if I believe I am adequately competent. I have come to the conclusion that I am magnificent in every way, which was a relief. ;) Mokalus of Borg PS - I have known people who have below-average senses of humour. PPS - Those that try to bring the funny are invariably unaware of their lack of skill.
Last night at karate (a non-contact club, mind you) I was punched in the nose. There was a little blood - only a few drops, so it wasn't all that bad. It is the second time I remember bleeding there. I can't remember if the first time was due to a punch or not. Mokalus of Borg PS - I should expect stuff like this to happen. PPS - But, as I mentioned earlier, it's a non-contact club.
I read urlLink this post on SlashDot and thought it might be indicating an article about the coming personal digital device revolution where we all carry around a phone-PDA-iPod-GPS-hard drive. Then I skimmed urlLink the indicated article which seems to be more about a disagreement between RealNetworks and Apple over the rights to interact with iPods. In a hacker's ideal world (and by "hacker" I mean "programmer"), we all use interoperable standards. The iPod wouldn't be the issue at stake, as such, because it would use the one universal managed music format that is freely available to everyone. RealNetworks and Apple would both be providing a service of downloadable music for a fee, and the disagreement would likely be over content theft or the rights to a certain label's music. See the difference? You can do what you like with your content, but the protocol must be open. That's how we create better competition and serve our users properly, because what they want is the music, not the method. Mokalus of Borg PS - I acknowledge that it is often difficult to create a standard that fits everyone's needs. PPS - Most of the time, though, we don't even try.
Just a little observation I've made recently: people who take joy in forms of destruction (explosions, demolitions, smashing things, car crashes) are almost never the people who take joy in forms of creation (design, painting, cooking, writing). It could be that these just represent two kinds of personality, like introverts and extraverts. Some people would blame different interests. I think it goes deeper, down to the core of whether you identify with the light or dark side of The Force, so to speak. If it's fun to smash things and you watch shows like "When Buildings Fall Down", it's possible you're on your way to being the next Darth Vader. Mokalus of Borg PS - I took a break from City of Heroes yesterday. PPS - In practice, that meant playing for only two hours.
Although I was scheduled for a very busy day on Sunday, I came down with a head cold, so I just attended church services. I skipped a lunch event, a charity walk and a karate seminar. This was also the day that I started playing urlLink City of Heroes . On Monday I missed the entire Big Brother final eviction because of a bug in Pinnacle PCTV Pro. I have since found out that the file is corrupted and will still play under certain limited circumstances. My Aunt and Uncle came over for dinner, too, which was unexpected, even though I had apparently been notified in advance. I thought about Saturday night and Kym a bit, too, because she demonstrated a knowledge of and concern for my beliefs that had not been mentioned that night. I almost called in sick on Tuesday, then soldiered on after clearing my head of the mucus that had built up overnight. I did stay home from karate, though. At work I started a significant redesign of the bulk data entry web service, because it was not equipped to handle some new demands. My head cold continued on Wednesday (and is, in fact, still going right now). I missed no work during the week. The Youth Leadership Development training at night made me uneasy about my role, because we were discussing the need to be proficient in areas where I know I definitely lack skills. On Thursday afternoon we had a power outage for an hour. Most of our section went home fairly quickly, but the power did come back on in time to resume work. I stayed. At night, I created my second City of Heroes character - a magical blaster called The Bane Mage. Friday I actually started writing the new web service. I took time to design it properly, which pinpointed the trouble spots and let me informally specify them. I'm doing this one by the book, just to see if it really does keep costs and development time down. The youth group program for the night was based on The Apprentice, which worked rather well. On Saturday I filled most of my day with City of Heroes (I can quit any time I want) and also trekked out to the Garden City Megaplex to see Shaolin Soccer. Shaolin Soccer is, by far, the best kung-fu sports comedy ever. I do think that it could have been written a bit better, though. Mokalus of Borg PS - Then again, without poor writing, how would we know it's a kung-fu movie? PPS - I mean, apart from the kicking, punching, jumping and screaming.

more quizzes... urlLink urlLink urlLink I found these quizzes from urlLink Christina's site. She did the "what color are you" quiz and I didn't want to be just like her :-) so I did the other ones that I thought looked good. What I think is funniest is that in the first quiz it says I'm a tulip, "happy and honest"...but in the third quiz I'm a devil...heh heh heh...I guess that's because I'm a gemini and gemini's have "twin" personalities. Anyway--I hope everyone is having a good Sunday! I tried putting a "survey" up on my page, but the coding kept messing up the rest of the layout, so I'll have to look through the html and find out what I have in there that's bugging up the rest of it!!! Or I guess I could just post the survey in a regular blog post and not bother with the codes and stuff...hmmm...if I was reeeeeeeeeeeeally lazy I could do that!!! YEAH!!! SOUNDS GOOD!!!
what's in YOUR name? My friend urlLink Juls found a cool urlLink site that tells you how your name can relate to what kind of person you are. I did mine and even though I don't agree totally with everything they've said about me...some of it is true...here are my results: Sarah -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your name of Sarah makes you easy-going and refined, but detracts from your physical vitality. You desire all the finer things in life--lovely clothes, home, furniture, and environment. However, procrastination is your worst enemy, and you find yourself lacking the ambition to make your dreams a reality. People are inclined to take advantage of your sympathetic, tractable nature. You naturally attract people with problems who seek your understanding and advice. You can give good advice although it is unlikely that you would follow it yourself. You would be most successful in situations where you can use your skills in diplomacy in handling people, but where you are not under pressure or required to carry responsibility and make decisions. It is difficult for you to be individual and make your own decisions, for you lack self-confidence. Your desire for sweet, rich foods could cause overweight, circulatory problems, or weakness in the kidneys. Yesterday was a bit of fun! We spent the day at urlLink Disneyland . We have annual passes, so like I said in my Friday Five, we don't feel obligated to rush around and do everything humanly possible there in one day. So when we first got there, we ambled around through all the cute little shops on Main Street, USA. We found a bunch of cool Nightmare Before Christmas things and some cute Winnite The Pooh clothes and hats and stuff. It was nice and relaxing. We went on some rides too...some with Hannah together, and a couple we went on by ourselves, one at a time. When I was on Space Mountain by myself, I got thrown up on...it was pretty gross. Space Mountain is a dark roller coaster that's set in...well...space...and it's completely dark and you're flying around and all of a sudden it felt like a bird pooped on me...or maybe it was raining...but then I realized...wait a second...this is an indoor ride...and it was dark so I couldn't tell what hit me and then I figured it out...vomit. HOW GROSS IS THAT? OHHH MAN I almost lost it...when I got off the ride I looked down and it was all over my t-shirt...so I ran into the bathroom and cleaned it up. I walked out to where I was meeting Deane and Hannah and told him I would NEVER go on that ride again! UGH! Totally ruined my day LOL. That's the third time someone has done that to me...my best friend threw up on me one night when she was maybe a little drunk...then at a carnival one year someone above me on a spinning ride threw up on me and my best friend. *sigh* Today we are supposed to go to the beach for a bbq...just the 3 of us. I hope Deane wakes up soon so we can go. We are also supposed to stop by and visit his mom in Woodland Hills and then go to Best Buy to get a disk reader for our digital camera so we can FINALLY download the 400 pictures we have on there. Our digital camera stopped connecting to our computer about 6 months ago...so we have a bunch of pictures on there that we can't send people or print out ... word to the wise...don't waste your money on the urlLink Polaroid MP3 Digital Camera ...not worth it... although it may look cool...ugh.
new look... Thanks urlLink Jennie for the info on changing the backgrounds!!! What does everyone think? Huh? I like it!
friday five I don't have much to post about today. Today was just another average day and I don't want to be toooo repetitive in my blog...so I decided to try out the urlLink Friday Five again. 1. What are your favorite ways to relax and unwind? I like reading books, going for walks, being by myself, watching a good tv show...or listening to music. 2. What do you do the moment you get home from work/school/errands? When I get home from work, I normally either make something to eat or change out of my clothes. Then I play with Hannah, eat dinner and relax. 3. What are your favorite aromatherapeutic smells? Hmmm...I like lots of smells...I think my favorite smells though are vanilla, watermelon, lemon and raspberry... 4. Do you feel more relaxed with a group of friends or hanging out by yourself? It depends on if it's my friends, or if they're people I dont' know too well. When I'm with my friends, I am very relaxed, I can be "me" around them and they don't judge me and I don't "feel" like they're judging me. When I'm around Deane's friends, who I don't know that well still, I feel a bit un-relaxed...they are all very nice, but I still don't know them too well, and when I'm around some of them, I feel the age difference between us, and I feel the fact that I have nothing in common with them, I didn't go to school with them, I don't know them at all really...and that makes me a bit uncomfortable. 5. What is something that you feel is relaxing but most people don't? Hmmmm...I don't know. I know of things that other people do to relax that I don't find relaxing...like smoking and drinking, and partying...a lot of people I know think of a relaxing weekend as going out and getting drunk or stoned and going crazy with parties ... and I don't find that relaxing at all...fun maybe (minus the smoking and stoned part!)...but definetly not relaxing. I guess maybe I like going to Disneyland, I think that's relaxing and a lot of people don't. But then again, I have an annual pass and never feel "obligated" to rush around and take in all the rides. I can enjoy the littler things at the park, and sit under a tree or something with Deane and Hannah if we want. Other people think I'm crazy when I say that we spent the day relaxing at Disneyland *smile*
september 26th 2002 Today was soooo exhausting. After a horrible day at work, we had to run errands. We went to Target and I ALWAYS hate going in there. Sure it's cheap, but for some reason, I always feel claustrophobic in places like Wal Mart, K Mart and Target. After that we went to Costco, which is always fun. We wandered through there, STARVING our heads off, getting ready to eat Hannah for lack of nothing better to eat...it was terrible. We finally settled on pizza...for the second night in a row *half gag* but hey...when you're hungry and too lazy to cook, pizza looks realy good. I watched a bunch of good season premieres tonight. Friends, CSI, ER, and Without A Trace were all excellent!!! I wasn't toooo impressed with CSI:Miami, but then again, it was a stiff series premiere...so I'll give it another chance. I still love the first one though...in Las Vegas. What a sad life I have...only being interesting enough to talk about television shows... I need such a life!
bed tiiiime! OK So I should be in bed...because I have a HOOOORRIBLE habit of over-sleeping...pushing my alarm clocks snoooooooze button to it's very last snoooooooze of the day...tonight I watched a pretty funny show. It's rare that a new tv show debuts these days without sucking...but urlLink Life With Bonnie definetely made me laugh...Bonnie Hunt is one of my favorite actresses and this show is reaaaaally fun to watch! I shall stay tuned *smile* Other than that...not much :-) Deane made yummmmmmy chicken fajitas tonight...we eat a lot of fajitas and tacos around here. Tis' ok...he also made au gratin potatoes (When I was a kid I didn't care for them at all and would call them "rotten potatoes" ... my mom appreciated that quite a bit ... but now I like them ... so no more complaining) She probably would serve them with something I didn't like though...like fish...or liver...but I don't know...I'm just making stuff up as I go here. I feel like I should be doing something...I'm very energetic tonight for some reason...I'm in one of those moods where I feel so energetic like I could run the Boston Marathon...twice...and still have room left over for Bloomsday (My fellow Eastern Washingtonians know what Bloomsday is) However, I'm sure if those chances ever arose, I'd get to the starting line and plop down on the white line with a soda and a bag of chips to watch the *real* athletes do it!!! I really wish I had the energy to re-do the stinkin' layout on my blog...I dont' like the dark colors anymore!!! But then I'd have to re-write all my links because I'm too lazy to just change the background on the template I already have. Gosh I'm so lazy. I need to stop complaining. I'm one of "those" people tonight. "Mrs. Negative" "Mrs. Cynical" "Mrs. Nasty Attitude" *blah*!!!!!!!!!!!
watch out for the ducks! Three women die together in an accident and go to Heaven. When they get there, St.Peter says,"We have only one rule here in Heaven...don't step on any ducks." So, they enter Heaven and sure enough, there are ducks all over the place. It is almost impossible not to step on any ducks. Although they try their best to avoid them, the first woman accidentally steps on a duck. Along comes St.Peter with the ugliest man she ever saw. St.Peter chains them together and says,"Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend all eternity chained to this man!" The next day, the second woman accidentally steps on a duck, and along comes St.Peter with another extremely ugly man. He chains them together with the same punishment as the first woman! The third woman has observed all this and, not wanting to be chained for all eternity to an ugly man, is VERY VERY careful where she steps. She manages to go months without stepping on any ducks. One day St.Peter comes up to her with the most handsome man she has ever laid eyes on....very tall, muscular, tan and with great hair. St.Peter chains them together without saying a word and walks away. The woman looks at the man and remarks,"I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to you for all eternity!!!" And the guy says,"Well, I don't know what you did, but I stepped on a duck!"
not a whole lot goin' on! *sigh* I don't really have much to post!!! Today was an average day. Woke up late (as usual), went to work, worked, came home, and vegged out...*sigh* That's my life in a nutshell. So I'm not going to bore the readers with anymore senseless ramblings.
"does someone have a case of the mondays???" heh heh heh...gotta love that movie! Today I worked alone for the most part. My colleague that normally works with me had the day off for her birthday. It went by soooooo much faster than I thought it would...I figured if I was alone that I wouldn't have anyone to talk to and I'd be bored...but it was just the opposite...I had lots to do and lots of people to talk to. I've been following this urlLink story about the mom who beat her 4 year old in a department store in Illinois...totally makes me sick to my stomach to imagine anyone hurting a little kid like that. What could that kid have possibly done to deserve it? The lawyer claims the child was running around the store taking toys out of boxes and making a scene...so what? Put her in a stroller...or a shopping cart...don't beat the holy crap out of her!!! Hannah can be a MOOOOOOONSTER sometimes...and there are times where I tell her "You are driving mommy NUTS!" But I would NEVER EVER EVER do any sort of bodily harm to her! She's just way to sweet and way too innocent to want to harm!!! UNTIL SHE STARTS CLIMBING ON THE FILING BOX FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME!!! UGH she just fell off of it and rolled across the floor... got up and started laughing about it. *shaking my head in disbelief* *sigh* Will try to post more later...I just found out my mom reads this and doesn't say hi on my tagboard or the comments section so I didn't know she was here *GASP* Guess I better stop with the dirty talk...LOL Just kidding...
friend update We found our missing friend. The one that was supposed to move in with me on 9/8/02 but never showed up, never called...I was sooo upset that she would leave us out to dry like that and worried at the same time...our friend Myra finally tracked her down...she IS back in Washington living at home ... her mom says she's just really distraught and feeling like a failure and has been too embarrassed to contact us...HELLO...she was supposed to move in with me...a little understanding would go along way sometimes! Yes, I understand she's in a bad place right now...and embarrased and feeling like a failure...but you don't tell someone you're moving in with them, have them completely rearrange their life and their house for you to just not show up or call or have someone ELSE call for you. I would've understood if she had called two days before, the day before or even the DAY she was supposed to move in and say "You know what, I think it's best that I just move home...I'm sorry it didn't work out, but thanks for the offer..." but nooooooooooo...not a WORD!!! I wouldn't have been mad at her...I would've understood and I would've been able to help her through her problems...or atleast be there for her as a best friend... I'm just glad she's ok. I was worried...half of me knew she was in Washington and the other half of me thought her useless pile of ex boyfriend had done something to her. I hope she calls me. I want to be there for her while she gets better...but I think she also needs to know what I've gone through since 9/8/02 when she disappeared off the face of the earth...I won't yell or lose my temper...but I think I have a right to explain to her why she can't just do that to someone...right? Am I right? Am I wrong? Any advice would be great. Thanks.
another lazy day OK So I don't think we'll be doing anything today...at all...and to me, that sucks. I realize that we need time to relax...but I thought that's what we did yesterday? *sigh* Lastnight was fun though. We went to a friends house for dinner. They have 3 boys, one is only about a year older than Hannah and they were playing in the living room and all of a sudden he smacks her with the remote! She was ok of course...nothing serioius...but she was tired and I think even a bit shy around them since she didn't know them...and of course not expecting it...so she freeeeeeeeaked out *frown* It was sad, but nothing serious...everyone has asked me "Well...aren't you mad at the little boy for hitting her?" Umm...no...first of all, he's not even two yet...and second...he's got two big brothers that beat up on eachother all the time! It's the nature of little boys to play rough and he is probably used to seeing his brothers laugh at stuff like that and wanted to make Hannah laugh *smile* and it's not like he broke anything...she's fine...so I'm not mad and it won't stop me from letting her play with him again! Anyway--it's noon...and Deane and Hannah are both napping. SO I'm bored...as usual. Wishing I had something to do. But I don't. So here I sit. Bored bored bored. I was going to try and figure out how to put blinkies on my page since I saved a bunch from Jennie's urlLink Page yesterday and from some other sites as well...I just dont' feel like doing it though. I did open an account with urlLink Lycos yesterday so that I could use an FTP account for my blog...I even uploaded the images....I just need to post them in here now *smile* That should take me another two months...laaaaaaazy!!! I showed someone my webpage lastnight at dinner because she wanted to see baby pictures of Hannah...and when I loaded the page I realized that I hadn't updated my page since July! I felt like such a loser! It didn't matter to her because the pictures were still great, but I felt bad for neglecting my page that I've worked my rear-end off on for the last five years...*sigh* YES I've had a page that long...NO it hasn't always been with geocities...but I've had one for as long I can remember. *sigh* Time to go shower and make the best of yet another boring day.
HAPPY WEEKEND!!! I was going to upload some pictures this morning, since a urlLink friend of mine told me where to go to upload them so I can use them in my blog *smile* (Thanks Juls!) Anyway, time, as usual, got away from me and I didn't have time to do it, and now I have to get ready to go to a friends house for dinner...*sigh* It's ok though, I'm kind of growing tired of upkeeping my webpage with cute graphics and flashy stuff...so maybe I'll just keep this low key...although I did find some reeeeeeeeeally cute blinkies on Jennie's site and at another blinkie depot place...but we'll see. Yesterday's Friday Five sort of disappointed me...previous ones have been really good, but this set was sort of dull...we'll see how they do next week and that will decide whether I keep doing it anymore. This morning I was up at 4:30 a.m...and at 7 a.m. decided that since I was awake and not doing anything, and Hannah was finally sleeping, I would go to the DMV and get my CAL State ID card...so I did. Everyone at work that knew I was going today was like "OOOOH You'll have to wait in line for HOURS! Everyone goes on Saturday!" I was in and out of there in like an hour...the whole trip took less than two hours and I had to take the bus. While I was there I grabbed the CAL State drivers handbook as well...I figure I should learn to drive someday soon, since I'm almost 23 and all...LOL... Tonight we're having dinner with one of Deane's co-workers and his family. I don't know for sure where they live, but I'm looking forward to seeing them! They have a little boy that's almost 2...so him and Hannah should get along...She's still fighting off a cold though so I don't know how sociable she'll be tonight...especially with boys *smile* OOOH I just checked out Christina's urlLink Recipe page...(sorry that it took me so long LOL) she has some good ones on there that I think sound good!!! OH MAN...Hannah picked up "Spinning" at daycare...she stands in the middle of the floor (Or dangerously close to a table) and spins herself around until she topples over. It's hilarious...Deane also taught her to shake her head from side to side really fast...so she does that a lot too...it's so fun to watch her mind grow everyday! She learns all kinds of new things and it's fun watching her experiment!!! Anyway, I have to get her dressed and all prettified for her night out *smile*
the friday five 1. Would you say that you're good at keeping in touch with people? So so...I keep in touch with the people that are most important to me...close friends and family. For the other people in my life, I keep in touch with them when I can...when I have a free minute or something. They all understand my priorities though and none of them get toooo cranky when I don't write them. Besides, by now they all know I have a blog and can read up on me here. 2. Which communication method do you usually prefer/use: e-mail, telephone, snail mail, blog comments, or meeting in person? Why? Hmmmmmm...I would have to say e-mail or blog comments...why? Because that way I'm in control of the conversation. If I run out of things to say in an email or a blog, I can just end it and send it...if I'm on the phone or in person, I have to sit there and wait for the other person to finish and get bored before I can get out of the conversation. As for snail mail...I like doing that too, but only if I can type out my letter...I haven't hand written a whole lot since HS, so my hands cramp up a lot if I have to write too much...I prefer typing. 3. Do you have an instant messenger program? How many? Why/why not? How often do you use it? OHHHH YES, I have just about every kind. I have AOL IM, YAHOO Messenger, MSN Messenger and ICQ...plus my tagboard on my blog and the comment system. I don't know if the last two count, but I think they would qualify. I have so many different chat programs because I like to keep in touch with family and friends. My newest chat program is YAHOO, I got that because my family sent me a webcam and they used YAHOO for their webcams and so I installed it as well so we can chat like that. Deane got me hooked on AOL IM...and as for ICQ...I never use it, but I have it and it's a special program for me, seeing as how I met Deane through ICQ...I'm not sure why we have MSN...probably because we both have Hotmail accounts or something...but I can't remember why we installed it. 4. Do most of your close friends live nearby or far away? Most of them live far away...although Deane is one of my best friends :-) I'm not originally from Southern California, so my friends are mostly back in my home state of Washington...I miss them *frown* Although I am making some new friends at my new job, I doubt any of them will ever take the place of my dear friends back home. 5. Are you an "out of sight, out of mind" person, or do you believe that "distance makes the heart grow fonder"? I believe in "distance makes the heart grow fonder" ... I'm a true believer in "You won't miss it til it's gone"...I think I took my friends and family for granted ... until I moved away from their support and love...and now that I'm away from them, I miss them more than I ever did when I lived there...plus I really think about them a lot and appreciate the times that we did have together...no matter what was going on...atleast I had friends I could count on and the support of a great family.
it's ALIIIIIIVE!!! Yay! I'm so glad my blog loaded tonight!!! Today was an interesting day...for the last hour and a half of my day, I work all by myself and one of few people left in our building...which is normally great because with no distractions, I fly through my work and get a lot done...but today right at 4, when the other lady leaves for the day, I finished with my last project and had nothing to do but twiddle my thumbs until 5:30! It sort of was boring, until one of my coworkers came out to decorate the other half of my desk for Moe's birthday tomorrow. I don't know what sort of importance that is, but it was entertaining :-) I got an email from a girl I used to live next door to. It made me feel old to read that she'd be moving into her college dorm tomorrow...I used to babysit this girl...ugh. THEN I found out her little sister is in HIGH SCHOOL...*sigh* I never thought they'd grow up...and they have. I feel 80. Plus I started feeling bad for not keeping up with what's happening in my hometown. I'm sure nothing interesting is going on, seeing as how it was a hole in hell when I lived there, and I didn't see it improving on the few visits I made there after I left. I think about it a lot though, I think about High School a lot...I don't know why, it's not like I would ever want to go back, or that I ever think "gosh, I had it so much better in high school..." because I didn't. I'm much happier where I'm at today...I guess maybe I'm just curious what all my old class mates are doing...maybe. I know that most of the girls I went to school with and HATED are probably all still fast, cheap and easy...*smirk* Gosh I didn't like those girls at all...lol. I had two real *enemies* in HS...they never actually did anything to me, and if I was a nicer person, I'd probably forgive and forget, but I just really didn't like them and still get really upset when I think about them...one of them swore me to secrecy when I found out she lived on a farm *GASP* NOOOO NOT A FARM! HELLLLO You freakin' MORON...you're from KETTLE FALLS...in FARM COUNTRY! Half the people at our school were either farmers or cowboys...give it up. SEE I still get upset :-) Anyway--Hannah is wiggling around in my lap and trying to eat the monitor so I'm gonna go. SHE WONT STOP GRABBING THINGS! AAAAAAAH PUT DOWN THE DISKS!!!

MY BLASTED BLOG ISN'T LOADING!!!
a bit homesick I don't know what will happen, if for some reason my bosses don't approve my time off for Thanksgiving this year. I reeeeeally want to go home and see my family for the long weekend. I was really missing them tonight. I was looking at Hannah and remembering what my neice, Heilee (pronounced Hayley), was like when she was a year old. She is so fun and so pretty, but I can't believe she's 10 1/2 now...when she was here in July we were swimming in the pool and I tried to lift her up to throw her over my shoulder and completely forgot that she's not a 30 lb. 6 year old anymore...not that she's huge or anything...she just weighs as much as a normal 10 year old...not a 6 year old...I still see her as the little girl she was when she first came to live with us. I miss her very much!!! Then there's my dad...I miss him sooo much too. I atleast got to see my mom and Heilee in July...I haven't seen dad since February...he's so very sweet and I miss him so so so much. I wish there was a way to have the life I have right now, and have my parents and Heilee close by. As for my mom, well...who doesn't miss their mom? I miss her very much and I really miss it when I was unemployed and she would call me on her lunch break and we'd talk while she ate lunch or went for a walk. As for my brother, I haven't talked to him much in the last 4 or 5 years, so I don't really know what he's up to. I miss him too though...I know that he's happy and has a good life...but I just wish we could talk more. Between him and my sister, I always felt closer to him than to her...probably because he didn't let me down as much (ALTHOUGH HE STILL OWES ME A CHOCOLATE MILK FROM KINDERGARTEN!!! LOL) I'm looking forward to Thanksgiving. I probably won't get to see my brother...he doesn't travel much for the holidays for reasons unknown to me...but that's ok...I guess I'm just not meant to spend time with him anymore. Deane is on the phone with his friend Betsy (I think that's who called)...so I'm in here diddling around on my silly blog... urlLink Buffy is on...I thought she was supposed to have died? I've never seen more than 2 minutes of this show the entire time it's been on and it's sort of just on in the background because the show I was watching before this is over...but anyway...I thought she died? What happened? Is this like a Soap Opera where anything can happen? *sigh* I'm sure my friend Myra's head is spinning right now because Sarah Michelle Gellar finally married Freddie...Myra sort of had a thing for him and when I broke the news to her that they were engaged, she called me all sorts of names and damned me to Hell...LOL....so I'm very sorry Myra that he's married...if you makes you feel better, I found out that she got Montezuma's Revenge at the wedding in Mexico...heh heh heh... OK, I'm out of here for now gang! Take care!
more movie watching... Hannah is trying to sweep our floor with the biggest broom in the world...or atleast to her it's the biggest broom in the world...She keeps bonking herself in the head with it. She has this box of "Gerber Graduate" Animal Crackers and she loves loves loves them...well I guess I didn't give her enough earlier, because somehow she got the box off the coffee table and when I walked out there she had crackers all over the floor and crumbs dripping off her chin...she was holding the empty box shaking it and looking at me like "See Mommy! I wanted more!!!" UGH! hehehehehe...it was cute. I've been cleaning the messy apartment all afternoon. I got our bedroom done and am working the living room and doing laundry (sorry Deane, but I'm even washing your clothes even though you don't like me to...there's just SOOO many though!) Right now I'm watching urlLink Someone Like You with Ashleigh Judd, Hugh Jackman and Greg Kinnear. I don't know if Deane likes this movie, but I really do. I've seen it a hundred times...but there's never anything good on in the afternoon. Time to finish cleaning.
oooooooh comments! YAY! I figured out the comments section of my blog!!! Woopee!!! OK time to go straighten up the apartment.
movies... I'm having a lazy-day. *sigh* I was all gung-ho about going out with Hannah and getting my shiny new Cal. State Id card, and realized...waaaait! I don't have a stroller! The two strollers we do have are in the trunk of our car...which is in Glendale with Deane today *sigh*. So then I called Deane's brother and they offered to let me use one of their strollers...so I said OK! Good idea. Then I changed my mind like an hour later and decided to just let Hannah stay home and rest today and hopefully *fingers crossed* feel better. So I watched urlLink American Pie 2 ... yes Deane...I WATCHED IT AGAIN TODAY... heh heh heh...Now we're going to watch urlLink Regarding Henry . I've always only seen from the middle of this movie to the end...I've never seen the beginning. Besides, he has a cute puppy named Buddy!!! Speaking of puppies (and beagles...which Buddy is)...I found the neateest website today. urlLink Beagles On The Web is all about being a foster-owner to a beagle! We've decided that when we get a dog, it'll be a beagle! I would like to adopt a puppy...if we were ever to get all the different kinds of dogs that we want though, we'd be "those" people...the kind of people you see on TV that have a million dogs on this big muddy farm where we go "glushing" around in mud feeding them every morning. Nevermind...that doesn't make any sense. I just want a puppy...
quiz madness!!! I'm Kermie!!! YAY!!!
hannah's sickie poo *frown* Good morning! Here's an interesting quiz...and a bizarre look into my life... urlLink I feel so bad for the little monkey! She's snifflie and conjested and unless I wipe her nose and use that little nose suckler thing to suck the gross stuff out constantly, she has a hard time breathing out her nose. I can't use the nose suckler thing all the time though, it's like convincing an elephant that he needs to wear tennis shoes! The amazing thing is that this cold isn't slowing her down one bit! She's not fazed by it one bit...she's ripping apart my catalog even as we speak! It's so funny. I'm glad it's not making her too grumpy...the teething already takes care of that for us! Oh my God...she's climbing on our file box. OK whew...she's crazy I tell ya. This is the first day I've missed from work since I started. I was a bit nervous calling in, but luckily my bosses are both female and most of the people I work with are as well...so they're a bit more compassionate about sick babies then men would be...atleast I think so anyway. Deane was home with her yesterday though, and he's been so good about staying home with her since I started work, but he's missed a few days and we don't want him in trouble do we? So I stayed with her today and everyone at work seems to be nice about it...*sigh of relief* I'm always afraid that when I call in sick someone will call me back and say "Sorry...tough luck...you're FIRED! " lol. I'm such a paranoid freak aren't I???
I am sweet, like Sugar . I am all sweetness and light; fluffy bunnies and dancing fairies; happiness and joy. Too much of me will make you sick. What Flavour Are You?
mmm....sleeeep... Wow, ok...so we just all took a 3 1/2 hour nap! It felt sooooooo gooood to sleep!!! Hannah woke up grumpy and upset though, she needed a new diaper and a fresh bottle and she went right back to sleep. I think she's getting her two upper teeth and on top of that she still has the snifflies!!! So hopefully in a few weeks she'll have two shiny new teeth to bite us with!!! We haven't eaten dinner, and I'm ok with that for some reason...it seems like whenever I'm tired, or have taken a long nap, I don't eat when I wake up, and then it's so late that it's practically time to go back to bed, so then I don't eat at all, and wake up in the morning starving...and since I only eat lunch and dinner, I suffer until 1p.m. when I finally get lunch! It's such a twisted world I live in :-) On our last trip to Costco, I discovered they don't sell cases of orange soda...weird eh? They do sell "party packs" of soda that have a variety of different sodas, like cherry soda, root beer, orange soda and lime soda...so we got that...now, I've never been a huge root beer fan...but that's what I've been drinking the most of lately...weird huh? It's like a new taste to me almost and it's sooo addicting. *shaking my head* Anyway--time to roll!
married...but lonely...email I got OK if you're married and having problems...I understand you need someone to talk to, as I know several people in real life as well as a couple online that are having marital problems...however, the following email arrived in my inbox today and while I normally just delete the spam mails I get, this one struck me as funny and sad all at the same time... marriedbutalwayslonely has arrived! How have you been? You would not believe what I found but it is true. There is a site for people to talk, chat, see each others pictures, and even meet each other as close as next door that I found.But that's not the best part, here is why it's so unbelievable, not all the people are single, in fact, a lot of them are even married, looking to satisfy their hungriest desires. marriedbutalwayslonely has arrived! You would not believe what is going on and what people are saying about this site, check this out! I'm sure I'm not the only that's gotten this email...as it's a spam email and probably reaches thousands of people everyday. I'm just wondering what kind of people would actually do something like this. I mean...I've never been able to understand why anyone would want to be in more than one relationship at a time...why not, if you're unhappy enough to start "wandering" not just get out of the unhappy one, whether you're married or not...and move on to someone that makes you happy? Maybe because I've never really experienced anything like that for myself...where I've been in an unhappy relationship and thought about cheating...or maybe it's because I just can't picture anyone ever actually going through the cheating process...it doesn't seem worth it to me in the end, because it always ends badly and always more than one person, more than likely yourself included, gets hurt. *sigh* I feel sorry for the people that are like this...that look at life and decide that infidelity and lying is a safe healthy route. Kudos, however, go out to those that have learned their lessons and have picked a better road to go down...as I know some guys that have made a full turn around and realized they were total idiots to do something that crazy. Am I making any sense? Does anyone agree? Disagree? I have extremely strong feelings about infidelity...and lying especially. I'm a strong believer in this: "If you tell me the truth right now, I can't guarantee that I wont' be upset...but atleast I won't be as upset with you as I would be if you lied to me about it and I found out the truth later." Does that sound right? I think so. I mean, we can't guarantee that we won't be mad, or hurt...but isn't it always better to be honest? I'm sure that email got wasn't implying that we should "cheat" on our spouses and loved ones...but it sure wasn't sending us the "don't cheat" message either...was it? As with all spam I get, I did delete it, but I thought I would post it here to help make some sort of point about how I feel about this subject. Hannah is throwing a royal fit though so I'm gonna go help calm her down!!!
EARLY DAY YIPPEEEEEE!!! urlLink what's your battle cry? | urlLink mewing.net | urlLink merchandise! I found that quiz in urlLink Christina's Blog. I thought it was hilarious that her battle cry was "moo" and mine was "meep" What animal "meeps"??? I guess maybe the road runner huh? Gosh that's even funnier, I am not a road runner...hehehehe...I dont' run anywhere. It wouldn't be hard for the Coyote to catch me...I'm so old and slow now that a turtle could catch me. Today was a good day. Hannah had the snifflie's so her and Deane had a quality father/daughter/winnie the pooh day together. And they picked me up for lunch so we went to urlLink Quizno's and then wandered around urlLink Bed Bath and Beyond until I had to go back to work. Today was my early shift day. I worked 7:00-4:00. It was a nice change, getting off work early and having more time with Deane and the baby. I hated waking up at 4:45 a.m. though...I forgot that time even existed...good lord it was so dark outside! UGH! Plus I missed my bus, so I had to run down my street about a half mile to try and cut it off when it turned to head East toward my urlLink job . When I got there, I was the ONLY ONE THERE, so I had to walk around back through the big scary ware house in the almost dark. I walked through there like a sniper would...to make it that much scarier (for someone already scared of the dark), a computer was beeping and I thought it was a man eating robot LOL...ok that was a bit of an over-excited imagination...but still...it was scary! I don't know if I already said this or not, but two weeks ago I opened a new bank account and they took my picture for my check card...well, Deane upgraded his check card on the same day to a photo ID. And I guess because we have the same address and our pictures were taken together, they mixed up our pictures, so when I got my card, it had my name on it and my signature, but his picture...it was soooo funny. So we had to go in and get our pictures taken again. Deane is convinced I'm trying to turn him into a woman, since I'm always making him hold my purse for me, and the baby, and push the stroller...and now he thinks I had them put his picture on my card on purpose *smile* too cute. Anyway, my hand is cramping up, so I'll finish for now. I'm sure to have more later though, as this blog is the only way I'm really communicating with anyone right now!
SOOOO MUCH FOOOOOOD... ugh...stop the insanity!!! I hardly ate any dinner lastnight *but atleast now we know why Carl's Jr. calls it the "Super Value Combo" ... it's perfect for someone with no cash and a teeeeny tiiiiiiny almost non-existent stomach! Yikes! But today...man oh man...it seems like all I've done is eat eat eat. Which isn't healthy for anyone, but when you think about what I've eaten, it's a heart attack waiting to happen!!! Have you ever thought about stuff like what would the world be like if dogs were called cats and cats were called dogs? What if black was white and red was blue? Would we really be that much different? I dont' think so. I think about this a lot...I'm a bit strange actually. Does anyone like sports? I LOOVE baseball...I work with a bunch of hockey fanatics (sorry fellow coworkers...in case they read this) but I do not like Hockey...I do not like it at all...I like it as much as Sam I Am likes Green Eggs and Ham...he does not! But all day I listen to them talk about it and how their very goal in life (or atleast this hockey season) is to turn me into a Rangers fan "RANGERS BABY...YEAH!!!" lol...yeah, right. Yesterday I watched my first soccer game...live. Deane's neice plays soccer, so we went over to the field to watch her game. She's 9 and this is like her fourth or fifth year in soccer...if only I was that athletic when I was her age, maybe I wouldn't be twins with a blimp hangar right now. Her team lost, but not because she didn't try! It was fun watching them all competitive and stuff. There was a pair of twins on her team that I would be afraid to play against!!! I hope we get to watch her play again, it was so much fun! I'm having second thoughts about my schedule tomorrow. I really don't want to go into work an hour and a half early...the positive side of that is I get off an hour and a half early...but I have to get up sooooo early...ugh. I'm such a whiner sometimes huh? I told you...mindless ramblings...
better day Today was better. Thank God. We lounged around the apartment all day and had a good talk this morning. Hannah actually wasn't too much of a terror...she had a few teething episodes that almost sent me through the roof, but nothing to bad :-) Tomorrow I go into work an hour and a half early! Yikes...I hope I can wake up in time. I'm watching urlLink "Indian Summer" for the second time today! Deane is making enchiladas for dinner and Hannah is napping. I tried to wake her up but she was pretty non-responsive!!! I dont' really have a lot to say right now...it's sort of been a s l o w news days here at our household!!! I just wanted to write something down. I wish we had been able to go do something, but I think this was actually better for us, to just stay home and relax and spend time together. I feel closer to him now than I have in a week...so I feel better. We just need to find a way to spend more time together. Some coworkers have offered their babysitting services to us if we ever need one, so hopefully we'll be able to take advantage of that when we need to get away alone once in awhile. I miss him.
just another entry! OK So I may or not be done posting. I'm going to *TRY* and go to sleep now...if my conscience will allow such an absurd idea. This blog deal is getting more and more depressing as time goes on (and I've only had the crazy thing for what...an hour?) *sigh* Tonight I watched two TV Show reunions...both shows are shows I watched growing up, so it's not like I watched their reunions for nothing. The first one was the urlLink Growing Pains Reunion ...I mean come on...who didn't watch that show as a kid? And the other one was the urlLink Facts of Life Reunion ...I LOOOOVED that show when I was little...probably only because Natalies RL name is Mindy...and that is my sister's name as well...I thought they were the only two on the planet named Mindy! They were both cute movies though and it made me feel 7 years old again...and that helped me relax a bit and not be so uptight about stuff that's going on. I'm sure Deane was thinking "Why is she watching this stuff?" But oh well...kids will be kids.
second entry OK SO I think I MAY have figured this stupid blog crap out. It took me foooooorever though and my brain is definetly releasing a huge sigh of relief now. *whew* I still don't know quite all the ins and outs of this, but I'm sure with a few more brain farts, I'll generate something cool out of it. It's now 2:00 a.m. (Like anyone actually cares)...and I'm still not feeling human and I'm still not feeling better. Hopefully this blog gets more cheerful...or else I'll just depress myself right into hermitdom...*sigh* OK I'm gonna see if I can get this darn friggin thing to work.
first entry Alright, so tonight is my first entry. It's 1:30 a.m. and I'm wide awake. Don't know why. Just full of frustration. Frustration with what you ask? Life. Work. Love. Friends. Money. I'm happy with life, but if only I were a wizard that could change little odd ball frustrations with the drop of my wand or something. For example, if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have let myself get so excited about my friend moving in with us. Because she never showed up. And I'm stuck worrying about her...and being mad at her all at the same time. Another example...I would work up the courage to ask Deane what's bothering "us" lately. We just seem so far apart this last week that I don't feel like we're even on the same page right now. I haven't felt like this in years, and it used to be like this because he was hiding secrets from me...which I don't know if that's still true...I hope it's not...but if it is, I'd like to know. But if I ask him about it, he'll get upset and accuse me of not trusting him...which I do trust him...I just need to know what's been between us. *sigh* What a crappy depressing way to start a blog. UGH.
soooooooo much suuuuuuuuuuugar UGH NO MORE CANDY PUHLEEEASE!!! I've been eating candy since 8 a.m. If I don't stop now I'll turn into a mound of sugar and melt away into ... some... gross...sugar river or something. I gave the last of my candy to Deane when I got home tonight and he said "Oh, that reminds me...here" and hands me a handful of twizzlers...my favorite *frown* SO I HAD TO EAT THEM! *groan* On an EVEN sadder note...if that's possible...we can't take Hannah out tonight *frown frown* She's got some sort of rash all over the front of her body and around her neck. Her back is ok...but it looks like she fell headfirst into something that she's allergic to...so we aren't going to go out after all. *frown* Hannah is in the bath being a grumpus. Oh well! We've only had a few trick or treaters tonight...a scary demon kid and a skeleton...we have a TOOON of candy though so I handed each of them like 5 pieces and they both looked at me with huge eyes like "WOOOOOW, sooo much candy!!!" hehehehehe it was great. I have a friend at work who said today that she's lived in her house for twenty-five years and adults that went to her house as kids, are now bringing their kids to her house because she gives out really good treats every year and they remember her. I want that. I really do. I want to live somewhere where I'm that appreciated. Anyway--I'm off to figure out what's wrong with Hannah.
two weather pixies? That's not right! For some reason when I came to my blog tonight, two weather pixies were showing up! Weird eh? I checked my html and it was only showing one...hmmm *scratching head in confusion* Anyway-- I noticed that I haven't been posting as much here! Probably has a lot to do with the boring life I tend to lead. Plus, the last couple of nights, Deane has been on here a lot (A lot more than he thinks...) so that's sort of taken away from time I would spend in here just wanting to check my email. Lastnight I came in to check my mail and was in here about 5 minutes and went to help him tuck Hannah in and by the time I came back in here...about 10 minutes later...he was already online...so I just ignored it and went out to watch TV. Tonight I saw urlLink Poltergeist for the first time...I've also seen urlLink The Shining recently for the first time...two movies that I've always heard about how scaaaaaaaaary they are...I'm sorry...did I miss something? Not really all that scary...just extremely creepy...along with urlLink The Exorcist . None of them were "scary-frightening"...just creeped me out totally. On a less sickening note...my fingers have really been swollen today! I haven't been able to wear my engagement ring and my watch is tighter than usual! Usually, if I'm bloated or something, my ankles will swell up too, but not today...just my hands and wrists...kind of strange. They haven't been this swollen since I was pregnant...and NO I am not...thanks for asking though.
sleepy!!! Lastnight I stayed up way too late watching Third Watch...Deane even went to bed before me, which NEEEEVER happens!!! I'm usually in bed asleep before 10...but lastnight I was up until 11:30. So needless to say that this morning at work I was fairly worthless LOL...on my lunch though I managed to sleep for about 30 minutes...and that totally refreshed me. I have a new toy at work! It's sooo cool. Part of my 'job' is to fold hundreds of invoices everyday and mail them out. Well it takes FOOOOREVER! And today when I got back from lunch, urlLink Pitney Bowes was there with a urlLink folding machine . It did an hour and a half of my work in about 20 minutes...so I had time to get all caught up on my other stuff...so that improved my day A TON! I felt muuuuch better after that was taken care of. Anyway--I can only imagine what people are thinking "Good Golly, is all she has to talk about a folding machine??? " UGH! It seems that I have no time these days :-( Not for anything. Halloween is on Thursday...anyone going to dress up? Not me! We're having a big to-do at work over it, with a luncheon and a costume party and stuff...I'll probably go to the lunch to socialize, but I'm not going to dress up. The last time I dressed for Halloween was 5 years ago when my darling friends dressed me up as the Grim Reaper...it was a cheesy costume, but a definete fun party *smile* I started a urlLink yahoo! group last weekend and haven't had any time to play with it or really promote it. Everything has just been so hectic around here it seems. Sunday night we were at Disneyland and we ended up staying late to see the end of the world series! The Anaheim Angels won, and Edison Field...where they won, was only like 2 or 3 miles from Disneyland...there were hundreds of people sitting outside Disneyland watching it on a huge jumbo-tron and when they won the entire crowd erupted and started cheering. It was really fun and probably the neatest thing I've been a part of. What was even cooler was when we were leaving the park, we could look over and see Edison Field still all lit up...it was just a cool feeling being so close to such an awesome event. Anyway--Hannah is almost done with her bath, so I need to go get her bed-time stuff ready. She's still taking the amoxycillan for her ear infection, she really likes the pink bubble gum flavor, so that's an easy task at night! She takes it right out of the little medicine dropper with no fuss.
my latest attempt at something fun OK...so I'm in a number of yahoo groups...and none of them are blog related, but since blogs are the newest thing on the internet pretty much, everyone has been posting in groups asking advice and questions and talking about blogs and it's irritating some of the other members...who want to keep it topic related or whatever. SO I thought...why not make a group just for bloggers??? So here it is... urlLink Click to subscribe to bloggersanonymous Come join me! I'm the only member so far and it's sad and lonely in there!
I'm spending WAAAY too much time online tonight! OK tonight I changed my email address!!! Click on "contact" to send me an email at my new address if you'd like. Other than that not much going on! OOOH I did get to chat with my friends mom tonight! I know...sounds weird huh? But this woman was like another mom to me when I was in Junior High/High School...her daughter and I and Jean were best friends and got into a little bit of mischief together. Judy is great though and I haven't talked to her in almost 4 years...so it was nice chatting with her!!! Now if I could only be online at the same time as Rashaun!!! We watched Game Six tonight! I wasn't really wanting to watch it, but then it got really exciting with the urlLink Angels rallying back from a 5-0 score. Way to go! As long as Barry Bonds doesn't get his ring, I don't care who wins LOL. Anyway--I'm off to spend time with Deane now that Hannah is in bed! We are going to be at urlLink Disneyland all day tomorrow. Have a great day tomorrow y'all!!!
soooooo overworked! Just kidding...I'm probably the least worked person in the world. Today we were in the urlLink "Valley" (Like...DUH) and as we're driving down a street heavily laden with construction...so much so...that the usually 3 lane street is down to one...anyway, we're driving down it and all of a sudden we hear a HOOONK and we look behind us and a saturn station wagon (brand new of course...I mean...why do this in an OLD car?) is trying to sneak between the construction line and a brand new Toyota Rav 4...the Rav honks at it and as the saturn pulls up next to us we see that the passenger side mirror is hanging off and as Deane is saying "Gosh, I wonder how THAT happened?" (Not knowing it had just happened...) the driver gets out of the saturn (leaving it in constructions way of course)...and starts talking to the Rav 4 about the huge scratch she just put in the door of the Rav...DUUUUUUUUH...anyone ever here the urlLink Bill Engvall comedy "Here's Your Sign"...yeah that lady definetly needed a sign. I wanted to lean out the window and say "HEY DUMB-ASS--if you need an eyewitness account of what a MORON you are...let me know!" but I kept my mouth shut. Is life going by quickly for anyone besides me? It seems like yesterday I was doing the Friday Five...and here it is...another Friday gone by (I'm not doing the Five this week...just too tired :-) It just seems like everything is going by so fast and I have no idea why. Halloween is less than a week away! It feels like we just moved here, and it's been over a year already. Last time I lived here in LA, seemed like a flickin' eternity! It must be that I'm just muuuuuuuch happier this time and not as homesick or paranoid. *sigh* I just wish it was the opposite...when you're unhappy life should fly by and when you're happy it shoudl go slower so you can enjoy it more...right? Deane took Hannah for a walk. He's never done that. This time he has motivation though. One of his friends from High School has a sister moving into our complex today and she's over there helping her sister...we saw them at urlLink Costco this afternoon...so he's over looking for them...it's so nice and quiet here! No TV on...no baby running around like a little tornado...none of that! And I'm on the computer...*sigh* Oh well. Better than nothing. I should be cleaning, but I haven't been alone in a looong time, so I'm eating it up. I'll clean when they get back. We had soooo many errands to do today! It felt like a full day! YAY! I love those days where you're not stressed out, but you have a full schedule. When you're done with all your errands you feel like you've just cleaned off your dining room table!!! I feel like we accomplished everything we needed to do with time to spare! We ate at urlLink Tommy's today too...mmmmmmm it was yummy. Way too much food though. Deane and the monkey-toes are back!!! They found his friend Victoria! Her sister is moving into an apartment not far from us! (Our complex is huuuuuuge.) Anyway--time to get going. I'm sooooo thirsty!!! I found some cool blinkie sites this morning. I don't know how to link them to my blog though, so I have like 20 blinkies in a folder on my computer, and as soon as I find a site that will let me host them there and link to them here, I'll set my site up with some. Although, I know I said I wasn't going to do that to my blog...but I don't want to do it to my website either...blinkies just seem like they belong in blogs anyway. We'll see. I even have some borrowed blinkies from urlLink Jennie's blog, but just don't have the time, the patience or the know-how to put them up here! Have a funny sunny Sunday!
doctors, pedialyte and expensive baby medicine...welcome to my world... I remember one time when I was in HS and I was chatting with a guy that lived in Canada, I was on this eating trip where all I wanted to eat was urlLink "Munch'ems" So when I went to send him an email and had no idea what to "subject" the email, I used the word Munch'ems...he loved it and told me what a cool idea it was to just use random words for subjects in emails...and yes...I AM A MUNCH MASTER!!! :-) Anyway--I don't know what made me think of that...I think about it everytime I send an email though and I always laugh...*shrug* Today we took Hannah to the doctors!!! Yesterday we were informed by her babysitter that we needed to bring her medicine with her to daycare or she wouldn't be allowed in. So we took her in today and told the doctor that the babysitter thought it was pink-eye and all that...but that we didn't really believe her because her eye wasn't PINK...duh babysitter. Anyway...it turned out that Hannah just has an urlLink ear infection . Most babies have a really hard time dealing with an ear infection, but Hannah hasn't cried or thrown too many fits or been unable to sleep because of it...so an ear infection was the least of what we thought was wrong. We have some antibiotics for her now though and we spent a tooooon of money on pedialyte, pediacare and vicks vapor stuff for her humidifier. I felt like such a parent tonight standing in the medicine aisle at urlLink Albertson's buying cold stuff for her...I could hear other parents there with their coughy sneezy little kids and I felt like I really could relate to them LOL...it's a weird feeling being a parent. I'm glad it wasn't pink-eye though...I sort of knew it wasn't...but wasn't sure since I've never seen it before...and who I am really to argue with a babysitter who's been watching kids for 22 years? She's supposedly an expert right? Apparently not. *sigh* I saw my boss in Albertson's tonight. I didnt' go to work today, but when she saw me she immediately asked about Hannah and how she was doing, so I know I won't be in any sort of trouble for staying home...after all...we thought it was pink-eye...ihck right? That's why I'm glad I have a female boss...no offense to the guys that might read this...but women are always more understanding about sick children than men are...even when the men have their own children...so I'm thankful I have a boss who's been through it twice with her own boys...she also said that everyone missed me today, so that made me feel good *smile* Anyway--tonight I'm making a chicken pasta with french fries. So I better get going...it's 8 p.m. here!
no subject really I tried posting yesterday but our internet was all funky and wouldn't stay connected for too long, I had a long post all written and when I hit submit, the bleepin computer froze and I lost my internet connection. I got all pissy and upset and stomped off and Deane asked if he'd like me to fix it and I told him to take the damn thing and....oh...wait...that's not what happened at all...that's what I IMAGINED happened...anyway-- I've been working on tax audit stuff at work and I swear my eyes are all buggy and warped from all the percentages and tax codes I've been entering. Yikes huh? Yeah. Just what you want to hear about...tax auditing...*sigh* Tonight I'm making spaghetti for dinner. yum! Lastnight I made yummy yummy chicken marsala...not the sweet kind either, this stuff tasted sort of salty and was mmmmmmdelicious! BUT if you want really good Chicken Marsala or really good anything...try either urlLink OSF (The Old Spaghetti Factory) or urlLink The Cheesecake Factory . OK I'm talking about food...AND TAX AUDITS...ugh. This rates as the most boring blog EVER! Hannah may or may not have urlLink Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye) . I've been researching it. Her eyes just have a green goonky build-up in them...no pinkness or swollenness Anyway--off to make dinner! Have fun reading the boringest boring blog EVER!
a halloweenie party! YAY! I am getting more excited about the party tomorrow! It promises to be fun! I want to see Hannah all dressed in her little Winnie The Pooh outfit! Tonight we were going to go over to the Commons in Calabasas to hang out and go to the book store and stuff...but one thing led to another, and I think Deane may have gotten caught up on the computer a little bit *too* long, so we just didn't go. Kind of a let-down...but such is life these days...letting me down. Oh, well. Brighter days ahead? Possibly! UGH For some reason Diet 7-UP is TOTALLY giving me the hiccups tonight! I tried sipping it slowly and I still *H*I*C*C*U*P* everytime I take a drink. *sigh* I don't have much to say...my life is pretty un-eventful...OK IT'S BORING...I'll just come out and say it...MY LIFE IS BORING OK? Get over it...I have. *smile* Time to go. Deane is in the living room singing...THE MADNESS I TELL YOU!
the friday five 1. How many TVs do you have in your home? We have two TVs'...one in the living room and one in the bedroom. 2. On average, how much TV do you watch in a week? Probably too much TV...the 3 or 4 hours that I'm at home and awake I probably spend most of it with the TV on...whether I'm paying attention to what is on or not is something totally different. 3. Do you feel that television is bad for young children? Only if it's the wrong kind of TV...Like I wouldn't let Hannah watch TV shows like Friends, or Simpsons, or Will and Grace or some of the other shows I watch...too grown up. She can watch some shows on the discovery channel...and disney movies. 4. What TV shows do you absolutely HAVE to watch, and if you miss them, you're heartbroken? Hmmm...I just talked about this lastnight...but OK. I normally HAVE to watch TV on Thursdays...that's when Friends, Scrubs, CSI and Without a Trace are on. Once in awhile I'll watch 3rd Watch, Will and Grace and ER...and occasionally Crossing Jordan...but those aren't "must haves." 5. If you had the power to create your own television network, what would your line-up look like? Hmmm...Ive never really thought of it. I guess I'd have to say that I'd pick comedies and more movies that are true stories...like more movies based on books like the ones Ann Rule writes... Here's a question... WHY DOES THE FRIDAY FIVE GET MORE BORING EVERY FRIDAY?
OWWWIEEE!!! OK so here's a smart idea--don't take a big bite of ANYTHING that just came out of the oven! Oh MAN my tongue is sooooooo burned now! *sigh* Anyway--I'm sooo excited about tomorrow. Just because it's Friday. ugh...I need a weekend. I picked up the costumes for Hannah today! She gave me two of them in case one didn't fit. One of them is an Eeyore one that has a little thing in it so when you squeeze his hand, he talks!!! It's too big though. We made her try on the Winnie The Pooh-Bumble Bee outfit and it fits and is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo incredibly adorably cute on her! She got mad at us because we were laughing and saying how cute she was, so she sat down and started rolling around on the floor trying to get it off...*sigh* I love babies! LOL Anyway--tonight was TV night here...the only shows I really are into are on Thursdays and they were all pretty good...but now I'm tired and think I"m gonna go crawl into bed after I finish making a cd on the other computer!
*smack* I didn't post lastnight! I blog hopped a bit and caught up on all the goings-ons in bloggie-land...but was toooo tired to write anything myself. I was in bed BEFORE 8 p.m. and slept until my alarm went off this morning! *YAAAWN* *STREEEEETCH* I feel better today though and the dark droopy circles under my eyes arent' as dark and droopy today! Someone at work, a wonderul person I should say, has agreed to let Hannah borrow a halloween costume! AND the great news is, that it's a costume we were already considering getting for her ANYWAY...so it's not like we wanted her to be a princess and someone said "OH I've got a cute kitty outfit she can wear!" We wanted her to be Eeyore or Winnie The Pooh and my friend has a Winnie The Pooh Bumble Bee costume that her daughter wore two years ago! So *whew* huge sigh of relief. I'm excited! Anyway--it's been so dreary and foggy and overcast and yucky out...but NO RAIN YET! I'm so bummed. I want it to pooooooour! PLEASE LET IT RAIN!!! :-)
mmmmm chocolatey goodness OK so tonight was fun. We had an unexpected invite over to dinner at Deane's family's house. They are great wuuuunderful people! His sis-in-law made pork chops and she cooked them "chinese" sort of...they had soy and ginger sauce over them and turned out really yummy. **SHHHH** Deane isn't a big fan of pork, but he ate it anyway because he's a good and decent man *smile* Hannah even ate a bunch of it, and broccoli and baked potato too...I was proud of my little family! After that we finished watching the NLCS and I almost DIED when the Giants took it...I soooo don't want Barry Bonds to get a world series ring...he's the least deserving of a WS Ring than any other player on the face of this earth!!! Oh well. Then we saw the Seahawks give up the lead on MNF and lose to the 49er's...I feel sorry for Seattle Seahawks fan...just when they start having something to look forward to...they lose...again...lol. J/K...I guess they aren't ALL that bad...just pretty bad... Anyway--his sis-in-law sent us home with yummy-hot-fresh-baked-chocolate-chip-cookies...what KIIIND were they you ask??? urlLink NESTLE of course!!! Deane's family supports him so well!!! *smile* For those of you that haven't figured it out...Deane works for Nestle LOL... Lastnight we watched one of Deane's birthday presents. His friend Joe got him the DVD collection of the urlLink "Young Ones" it's a british comedy and I'd only ever seen one episode, but the collection has ever "stoopid episode" on a 3 disc collection...Deane loves the show and was really excited when he opened his gift (Thanks Joe!) He also got urlLink "UHF" with Weird Al...and urlLink "Airplane" . So I'm sure our week will be full of movies! They're all good very funny movies though!!! Anyway--I'm off to tuck Hannah in with Deane. Nightie's!!!
hmph I got tired of looking at my delipidated website...so I deleted it. Then I put together a very simple one that won't require nearly as much work and effort. You can check it out urlLink here . I just got tired of it being such a chore to update and keep maintained. I'm putting it back the way it was five years ago when I first started it! Just a simple site with some pictures and a little information about me and my story. I've been dedicating a lot of time to my blog anyway...so hopefully this will be my "main" page or whatever. We'll see!
SPECIAL BULLETIN HAPPY BIRTHDAY SHMOOOOOPY!!! I LOVIE YOU SO SO SO MUCH!!!!!! (this text blinks in Netscape LOL)
strange little quiz This is a funny little weird quiz I've stumbled on :-) urlLink You are a very intense person. Most people find you hard to understand but those who know you well love you to bits. urlLink Which Blogging Tool Are You?
my mommy I found out that my mom does in fact read my blog! Which is good, because I feel bad for not writing her as often. She accused me of being too busy for her...hopefully she was kidding...I think she was. I don't have time for anything these days though. Hannah is pretty much a monster and my job completely drains me of wanting to do anything. I spend all day in front of a computer, typing stuff, helping customers and stuff, the last thing I feel like doing when I come home is writing some more...so that's why I keep this blog...one entry is better than writing 4 or 5 emails and this way everyone gets the same information! She has a blog now though! SHe started it this morning. I made a link to it on the side with my other links. I'm DYING to get into her HTML and make links and put up tagboard and imood and a comments section LOL...I'm sure that's all she needs...heh heh heh... I have sort of an interesting topic of interest for my readers... Have you ever noticed when you're on the freeway and you KNOW nobody is doing the speed limit (which here it's 65 on most freeways)...and a cop pulls someone over out of the crowd of 10 cars all doing 90? How do you think he decides which one to pull over? We know he can't pull EVERYONE over...but how does he pick that ONE car? That always puzzles me when we're on the freeway and I see someone pulled over on the side of the road and I wonder "Hmmm...what did he do to get picked out of the crowd of speed-limit violators?" Interesting huh? Yeah, I think it is. I can't think of anybody that I know who actually obeys the speed limits on a freeway...*puzzled look* I think I'll go ponder this some more.
friday five on saturday OK so I had this Friday Five aaaaall typed out last night and when I hit post and publish...my internet connection died...ugh. So here it goes...AGAIN... 1. If you could only choose 1 cd to ever listen to again, what would it be? Ooooh probably one of my Chris LeDoux cd's. I know I don't listen to Country as much as I used to, and my music tastes have evolved quite a bit...but he's still my hero and I still love his music!!! 2. If you could only choose 2 movies to watch ever again, what would they be? This one is easy...Dumb Dumber and Journey of Natty Gann... 3. If you could only choose 3 books to read ever again, what would they be? Hmmm...definetly one of Ann Rules books...which one I don't know since they're all good...and then probably Wizard of Oz...YES THE BOOK...and White Fang...all good books! 4. If you could only choose 4 things to eat or drink ever again, what would they be? Hmmm...iced tea, fajitas, my mom's fried chicken and Chili's Chicken Ranch Sandwich (w/o the tangy sauce.) 5. If you could only choose 5 people to ever be/talk/associate/whatever with ever again, who would they be? The person I would like to be: Faith Hill The person I would like to talk to: My fiance, Deane The person I would like to associate with: My best friend, Jean The person I would like to see again: My brother The person I wish I could spend more time with: My neice Heilee
mmmmmm the weekend! I'll probably have to do the Friday Five tomorrow...but I'll check it out and see what it is and then decide if I'll do it at all. Anyway--Tonight was Deane's surprise dinner birthday party at urlLink Chili's. I ended up breaking down and telling him about it this morning though, because I thought he had changed his mind about having dinner out tonight and I couldn't think of an aggressive way to make him go except for "OTHER PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED...YOU HAVE TO GO!" hehehehehe...besides, I suck at surprises and I think he knew the whole time and was merely humoring me. *ahem* ANYWAY--we had a great time. It was a wide range of friends...one that he's known since Elemantary school, one that he's known since high school and one that he's been friends with since he started at Nestle 3 years ago! But everyone got along well and had a good time...there were two little boys there both around the same age, and so it was easy to keep the conversation going because if it slowed down at all, the little boys would entertain us...as well as Hannah :-) So if any of the people in attendance tonight happen along my lonely little blog--thank you all for coming :-) All of you are wonderful people that we love to death...thank you for coming and sharing tonight with us (And for driving aaaaaaall the way out to Simi Valley for it!!!) I had another surprise planned for tomorrow, but financial stuff happened and now we'll have to postpone that for a couple of weeks...but he doesn't have ANY idea what this part of his birthday surprise is...so it will actually BE a surprise...unless I spill the beans again LOL...I really am fun at Christmas time...I can't keep a secret for anything and can be bought and sold for nothing!!! hehehehehe...ask my mom...LOL Anyway--Hannah is in bed now and has cried herself out and *knock on wood* is now asleep...so I'm gonna go to bed myself!!! Goodnight!
*yaaaaaaaaaawn* OK So I should soooo be in bed right now...but for some reason...I'm just not! This is probably the first time all week that Hannah has cried herself to sleep...which is incredibly nice. She used to be so so good about going to bed, but this week it's almost like "Who's baby is this? Ours doesn't cry this much!" UGH! So we're having a nice break tonight! I watched Friends, Scrubs, and CSI and now I'm watching Without A Trace. Scrubs is still one of those shows that make me scratch my head. I can't make up my mind about it. Sometimes I think it's really funny and really good and other times I see it and think "Oh man, please...give me a break." I watch it mostly as a space filler between Friends and CSI....and also because I'm curious about how crazy it will be! Lastnight when I said "I'm not going to post anything about Deane's birthday because I don' t know if he reads this or not" Was actually a very good bet! I fell asleep shortly after I wrote that and this morning he said "Hey! Lastnight I caught up on your blog! Good thing you decided to post any secret plans for this weekend!" LOL...good timing. He told me tonight that nobody has really done anything "special" for him on his birthday since his 21st birthday...or so he says...but that made me feel good anyway and makes me really want to make this one special special special!!! Any ideas? EMAIL THEM TO ME! Anyway--yeah, I'm feeling sleepy. So it's off to sleepy land for me!!!
Congratulations, you're Seattle, the Emerald City. What US city are you? urlLink Take the quiz by urlLink Girlwithagun . Contrary to popular opinion, Seattle is not as rainy as legend says. It is in fact a charmning green jewel with sparkling cerulean water and verdant hills. Its isolation has made it home to free-thinking and independent individuals. Despite being having the most millionaires per capita, it still has a small town atmosphere. A small town with lots of coffee that is. Java is an art there. Perhaps it is the coffee that has caused this city to give birth to twisted cartoonists and rock stars. YAY! I didn't cheat on this at all and I got Seattle! I love Seattle! I miss Seattle...I miss my family! UGH! I WANT TO GO HOME AND SEE MY FAMILY AND SEE SEATTLE and drink Tully's coffee and have lunch at Seattle Sourdough and walk through Pioneer Square and the Center. *SigH* UGH...
urlLink Which Smiley are urlLink You? Created by urlLink Jessi .
mmmmm Rolo's! It's so funny how life does this...just the other day I wrote about how I wished I had learned more Spanish in school...and today I walk into the lunch room to get a soda and there are two coworkers sitting there with an "English To Spanish" book studying...it turns out they are both Spanish majors at the university...funny stuff. They were writing a letter in Spanish...pretty funny. I'm sure anyone who's first language is Spanish would've laughed their noses off listening to the pronunciations! *smile* Anyway--I'm glad there are people that agree with me about the days of the week! It's weird how stuff like that can really sort of almost mess with your head! We're watching the ALCS...I'm actually rooting for the urlLink Angels ...I figured that since urlLink my team isnt' in it at ALL this year...I should root for the next best...and since I'm IN LA and all...my best bet would be to go for the Angels! As you can see, I don't have a whole lot to say. Again, I'm just so tired and so exhausted that I really have a hard time focusing. To make it a bit worse, I offered to switch schedules with Moe tomorrow because she has an appt. with her sons teacher at 8a.m...so I offered to give her my schedule (8:30-5:30) and I'd take hers (7:00-4:00) I loooove her schedule though...getting off work at 4 is sooo sooo sooo nice! But I have to get up at like 4:30 or 4:45 because Deane gets ready at the same time. *sigh* I'm sure nobody cares about my schedule though *smile* Today I picked up some discount coupons for urlLink Knotts Berry Farm as well as their urlLink Knotts Scary Farm attractions. Hopefully we can make it this year. I've wanted to go forEVER! (Or atleast as long as I've lived down here!) But we've either not been able to afford it or not had the time...so maybe we can get a babysitter for this year and we can go. That would be fuuuun! Deane's birthday is on Sunday--he'll be 3-------0......wow huh? 30...I have plans for him this weekend, but since I don't know if he reads this or not, I'm not going to make any posts about it until after it's all over. Anyway--sounds like Hannah is done with her bath, so I'll go help Deane find clothes for her and then tuck her into bed. Goodnighties!
awwww...it's Wednesday! And thank Goodness for that! Tuesdays are my least favorite day. Most people would say "WHAT? Why not Monday?" Ummm...well...because after awhile you just LEARN to deal with a Monday...but Tuesdays...there's no way to deal with them. You have nothing to look forward to, because you still have 3 days left after Tuesday...and by now you're brain is already back focussed on work...whereas on Monday, you can still reminisce about the weekend a little. Wednesdays...or Hump Day...are great though...they always fly by...and even though you're focused on work...you start thinking about the weekend, which makes Thursday go by quickly...and Fridays are pretty good too, although they tend to drag by a bit because you're right on the edge of your weekend...but BECAUSE it's the edge of your weekend, that makes up for the slow day! Anyway--lastnight I was way too tired to write in this thing. Hannah was too! She was in bed at 6:45! Deane woke her up at 8 though so she could have a bath and eat something, but it never happened, she was so tired, we put her back in bed at 8:20 and she slept aaaaaaall night! I was in bed before 9 even! I didn't fall asleep until 10 or 10:30...but atleast I got to rest and watch a movie! I'll write more tonight...I have to put shoes on and go to work... Have a happy Wednesday!!!
friday five on a monday night OK so I'm about 3 days late...but better late than never right? 1. What size shoe do you wear? Size 10...in a dress shoe though, I can wear anything from a size 9 to an 11...as long as it's a "wide" foot shoe. 2. How many pairs of shoes do you own? *groan* I always thought I didn't have a shoe fetish, but the other day I was going through my closet and found about 11 pairs of shoes...with more in the spare closet in Hannah's room. I only have about 3 pair that I wear regularly though. 3. What type of shoe do you prefer (boots, sneakers, pumps, etc.)? I prefer sneakers or sandals...although normally just sneakers. 4. Describe your favorite pair of shoes. Why are they your favorite? My favorite pair of shoes has been gone for a very long time! Ask my mom! I had a pair of low-top nike's...white and blue and purple...I wore them from 8th grade until about 3 years ago...when they finally got huge holes in the sides of them. I STILL didn't want to throw them away, but my mom made me *smile* They were my favorite because they just became a part of me...you know how they get soooo comfy? They get to the point where they just fit your feet so perfectly and feel so good when you slip them on...*teary eyed* I miss those shoes! I haven't found another pair of shoes that good since then. 5. What's the most you've spent on one pair of shoes? Hmmmm...probably in High School when I was wearing "ropers" (cowboy boots)...they were between $60 and $80...
blah, blah, blah For lack of a better title, I thought "blah" worked fine! Hope everyone had a great fantasmic weekend! We went to a wedding on Saturday and then on Sunday drove to Disneyland, I realize we were just there a week ago, but they Holiday Haunted Mansion opened this weekend and we had to check it out!!! So we did...so be quiet and stop makin' fun of me! Anyway, today at work I realized that I have ONE regret...not learning Spanish...isn't that weird? Yeah, I know. I was forced to take two semesters of it in HS and don't remember a thing! Oh, except "Mi llamo es Sarah..." Whatever. I think it would be fun to take a course on it and learn some basic stuff...Right? We were in Long Beach on Saturday for the above mentioned wedding, and I looked out at the harbor and saw all the tanker ships at rest out there, and it looked like an entire navy of boats out there waiting to attack LA...luckily it's just a bunch of tanker ships...sadly though, all the longshoremen are locked out which is really going to raise prices of merchandise and other things at Holiday Shopping Time! I've been absent in writing...why? I don't know. I do this sometimes with journals and other writings...I get going going going on it, and then start fuzzing out on it...hopefully though, I can pick back up again and find some time every night to write here...since I know a lot of my friends are reading this now...*YIKES THE PRESSURE!* Anyway--tonight after work, I took Hannah outside to play in the courtyard with her Fisher Price wagon and all she wanted to do was sit down in the mud. *SIGH* in her pretty pink capri pants and her white shirt. *double sigh* Whatta kid. As soon as I walked in the door tonight, I took one look at her and said "GET IN THE TUB!" So I gave her a bath and cleaned her up and then took her outside to play...in the mud...luckily she stayed clean and all we had to to do was rinse off her shoes and her wagon...which I still have to do...I hope Deane doesn't let her play with it before I get the chance to clean off the mud...not like our carpet needs more stains...*sigh* Off to clean the wagon and make dinner! I'll try to find a picture of it online...it's the coolest little wagon EVER!!! *smile*
things to ponder... OK I took this from urlLink Kamie's Blog ...who took it from urlLink Jennie's Blog ...who took it from urlLink Chocolate Orange . But I figured I'd do it too, because it's interesting!!! I am a fun person I think my child is brilliant I know that life isn't that bad I want to get married on the ocean I have NO free time I wish I HAD free time I hate being mistreated I miss my family I fear that I will fail if I try new things I hear Deane singing a Sting song I wonder where I'll be in a year I regret trusting my sister when I was younger I love my life I ache after working out I care about homeless people...even though I pretend not to... I always groan when the alarm goes off I am a very funny person I dance only if Hell were to freeze over I sing like a dying cat I cry when an animal on TV dies I do not always act responsibly I fight with my own insecurities I write down my thoughts more now than when I was younger I win EVERYTHING! I lose track of time I confuse dates and times more than I admit to... I listen to country music still I can tell you what happens in almost every episode of "Friends" I need new shoes I am happy when I'm with Deane I should go to bed now Goodnight!
sooooo nice It just feels nice to interact with other people...and I don't mean people at work, where all we talk about is..........work...I mean, I love my coworkers, love our crazy conversations and silly jokes...but going out to dinner, socializing, mingling, interacting...is just soooooo...nice...pleasant...wonderfully fuzzy! I thought for sure we'd have a Mt. St. Hannah on our hands tonight though. Normally she has a bath around 8 and then is in bed by 9...but tonight we didn't leave for dinner until 8...so when we were ordering our food ... Hannah was thinking ... "hmmm...I'm tired!" But she did excellent. I did a good job of keeping her mind off of being sleepy...I fed her all kinds of new foods, gave her apple juice, iced tea Anyway--it's off to bed! Goodnight!
hi diddley ho! OK so I watch WAY to much Simpsons if I'm quoting Flanders!!! Anyway--still no rain--frickin' frackin' confusin' weather!!! Today was an interesting day at work...to say the least. The lady I work with went home sick around lunch time, so when I got out of my afternoon meeting, I was by myself and as soon as I sat down, the doo-doo hit the fan-fan...ugh. The paramedics had to come because someone in our warehouse had problems breathing or something...after they left (and raided our halloween candy LOL)...the main door to our building broke...now see...here's the thing...we all have badges that we wave in front of a little box when we want in the building, and that unlocks the door for us (security)...and when we have a visitor, they ring a "door bell" and it rings into our phone and we decide if they can come in or not (ooooh talk about POWER! RARRR!!!) well...that whole system went down this afternoon...so not only was I alone at the front desk, but I was answering the phones, and walking back and forth to the door letting in employees and customers all afternoon...I swear I lost 10 lbs. just walking back and forth. Not to mention we had a ton of power outages today! It was such a weird wacky day...*sigh* hopefully tomorrow will be better... Tonight we are having dinner with one of Deane's best friends from High School. We're both looking forward to it, not only because we haven't seen him in a loooong time, and hes' never met Hannah...but it also means we are going to either eat at Chili's, Elephant Bar, or Mimi's Cafe...three of our favorite places to go!!! *smile* Anyway--I'm off to finish getting purdified!!! Ciao!
pleeeease let it raaaain!!! Let it pour...please God...let it rain for days and days and DAAAAAAYS!!! It's been such wishy-washy weather here lately. One day it'll be cloudy and windy and cold and the next it'll be sunny and windy and then sunny and warm...and then back to cloudy and windy. It looks like the clouds want to burst, but they won't!!! PLEAAAASE RAIN!!! Tonight I made a poster with PSP for a friend of mine at work who is a huge Oakland A's fan...it says "The Hunt For Green October" on it and it has the original A's logo on it. The pring quality pretty much sucks, but she'll be happy with it anyway! I'll email her the original copy just so she can see what it's "supposed" to look like. After work today we went shopping and I got a suit! Weird huh? Yeah, I thought so. I just needed an outfit to wear to the wedding on Saturday and I really wanted a pant suit, but I settled on a black and blue pinstripe suit with a skirt that falls down to my knees. I really like it and I can wear other places as well...I've never bought such a businessy type outfit though, so I felt a little awkward :-) I almost got a grey pinstripe suit like the ones Kirstie Alley wore on her short lived TV Show...Veronicas Closet...I really liked it, but the jacket was a little too big and ballooned out on the sides and made me look fatter than I am...*smile* I don't need any help looking over weight thank you very much! OOOH I think my hunny just solved the print problem with Moe's poster...ooooh...neat-o...my new hero... Goodnighties everyone!
****shiiiiiiiver**** OK...so I'm sitting here and all of a sudden I get a shiver down my spine...totally creepy. I'm not even cold. UGH. Funny story--I took a nap and after I woke up, I took a shower so we could go shopping. And earlier I baked a ton of those chocolate fudge cookies...so I get out of the shower and Deane looks over at Hannah and says "Oh my GOD look at her Sarah!" So I look over...she's standing there with chocolate ALL OVER her face and she's got two huuuuge cookies...one in each hand of course and she's got this big chocolatey smile on her face and she holds the cookies up and starts giggling like she just got away with the world's perfect crime. It was hilarious!!! Too funny. Anyway--we had a quiet day. We went to Target tonight to get some diapers for the munchkin and ended up getting some safety items as well...cabinet locks, plug-in protectors and some other stuff too. Earlier today we were spraying Febreze and noticed we were almost out so I said "We can get more when we go to Target" so we get to Target (like 5 hours later) and couldn't, for the LIFE OF US, remember what the Hell we needed...all we could remember was me standing at the sink saying "That's ok, we can get more at Target" UUUUUUGH...so about 20 minutes ago Deane walks out of the bedroom with something behind his back and says "If I tell you what we forgot at Target will you buy it?" and I said sure so he pulls the Febreze out and I almost diiiiiiiiiiiied. UGH. I hate those stupid brain lapses. No plans as of yet for tomorrow. We did comment tonight though on how much more we've been doing stuff. It feels good to be out and about. Even with not so much money, we still find things to entertain us. It's much more refreshing then just staying indoors being depressed. So we're all proud of ourselves!!! Take care y'all!!!
mmmmm double chocolate fudge cookies Yes, I was right...they are as good as they sound...mmmm...I should look and see if they can be purchased online. My supervisor's son was selling them through a school project...but they're sooo yummy I don't know if I can wait another year for more LOL. Hannah is being soooo sweet and sooo cuddly today. This morning I was sitting on the floor and she kept running up behind me and giving me a hug from behind...she's the greatest! Today it's cloudy and cold out...it feels like winter...I'm so excited. I love it!!! Now if it would snow life would be perfect!!! I got an email from my friend Anne this morning...her dog got ran over by a car and died :-( When we were in High SChool she found this puppy at the pound and me and Jean went with her to pick it up...it was the smelliest dog ever because it had been homeless, but she cleaned her up and took her home and she's had her for like 4 or 5 years...it's sad :-( Anyway--not much else to post. Today is a lazy lazy day around here...which is actually fun. I've been playing Play Station all morning...I haven't played any of our video games in several months and for some reason all of a sudden I suck LOL...hehehehe Take care! Have a happy Friday!!!
ohhhh whatta world...whatta world... Isn't this like the 100th time Michael Jordan is urlLink retiring ? Gosh, retire already...and here's an idea...once you do...DONT MAKE A COME BACK FOOOOOOOOOOUR TIMES....good lord...enough already...isn't he like 70 or something? Maybe after you retire as much as him they give a set of steak knives or something...I should ask him. Anywho--Thanksgiving here was good. After we stuffed ourselves on Turkey and other yummy food things, we came home and I baked double chocolate fudge cookies...mmmmmm yes they are as good as they sound...mmmm...then our babysitter came over and we left Hannah in her care while we went to see urlLink The Emperors Club . Good movie. I like movies that don't end the way all movies end...you know...I want the good guy to lose once in awhile...I want the guy to not get the girl everytime...I want the hero to die sometimes...and once in awhile, I don't want the bad guy to turn good...and this movie was it! It was good. Now we're home and Hannah is being her little monkey of herself. Sooo cute. She's got some icky bowel movements lately though...I'd share with you, but it's grossing me out to just think about it...so that's enough of that...I just said to Deane and Hannah "I can't believe you just pooped on me Hannah!" and Deane said "YEAH! That's not how a romantic night out typically ends!" Ugh...the joys of motherhood. LOL I hope you weren't eating while reading that last paragraph... Tomorrow we dont' have a lot of plans...which is ok...just going to relax hopefully. On Sunday we might meet his friend at urlLink Disneyland . I know we just went last weekend, but that always happens to us...we go one weekend and then the next weekend someone invites us to go or something cool opens and we have to go back...good thing we have passes... Goodnight!!! I have nothing more to say!!!
Happy Thanksgiving Blog World! OK I may have a problem LOL...I realized today that I'm either good at sending emails or at posting in my blog...but for some reason I can't do both. Tonight Deane installed urlLink Microsoft Office so I'd have my beloved Microsoft Outlook and could use a pop account instead of yahoo. So I've been playing with that tonight writing emails and setting up my calendar and stuff like that. It's the same program that I used when I worked at urlLink Argosy Cruises and I used it so often that I got to really really like it and after I quit working there, I couldn't get used to another program, so I just used Yahoo...but now...heh heh heh...I love him so much :-) He slaved away all night to install it and work out all the little bugs...how wonderful. Tomorrow we are going to his mom's for dinner. I'm bummed I don't get to see my family, but his family is wonderful too, and I always have a good time with them, so I'm sure it'll turn out fine. It's just hard to think that this will be my second holiday season away from my family...*sigh* Anyway--take care bloggers and have a Happy Turkey Day tomorrow!!! WOO HOO!!! Four day weekend!!!
you're just jealous because the voices talk to ME! OK so I don't actually hear voices...just a funny t-shirt a friend of mine had a long time ago! That and..."Stop pissing me off! I'm running out of places to hide the bodies!" heh heh... *ahem* Anywho...only a day and a half left of work this week! WOO HOOOOO!!! I can't wait for the long weekend. I think it bites that I'm not gonna see my family...but hey, 4 and a half days off has to be a good thing either way right? Right. I thought so. Tonight at like 5:20 my boss came up and said "Do you have Sean's phone number at home? He shipped out a $20,000 order and shipping made a mistake with the freight charges." I said "Yes, let me get it for you out of the computer." So I get it for her and she goes back and calls it and then comes back up and says "I don't think that was the right number, the guy yelled at me and told me I had the wrong number." So we looked it up together and sure enough, it was the right number...so she asked me to call...why? I don't know...maybe because I talk to him more...but anywho...being the glutton for insults and offensive remarks, I called him. This is how it went: "Hello?" "Hello...my name is Sarah P________, and I'm looking for a co-worker of mine at Computer Parts Unlimited, his name is Sean F____, do you know how I can get ahold of him?" "OH Hi Sarah, it's me...Sean." "Great! Donna is looking for you can you hold for a second and I'll transfer you over to her?" ***low murmur*** "Ohhhh...THAT Donna..." We still don't know why he yelled at her and said he wasn't Sean and that she had the wrong number...but we got ahold of him. Kind of strange *smile* Anyway, I have been fighting off a headache aaaaaaaaaall day...and sitting in front of the computer screen probably isn't helping...than again...either was listening to Hannah's whine earlier when she didn't want to go to bed...but we fixed that and I'm sure this will fix itself as soon as I'm done with my stuff online! We went to Disneyland yesterday. I almost freeeeeeeaked out on some dumb...............lady. We were trying to park our stroller so we could get in line for the Jungle Cruise...in order to get to the stroller parking I could've walked aroooooooooound this huge line or cut through it. Deane cut through it and then I asked a lady with like a million kids if I could please just pass through in front of her...not like I wanted cuts or anything. Instead of saying "sure go ahead" she chose to say ABSOLUTELY nothing and pushed her kids forward in line to fill up the gap where I was trying to get through...then the dumb.................lady just stared at me like she was making some sort of stand or something...I wanted to punch............anyway--so I finally yelled across the line at Deane that I would go around. I wanted to yell SOMETHING ELSE...the best part though was after we'd gotten situated and were in line, the line inside the Jungle Cruise is one of those typical windy lines that make you backtrack like a million times and makes you feel like you're standing still. So by the time we got inside, the dumb..................lady was already in line way ahead of us...but the way the line went, she was actually only about 4 feet away from us...so the whole time she was there, I just stood there and stared back at her like she did to me when she was being a...............and wouldn't let me pass through. Stupid dumb.............................lady. Anyway--I think I'm done telling you my "ignorant people encounter" (I have atleast one every time I go to Disneyland) so I'm gonna go *smile*
da dum da dum...da dum da dum...here comes the bride.................... .............................ALL FAT AND WIIIIIIIDE!!! OK that was a cheap shot at myself and PROBABLY a bit on the uncalled for side...however...I do have some good news to sprout. Deane and I have set a tentative wedding date for next May! I'm not going to post the actual date, because if for some reason we change our minds, I don't want to explain it. We do have it picked though. We've also got our guest list finished (just need lots-o-addresses) and also maybe a location picked out. How exciting huh? And you've been wondering what I've been doing all week!!! And while I'm talking about weddings...Congratulations to urlLink Lynn and Rich on their wedding today!!! I hope they had a wonderful day and are enjoying themselves!!! How exciting. Today we went to a birthday party for our friends son. He turned 2 yesterday. It was a lot of fun, and afterwards, since we were again in Deane's old neighborhood he drove me around again and showed me some more places he used to hang out when he was in High School! It was fun and definetly nice to be out and about. We were going to stay overnight down in Anaheim so we could get up early and go to Disneyland, but changed our minds and are now just planning on going tomorrow sometime. This week was just so hectic and busy that I didn't have much time to do any computer stuff. I read other blogs, but didn't do any posting or emailing. That's ok though, atleast I'm busy :-) Deane went to the store just now to get some milk for our grumpy butted daughter, who is now throwing a monster-sized tantrum in her crib. I don't know where she learned it, but somewhere along the daycare line she's picked up smacking and hitting...which is really uncool and mean. So when she gets upset at us, she hits us right in the face!!! It actually does hurt and is just mean. So when she started hitting me, I just put her in her crib so she could cry it out alone. I feel bad because I can hear her, but if she won't stop hitting me and won't listen when I say "no" then I'm not going to put up with it! Cry cry cry. She's good at it. Anyway--I think I ate waaaay to much at the party. I wasn't really hungry and then we got there and I ate a TOOOON of potato chips and some dip and cake and stuff and then we went to a sub place afterwards to get dinner and man oh MAN am I stuffed UUUUUUUUGH!!! Good news though...I think...the pants I just bought at urlLink Costco are too big for me!!! I just bought them like 2 months ago and they're all baggy and stuff...so hopefully that means I'm starving myself enough to lose some weight. OK I'm NOT starving myself (I can only imaging my mom's eye bugging out of her head at the site of reading that) I'm just ... cutting down on what I eat and how much I eat...I still eat a little...just not as much as I used to...which is ok with me. My poor stomach has shrunk though and today I over ate so now I feel bloated and gross. *ugh* OK I have to go get her. She's such a grumpus. Usually she stops crying after about 5 minutes and calms down, but she's still going at it in there, so I'll go get her and save her from throwing up, which she'll eventually do. *sigh* The wonders of parenthood...
here's a self-esteem booster...thanks urlLink Juls! urlLink I haven't posted at all this week, and don't have time right now either, but I'll post after we get home from the birthday party!!! :-) Have a Happy Saturday!
monday mission I saw this on urlLink Kamie's blog and she got it from urlLink here . It looked interesting and since there was no Friday Five last week, I thought I'd try it. 1. Is there anything you used to be able to do physically that you no longer can? What changed? I used to be able to run and do sports, and other phys. ed type activities, but after I broke my ankle, that limited what I could do and then I stopped going to therapy and have lost a bunch of motion in my ankle, so now when I run, it sort of looks like my left leg just sort of thuds along LOL...ok, it's not THAT bad...but that's how it feels when I do anything faster than a walk. 2. If you could go to lunch with someone famous, anyone living or dead, who would you choose? What questions would you ask them? I would go to lunch with hmmm...someone rich of course...probably a celebrity or someone like that. I just want to know what it's like to be that rich and that famous...I mean, how different are they really? What do they do when they aren't in "the limelight"...do they wear sweat pants around the house? Do they do their house cleaning and cooking (some of them DO!!!) Stuff like that...I'm fascinated with it and I don't know why. 3. On that same thought, there are probably several Bloggers you enjoy reading but have never met in real life. Which one Blogger would you most like to meet for dinner? Why did you pick that person? What would you talk about? What do you have in common? What would you do after dinner? Probably either urlLink Kamie . I pick her because she seems like an interesting person that's very intelligent and would be fun to hang out with! We'd probably talk about the same stuff we talk about on here...our husbands, things we like to do, places we've grown up or been...things we have in common...hmmm...we're both from small towns, we're both in relationships with guys we've met online 5 years ago and we're the same age. After dinner...hmmm...probably just hang out somewhere!!! 4. Money (or the lack thereof) is the number one cause of arguments amongst couples. Do you find this to be true? If there really was a "Money Tree" you could go an pick, would this really solve a couple's problems? I don't think Money is the number one cause of arguments in MY relationship...we have money problems, but we dont' tend to argue about them...we agree on things financially and I think we both agree that things could be a lot harder for us. I don't think Money should be the center problem in any relationship and if it is, there are probably bigger problems under the surface. I don't think an endless supply of money would solve any problems...if me and Deane were gabillionaires, we'd still have our other problems...we'd still bicker about "the girl from new york" and we'd still have our other disagreements...riches doesn't change that. 5. Speaking of arguments, have you ever been drawn into any nasty, hateful arguments? The kind where hurtful things were said that had nothing to do with the fight at hand? What was that all about? How did it turn out? I can only think of one...it was right after I broke my ankle...me and Deane got into an argument...I don't want to share it though *smile* 6. When was the last time you had to admit you were wrong about something? How did that go? The last case I can think of was yesterday. Deane was reading my blog and the entry with all the interesting facts on it had one untrue one in it. I don't care! They're funny. But it seemed like he was on a mission to prove to me that I was wrong about it...so he searched the internet for the answer and it turned out the fact was untrue...it just sort of deflated my whole day and made me feel dumb. 7. Now for a slight change of theme....what song should never have been written? That's easy...any song that Leanne Rimes has ever sang...and a new one that's on all the freakin' time called "Unsinkable Ships"...I don't know the guy that sings it, I dont' stick around long enough to find out.
meat sticks? That just SOUNDS gross! Today was Hannah's first day in her new, safe daycare. We've decided to turn her last daycare into Child Welfare...she came home tonight all happy and smiley, when normally she'd come home a bit grumpy and upset...so we really feel like we've done the right thing. I went into the store tonight and bought her some urlLink food for lunches and stuff...the one thing I absolutely will NOT buy for her are the "meat sticks" they look as gross as they sound...I bought her the fruit dices though and she likes though...as well as the microwavable meals and some juice and crackers to pack in her little lunch :-) It's so cute and so fun packing her a lunch. I also got her a new urlLink sippy cup so she'd have one for home and one for daycare. It just seems easier to keep one there and one here...so it doesn't get lost in transit. Anyway-tonight we went over to Frank and Christies and hung out with them. It was so nice to see them! We don't see them very often, they are usually busy these days, but tonight we hung out and Hannah totally showed off. We watched MNF with Frank because his Rams were playing. We left during the 3rd quarter, but the Rams had just urlLink scored another touchdown , so it looked like they had that one wrapped up. My coworker Moe will be quite upset tomorrow I'm sure...if Chicago would've won tonight she would've taken the football pool for the 2nd week in a row...the 3rd time this season...the guys she plays in the pool with are getting really tired of the women winning and some of them are pulling out of it...I think Moe is one of three or four other women that have won the pool this season...whatta bunch of wussy-boys huh? These are women that have played this pool every year for like 3 years and have NEVER won until this year...I say GOOD FOR THE WOMEN!!! LOL...the only time I really ever watch Football is when we're over at Franks...and I admit, I have no idea what's going on, but it gets exciting...especially when Frank starts throwing pillows LOL... Anyway--nightie night bloggie world!!!
... Today was fun! After Deane got back from Palmdale (he went out there to get Hannah a dresser!!!) we went to the urlLink Promenade ...which is where we used to go when we lived in Sherman Oaks, to see all of our movies. But now we only get there once in awhile, and since we have Hannah, it's normally only to window shop *smile* After we browsed urlLink Barnes and Noble we went into urlLink Chick's Sporting Goods and Deane tried on a *GAG* Anaheim Angels hat *GAG* ... after that we goofed around with baseball bats and catchers helmets hehehe... We took Hannah to the Pizza Cookery and saw a total mob family eating dinner...ok...maybe not the mafia...but the grandfather (or "papa" as they called him) could have TOTALLY been a boss. They sat down and as soon as the waiter put their hot rolls down it was like a feeding frenzy at the zoo. There was one little boy that I woulda totally been all about setting straight...little *($% wouldn't last 5 minutes in my house LOL...All we heard out of him was "I can do it...let me do it...give it to me...why are you always taking their sides?" "Papa, why do you always criticize and blame me for everything?" 'Papa's response..."WELL...because you're the one that's always starting crap with your sisters!" The boy than proceeded to get all grumpified because they wouldn't let him have his huge-ass rootbeer all to himself...little whiny-pants. UGH...I've never heard a kid whine or complain or be such a little...*((%%($ in all my life. Anyway--enough of that. After dinner Deane took me up to the top of Topanga Canyon and scared the holy living daylights out of me on the windingest, curviest road I've ever seen in my life. We used to go up there all the time when we lived in Sherman Oaks, but I don't remember it being so scary back then. After we came back down it we drove around in his old neighborhood and he showed me where he went to school, urlLink Saint Mels , until he was in the 8th grade. It was fun driving around listening to his stories *smile* I wish I could take him back to KF and show him around...oh, wait...I did that already and it only took about 20 minutes to show him the whole place *loud knee slapping laugh* Goodnight!!!

*WARNING* MUSHY ENTRY Mmmmmm know how sometimes one little thing can come along and make all your bad icky feelings inside wash away without any notice at all? Lastnight I went to bed all grumpy and feeling sad for everything going on...and then me and Deane cuddled and talked a bit and then we woke up this morning he cuddled with me some more and made me laugh and feel good...and now I feel great again. Maybe I just missed him...*sigh* I feel close to him again though and that makes me feel good :-) On a less mushy note...I was reading this story today...you can read it urlLink here . It's about a tree that's in danger of being cut down to make way for a road into a new housing development. I don't understand it really...I do love trees, they are very pretty and good for the environment...but it is JUST a tree...it's not like a whole forest is getting chopped down or something to make room for the road...just one tree...whatever...maybe I'm not used to the way people are here in California...I grew up hearing about how all the people here were environmentalists (which they are all not like that) who would come to Washington to protest our logging industry...and I grew up, truthfully...not liking Californians *giggle* now I am one (I'm a Californian...not an environmentalist)...how ironic. Funny how life leads you down paths you never thought you'd explore.
slowly coming back to life OK So I'm feeling a little better. Yesterday was rough though...I was sick to my stomach all day and tired and stressed out. Worried sick about Hannah and finding her a new daycare...one that wasn't going to bankrupt us but that would also keep her safe. We found one...it's almost $100 more a week than what we were paying "the chicken-fat lady" ... but anything is better than that environment, and like Deane says "You get what you pay for" so we're definetly willing to shell out that much more money to ensure better safety and a more caring environment for her. Today I felt sick too...not able to keep any food down. I was so tired that my eyes were totally closing on me all morning and my co-worker kept looking over at me and saying "Sarah...are you there? Are you awake?" UGH...so on my lunch break, I slept for 45 minutes and that revived me and kept me going the rest of the day. I am so back-logged at work with stuff that's been sitting on my desk waiting for me to do it, but I've been so tired and sick lately I haven't had the energy to do anything except sit there and moan a little and rub my stomach. One of my friends left work today too *frown* She used to come down everyday at 5 when she'd get off work and talk to me until 5:30 when I get off work...it kept me from going completely insane. She quit though so she could back to school...good for her of course...sad for me *frown* *SiGh* That's about all. Life is just sort of sucking lately and I dont' want to bring everyone down with my sinking ship.
sooooo tired... Yesterday when Deane went to pick Hannah up from Daycare, he saw Hannah and another little kid sitting on a patio unattended...5 or 10 feet from the gate that's usually open that goes out onto the two busy streets...HELLO!!!??? The lady that watches her was very non-chalant about it saying "Oh, gosh...she was here a second ago!" HELLO!!!??? What makes it worse, is now I'm thinking, well if it's happened yesterday, how many OTHER times has it happened? Hmmm...so we're taking her out of this daycare as soon as possible and finding a nicer, cleaner, safer one. I'm really upset about it...whatever. Not much else to post...that's just how life's been going lately.
*I found this on urlLink Julie's Blog . 18.75 % My weblog owns 18.75 % of me. urlLink Does your weblog own you?
not much to say really... Why am I online? Oh yeah...to check email...although normally, my email box is empty *frown* I was just visiting urlLink our friends' website and stuff...but that is about all. Hannah has been grumpy tonight and really hard to be around...which is making things tough for us tonight, so things feel a bit strained. Plus, the depressing realization that we are probably NOT going to see my family AGAIN this year for the Holidays is bringing me down...so I'm just gonna go.
Winnie The Pooh quiz... I saw this on urlLink Kate's Blog tonight and since I LOOOOOOOVE Winnie the Pooh, I thought I'd do it. Although Eeyore is my favorite character...Tigger is my second favorite...so I'm content being like him *smile* Take the 100 Acre Personality Quiz!
mmmmmmmm the smell of rain... I don't know what it is about wind and rain but it smells sooooooo good. urlLink The Santa Anna's are kicking up pretty good tonight and we might get more rain...It was pretty warm and sunny today though...we drove out to Palmdale for a friends daughters 4th birthday party. It was a lot of fun and Hannah fit right in with all the kids there. It's nice to watch her interact with other kids. Her favorite toy though was a pink lawn chair for little kids. She wouldn't sit in it for long, but she'd pull it around behind her all over the place...we wouldn't let her take it upstairs though lol. Since her daughter is 4 now, Victoria had a bunch of toys and a bag of clothes that her daughter wouldn't play with or couldn't wear and she gave them to us...Hannah has enough clothes now to last her until she's 12 lol. She's also giving us a dresser for Hannah...she found out we were keeping them on our spare bed, and she told us to take a dresser that she had in her garage...so that will be soooooo nice when we get that here. Our date lastnight was fun too. We had dinner at urlLink Mimi's Cafe and then we went and saw urlLink Punch Drunk Love . With urlLink Adam Sandler and urlLink Emily Watson . I really liked it...we both did. The movie was really good, really strange and I think that a lot of people wouldn't understand it...but I thought it was good. It was filmed about 4 miles from where we were watching it...so that was funny. Anyway--Deane, my hero, just got Hannah to bed...so I'm going to go stand outside on the balcony in the wind and try not to catch pneumonia...it just smells so good outside :-)
*grumble* I don't want to talk about it. I'm never changing the colors on my blog again. Did you see what I had to do? Totally redo it because somehow, in my boredom, I managed to dismantle my blog and had to put it back together piece by flickin' piece...NEVER AGAIN WITH THE COLOR CHANGES!!! I'm going to bed now to suffer in my own damned misery!!! !!!HMPH!!!
friday five I know that I don't normally do the urlLink Friday Five ...but Deane and Hannah are both in bed and I don't have anyone to play with *frown* so I'm going to play on the computer. 1. Did you vote in your last elections? No, but I AM registered to vote. I registered on September 21st...which made me eligible for the elections this last week...but I didn't know anything about the stuff I'd have been voting for...and didn't want to vote like that...you know...Like I don't care or something...so I think it'd be better not to know and not to vote, then not to know and vote..................but...I guess even better than that would be to know and to vote...but...oh cripes...no, I didn't vote!!! 2. Do you know who your elected representatives are? No...*giggle* I don't even know who the mayor is...and to think I almost worked at City Hall...cripes!!! 3. Have you ever contacted an elected representative? If so, what was it about? I think in my hometown...wonderfully small Kettle Falls...one of our representatives owned the local feed store and I KNOW we used to buy hay and grain there for our horses...so yeah...in a way, I contacted him for SOMETHING...OH and there was one time, in the same, wonderfuly small town, when I lived next to the Governor of my State and his daughters were there visiting him and I took them horse back riding...I don't know if that counts though... 4. Have you ever participated in a demonstration? Uhhh...not really...I've complained a lot with other people...but mostly in High School about crappy homework assignments and stuff... 5. Have you ever volunteered in an election? What was the result? Hmmm...not in like a "big" election. I was a member of 4-H for several years and I ran for club president...AND THE RESULT WAS ME WINNING! WOO HOO! THAT'S RIGHT BABY...I was IN CHARGE!!! YAAAAAH!!! LOL...since then the group has fallen apart and none of us really ride horses anymore...*scratching my head* hmmm...
RAAAAAAAIN YAAAAAAAAY Nothing like rain to pull me out of a deep dark depression...not to mention my cold! The basketball that was in my throat lastnight is gone, but now my nose is pretty runny and my head is a bit light feelin'...but I shall be fine because it's RAINING! It started yesterday on our way out the door in the morning...and rained off and on all day yesterday and then today it rained steadily all day!!! YAY FOR ME! I LOVE RAIN!!! We had power outages lastnight too...just two of them right in a row and luckily we were awake when they hit, so we were able to reset our clocks and wake up on time! I was watching the rain fall all day while I sat behind my desk at work and reeeeeally was achin' to go puddle stompin' in the parking lot like we used to do in High School...er...I mean...uh...Elemantary School... Deane is sick tonight. Kind of a funny story though...tonight when we got done eating urlLink dinner , Deane decided he was going to take a nice hot bath...and he takes REEEALLY hot baths...he's in there for maybe 30-35 minutes...enough to make his legs and arms all red and burned looking...he comes walking out our bedroom holding the thermometer in his hand and says "Sorry, honey...I really need to go to bed...I have a fever..." The thermometer said 100 degrees... HELLO! ...OF COURSE it is!!! You were just in a hoooooooooooot bath!!! LOL When I told him that, he said "No, I've been out of the bath for like 5 minutes..." OK but your legs are still beeeeeat red and your face looks like a lobster!!! Wait like an hour and then decide if you're dying from a fever! *giggle* It was cute. He did go to bed early though...poor baby *frown* I did the same thing lastnight. I got home from work at 5:45 and by 5:53 I was in bed going to sleep! I slept for a few hours, got up, ate some pizza and then went to bed again shortly after...I feel better though as a result of it. Tomorrow we are going on a date! We are leaving Hannah in the trusted hands of a babysitter...the same one that watched her while we went to the wedding in October. And we are going to go see a movie. We never get to see any though...and cripes! I just realized I posted this same thing the last time I posted...OK...I'm leaving :-)
***cough cough*** OK so I've been sneezing more than coughing today...but coughing just looks cooler...anyway, yeah, I'm sick. UGH. We have a babysitter for Saturday night though...so we get to go out to the movies! It'll be the second movie we've seen in the theatre since March of 2001. We don't even know what movies are playing anymore...so we'll have to research that I guess before we go. I'm excited...and then on the 16th, a friend of Deane's is gonna watch her so we can have a night to ourselves with dinner and maybe another movie *fingers crossed* how fun! Two weekends in a row...whatta nice treat...*sigh* My hands are soooo cold. I don't think I'm gonna post much tonight, I need to rest some. I'm very dizzy and a bit funky feeling...sort of wavy...if that makes sense...and I have a really bad sore throat...so I'm gonna go :-)
sooooo glad to be back online OK so I grumbled a bit and maaaaybe threw a teeeeny tiiiiiny fit when Deane spent all Saturday Night and Sunday morning on the computer trying to fix it...but boy, am I glad he did!!! Hannah had three urlLink shots yesterday! Poor little kid, but whatta trooper! Deane gave her some urlLink Infant Tylenol before they left for the appointment to sort of keep her from having another melt down like the one she last January when she had her first shots. Today at work I got soooo sick! I thought I was going to throw up! Ugh! The facilities guy painted our mail room, and the smell of the paint fumes filled up the entire accounting/human resources departments...and THEN as if THAT wasn't painful enough, at five when the warehouse shuts down, everyone flocks out the front door and of course leaves it open, and I guess a skunk had been hanging around outside and the smell got inside and so on top of the paint fumes I had to fight off skunk smell for 30 minutes. I was so dizzy and lightheaded when I left!!! Have I mentioned that I don't know what I would do without Deane? He's so incredibly supportive and good to me. This weekend in the midst of an almost mental breakdown, he sat with me and let me vent and then he just held me...he didn't try to *fix* things or make me feel like my feelings were invalid, or make me feel guilty for feeling some of the things I was feeling. I was just so depressed and sad all weekend and yesterday to. I don't know how he puts up with me, must be love huh? He's great though... I think my friend Angela has talked me into going to our holiday party at work...*sigh* I wasn't going to go and I wasn't even going to tell Deane about it and wasn't going to talk to my coworkers about it...I was just going to not show up! But today me and Angela were chatting via AOL Instant Messenger at work (Shhhh...not supposed to do that!) and she asked if I was going, so I told her no. And in about 15 minutes she had listed about 1,000 reasons for me to go and only one for me to stay home (the one reason for me to stay home was if I wanted to show my coworkers what a butt-head I really am LOL) So I guess I'm going...*sigh* Anyway--off I go!!! My feet are sooooo very cold! It was 42 when I got up this morning and right now it's 52...not cold compared to where I grew up...but definetly colder than it's been in South Cali for a long time! Me and my mom just finished chatting...(shhhh...she doesn't know I was writing here while I was chatting with her LOL)
back online... OK my computer was down for a few days and is up now...Deane is working on it still so I'll post more when I have some more time. Just wanted to check in and say Hello!!!
a laaazy saturday We didn't do ANYTHING TODAY! YAY!!! I really like it!!! Deane woke up with Hannah at 7 and I got up around 10...Hannah took a nap around 11 and then me and Deane fell asleep until 1:30!!! He woke up at 2:30 and now we're just sort of hanging out. Hannah's rash I think is finally starting to bug her. She's really warm because of it and I think that makes her really uncomfortable and irritable. She's very lovie though and yesterday we discoved that she gives kisses :-) Real sweet kisses. This morning she gave me a big hug and I thought she'd take off after she hugged me but she kept her arms around my neck and gave me a little baby kiss :-) Soooooo sweet!!! Anyway--we dont' have any plans tonight either...our cable is out so we've been watching a lot of movies...*sigh* Today seems to be urlLink Kevin Costner day here. He's probably one of my favorite actors...and today we watched urlLink Field Of Dreams and urlLink Thirteen Days . The first time we saw Thirteen Days was in the strangest movie theatre in Seattle and when they got to the line that said "The only city not in the range of these bombs would be Seattle." Everyone in the theatre cheered and clapped LOL....just funny. So yeah...we're not doing anything...which means I don't have much to say!!! The weather here has been cold (for Southern California) The low lastnight was 42! Right now it's 66 outside. We have the heat on for little Hannah's sake since her room gets sooooo cold at night thanks to the vaulted ceiling in there. Anyway--it's bad when I start talking weather, so I'm out of here!!!
leave it to my baby... ...to get the one disease we've never heard of. It's called urlLink Fifth Disease . We've never gotten into see a doctor so quickly. The nurse took one look at her sad little face and the rash and said "Let's get her into a room right now...in case....it's....contagious." Tooooo funny. She should be ok though and they said she could go back to daycare on Monday. Apparently she's not contagious after the rash breaks out...it's the incubation period that's contagious. So we'll see...she has another appt. with the doctor on Monday to get her shots and her physical...they wouldn't do it all for us today, they're making us come back. So Deane will take her. Other than that, I just hung out at home today with the Monkey! We had fun though. One nice thing about this rash is it doesn't make her sick or irritable and she doesn't fuss about it, so she's her regular funny little self, so we played a lot and watched movies until it was time to take the urlLink train (if you go to that webpage, we ride the Ventura County Line) into Glendale to meet Deane. She got to see horses in Chatsworth (Where urlLink Mister Ed supposedly lived...) and planes landing at urlLink Van Nuys Airport . On our way to the doctors, we drove past the place we used to live...Sherman Oaks...oooh good and bad memories...how interesting. Anyway, the whole time we lived there, the urlLink Sherman Oaks Galleria was under reconstruction, so I never got to spend any time there. Since we've been back though, we've eaten there at urlLink The Cheesecake Factory . several times...but I've still never wandered through the mall part...it's supposed to be really nice, so I decided tonight when we drove by it that I want to go there one of these upcoming days and just hang out there *smile* Anyway--we're both relieved that Hannah is ok and that the rash should be gone in a few days. There's no medication for it, and since it's not contagious, we don't really have to worry about it. I'm off to go relax now.
HA HA HA HA HA HA I AM A GEEEEEEEEEENIUS It only took me FOUR MONTHS, but I finally figured out where to go to change the background on my archives....they've been that dark gray color forever and I thought I could change it in my blog template, but it turns out there's a whole other template for my archives...this I did not know...BUT I DO NOW! HA HA HA HA HA I HAVE TRIUMPHED!!! WOOOOOOO HOOOOOO!!!
blogger grumps OK So I had two posts ready to go yesterday and lost both of them. Blogger is doing some maintenance, so I suggest to those that use them, to copy and paste your posts into notepad before you hit Post and Publish...it's not really blogger's fault, they say they're working out the bugs, but just in case they haven't fixed it by the time you post next, I'd be careful :-) Yes, thank you Jennie, Lynn, Q, and Kamie for the kind replies! I am feeling a lot better. Yesterday I was only a little better, but today I'm a lot better. I think part of my problem was that I felt like me and Deane didn't have time together anymore and that maybe we were going in different directions for awhile. The last two nights though, we've had some really good close time and have talked about a million things and gotten a lot of stuff out in the open...so today I feel much better. We actually stayed home again today, not because we're sick but because we were up until 4 a.m. talking (our alarms go off at 5 a.m. and 5:50a.m...Yikes) So we just stayed home again. It's nice having all this time together. I'm working on reconstructing my website. I decided that I'm going to use this blog as my "page" page...but I'm going to use my geocities account for stuff like the "100 things about me" page and pictures and stuff like that...so that I don't clutter this one up with stuff like that. Plus it'll keep it nice and simple! Maybe I'll work on that later today...I'm 1/2 way done with the 100 Things project...but it gets tough after awhile and I start just putting in dumb stuff and then erase it when I feel myself getting on the wrong track LOL...I also decided to un-join the web groups I'm part of...with exception to urlLink Online Wives and my urlLink Bloggers Group ...but all of my other web rings and such I've stepped out of...there's just too much demand and pressure on people in those groups, I couldn't keep up with it anymore!!! My brother's Christmas box got here! His wife and him got us some gifts and Hannah one too...we opened them and I got some really good smelling lotions and hand wash...they smell like Country Apple. Deane got a razor set...he likes it, but only really uses razors like this one on certain occasions...because he can't shave with it in the shower or something...but he likes it and will hopefully use it :-) Hannah as usual made out like a bank robber...she got a cool snail toy/book...it's so fun, I almost wanted to keep it for myself LOL...just kidding. She didn't even let me get it out of the package before she started screaming "MINE MINE MINE" and trying to grab it. She's been sucking on his nose all morning. Anyway--thanks again to those that replied! I like knowing I have people that will listen to me and understand the things I'm going through. I can tell Deane everything, and I do, but when I start telling him how homesick I am and how much I miss my family, I know even though he doesn't want too, he starts feeling bad about it and blaming himself, and that makes me feel worse since I don't want him to take it that way...Sigh...it's an ongoing battle :-) So it's good to know I have people out there with non-judgemental opinions. Anywho--I think Hannah just threw herself against the bedroom door, so I better go see what she's doing. Did I mention that she's learned how to take her clothes off? Oh yes. Her diaper too...this morning she was playing in her crib after she woke up, and when we went in to get her, she'd taken her PJ's off and her diaper and had managed to pee and poo in her crib...she did the same thing on Sunday...twice...in less than 72 hours...*sigh* babies.................OH and Deane's been having dreams about us where we have not only Hannah but a son too...hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... Happy New Years!!!
*sigh* Today was a lazy boring day. I thought I'd be okay with sitting on our butts all weekend not doing a single thing with our spare time...but it turns out I get a lot restless and hate sitting around. We did get over to the library today, 15 minutes before it closed, and got our library cards...didn't have time to look at any books though of course...so maybe we'll go back, if we're not to busy doing nothing. That's not fair. We do things...not the types of things I imagined I'd be doing when I was 12 and looking into my future...but the things we do are fun and family oriented...I'm trying very hard to be positive and happy about my life. I have a lot of things to be thankful for. We were up until 4:30 a.m. talking about why I'm so miserable and unhappy. I think I scared him when I said all I wanted to do was go home...I think he thought I meant I wanted to leave him and move home...what I meant was, that in order for me to feel like things really truly are getting better for us, two things need to happen...1, we have to have to have to have to have to HAVE TO get married and 2, I need to see my family more than once a year. I thought I'd feel better after telling him how I feel, but for some reason I came out of it feeling a bit worse. I don't know what to do anymore...I'm just tired of this exhausting feeling in my stomach. Maybe I'm just not being creative enough. I complained that our apartment is always messy, no matter how much we clean it, it's always a disaster...I feel so claustrophobic in here. When we first moved in, it felt big...and it's gradually getting smaller and smaller. UGH, I have to go. I hope everyone had a less-whiny weekend than me.
OK...it's OVER I got to work early on Thursday and took down all of the decorations me and Moe had put up. Why? BECAUSE CHRISTMAS IS OVER! Decorations get so cluttered and almost messy looking after awhile. I got so tired of it. After I took them down and cleaned up, I looked at it and it was so nice and neatly organized...I felt cleaner. I of course got a bunch of flack for taking them down so soon...but who cares? CHRISTMAS IS OVER!!! Get over it. See me in 12 months when I decorate for next year. Anyway--I do love Christmas though...we had a good Christmas. I already wrote about Christmas Eve, but Christmas day was fun. We slept in until 10:30 (Yikes, since we were due at his mom's house at noon) and opened our presents. Even Hannah opened hers...sort of. I started opening one for her and thought she'd like to do it herself since she normally loves ripping stuff...but she ripped it until she saw the toy inside and then just sat and tried to pull the toy out. I got a DVD, urlLink The Fast and the Furious , which I'd wanted...I keep explaining that it's because it's a good movie, but everybody seems to know that I just reeeeeeally have a thing for Vin Diesel. Wowzer. Anyway--*ahem* I also got a Conair Thermal Spa Bath Mat...(I'd go and find a link for it, but I dont' want to know how much it costs...) It's soooo nice :-) His sister-and-brother got me a new book to read...it's 204 Rosewood Lane by Debbie Macomber...it's the second book in a series...the first book, 16 Lighthouse Road, I read when it first came out. It's based in a town called Cedar Cove, Washington...which is actually Port Orchard Washington which is right across the bay from Seattle...so I really like it. Yesterday, or lastnight I guess...we went out to dinner at the Elephant Bar...it was so nice, then we went and played at Costco for a bit (I LOOOVE that store)...and today was a veeeeeeerrrrrry lazy day. We woke up and went to feed Otis, and then out to lunch at Tommy's....and then home again to watch Pinocchio...we ended up napping until 4:30 and then his friend Scott, who moved to Las Vegas last summer, came over and watched Groundhog Day with us and then we ordered BBQ from Reds...tooooo good. Now we're just hanging out, doing our own things. I'm about to go watch Pinocchio again, I fell asleep the first time we tried to watch it and plus, it was a bad copy of the DVD (my theory is NEVER RENT DVD'S!!!) Deane cleaned it though, so hopefully we'll get to watch it finally. The people we were house sitting for came home today, so we said goodbye to Otis! I called to make sure they got him and I talked to John...he's a true/blue New Yorker, born and raised. When I asked him how the trip was he said "I'm writing a book about it...I'm either going to call it "The Best F_____G Christmas Ever!" Or "An Epic Tale Of A Middle Class Family Christmas In New Jersey" TOOOOOO FUNNY... Goodnights!!!
Mmmmm Family... Even if it's not the family I was born into...spending time with family...a close family...or even two...is great on Christmas. Tonight we went over to Frank and Christy's and her family was all over there as well as Deane's brothers...we played a fun game... urlLink Balderdash . Fun game...we could've used that link to the rules a couple of times though LOL We didn't use the board or anything, we just split up into teams and played like that...funner that way. OH MAN...My mom sent ME (no, I'm NOT sharing!) some yummy-fied-delicious-scrumptious candy ... mmmmmmmmm...sooo good. Deane is in the living room being all sneaky wrapping my presents and so I high-jacked the candy and brought it in here with a diet coke and the movie urlLink Tommy Boy . I LOOOOVE this movie...this one and urlLink Black Sheep . Tooo funny. Tonight we went to Target to buy Hannah her presents...and they were CLOSED! I tell you ALL...I almost started crying. I felt like such a failure and felt like I was ruining Christmas for Hannah...ugh. That's a horrible gut-wrenching feeling...and yes, I realize she's not even old enough to know what's going on yet, but I know what's going on and I would feel so terribly opening my gifts and not having her have any...On our way down to the urlLink Elephant Bar to buy a Gift Certificate for someone (shhhh...I can't say who) we drove by K-Mart and they were open, so we went in and got her a bunch of Fisher Price stuff...we got her the urlLink FP Little People's Zoo , and the urlLink FP Little People's Cement Mixer ...yeah, I know, that sounds like a toy for little boys...but the driver of the mixer is a GIRL! SO THERE! We also got her the urlLink FP Chatterbox Phone . She loves grabbing our cordless phone and holding it up to her ear...so we got her this one. I can't remember who makes it though, and I can't find it on the FP website...so after she opens it tomorrow I'll have to put the link up :-) Deane is still being all sneaky in the living room. Hannah is in bed luckily...I'm glad we have a TV and a computer in here, or I'd be going crazy waiting for Deane to finish wrapping the prezzies...ugh. HURRY UP! I had the boy scouts wrap my presents for me at the mall the other day. I suck at wrapping gifts...so I was glad to see the booth :-) Anyway--Merry Christmas again everyone! I'm starting to get into the spirit of things little by little. It helps to be around his family, they are so very kind and make me feel at home...which I'm not...and that's sad...but atleast there's an up-side to it...and I'm finally starting to see it. Goodnight!!! ***tiptoes quietly out to the living room to see what Santa is doing***
MERRY CHRISTMAS! I don't have any time tonight to go to everyone's blogs to wish you all a merry Christmas, but I wanted to post quickly and say it! Merry Christmas! Stay warm, stay safe, stay happy!!!
A PUPPY! For a week anyway...a friend of mine is out of town for the Holidays (lucky her!) and we volunteered to watch their dog, Otis for them while they're away. Not in our apartment of course...but we go over to their house twice a day and feed him and play with him and love him...it's fun pretending for a few short moments that I have a dog. God only knows when/if I'll ever have one of my own...so playing with other people's dogs will just have to do. We did all of our Christmas shopping this last weekend. Pretty pathetic...waiting til' the last minute huh? Nah, we didn't think so! It was fun. I keep going back and forth on wanting to celebrate Christmas at all this year. It's hard for me to get in the spirit, when all I want to do is be with my family. I got Deane some nice presents I hope. I'm always afraid that he'll open them and pretend to like them when on the inside he's thinking "Ohhhh, how creative...you got me things you heard me talk about but didn't really care if I got...what I REALLY wanted was...." I KNOW he would NEVER EVER do something like that, but my crappy self-esteem just makes me feel like that. I feel really good about the presents I get him until I pay for them and then I walk out of the store and think "Uhhh...maybe he doesn't want this as much as I think he does." *sigh* Just another reason I'm so undecided about Christmas... My neice got a puppy for Christmas!!! She got a urlLink Rat Terrier and she named her Camille! The pictures they sent me are ohhhh so cute...just makes me want a puppy or a dog even more now. I've browsing urlLink Pet Finder and looking at all the little puppies and dogs up for adoption in the Los Angeles area and it totally breaks my heart...there are people out there who discard their dogs like they're nothing when there are people out there like ME and DEANE who would give our left arm for a little puppy or a dog!!! UGH! UNFAIR? YES! I've also been researching urlLink Portland, Oregon . Why? Because. I want to move there. I want to be closer to my family and my friends. I get the sad feeling though that Deane doesn't like the idea of ever leaving here again...*sigh* I'm just tired of having that sick-to-your-stomach feeling all the time from being so homesick. Atleast if we lived in Portland we could visit my family on the weekends and stuff. Oh, well. Life. Hmmm...what else? Not much. Oh! The apple cake I baked for the potluck at work last Friday went over really well. There were a ton of desserts there, but the people that tried the cake all really liked it and they ate about half of it. I'm quite proud of it :-) I also made that Chips-Ahoy! Pie and we've eaten part of it and I think the rest will have to be thrown out...not because it wasn't good, just because we haven't been home much to eat it, and it's been in the fridge since last Thursday! Last weekend was fun. Like I said, we did our Christmas shopping, but on Friday night we took his mom out to dinner at urlLink Red Robin . MMM It was soooo good. I used to eat there a lot in Seattle because the place I worked was right over one...and they gave us a discount...then on Saturday night we had dinner with his mom again, and his brother who's home from urlLink Creighton . He made a yummy Prime Rib...mmmm...soooo good!!! Anyway--tonight we went to the urlLink Northridge Mall to do some more last-minute-crowded-pushing-shoving-kicking Christmas Shopping for his mom and he snuck off to get me a gift...stinker!!! Wouldn't let me open the trunk afterwards either...I MAY have to open a can of whoop-ass on him later!!! Off to bed!!! Goodnight!!!
and again I say..."WHAT?" I don't know...maybe it's me...but I don't really like people that say one thing, and then two minutes later say something that completely contradicts what they just said...like this "I never get to see my husband anymore...he works soooo much we don't have any time together anymore!" Then goes on to talk about some other stuff and at the end of her email she says "Well, besides that, not much else is going on, just spending lots of time with my hubby and enjoying every second!" HELLO? Did you NOT just say you never get to spend time with him anymore? Make up your mind, either you want our pity or our envy, but don't go for both!!! UGH! Maybe that was mean...but that's how I feel! Anyway--tonight we went to Target, I had to get some stuff for work, Secret Santa stuff mostly...and some urlLink Toys For Tots . The presents had to be worth more than $5, so I found a bunch of toys on sale for exactly $5, so we picked out a toy for girls and a toy for boys...it was fun. Toys For Tots is definetly my favorite charity. We also got the ingredients for the Apple Cake I'm going to TRY and make tomorrow. I almost passed out when I went to look at cake pans...they're like 20 bucks...no thank you. So I cheated and bought the cheap-o tin ones...it's not like I'm going to turn into Betty Crocker and start baking everyday...so the $2 tin pans are just fine with me! As we were shopping at Albertson's though, I saw the same metal cake pans that were at Target for $20 for only $9 at Albertsons...oh well...tin ones are fine. We also bought a urlLink Jell-O Chips AHoy! pie. It looked really good so I got it and will probably put it together this weekend, since it doesn't require any cooking time. We didn't see the Oreo one, but Chips AHoy! is fine with us! YUM!!! Anyway--Hannah is all tucked into bed. She was soooo shleepy when we got home tonight, we had to run a bunch of errands after work, and she didn't sleep very much at daycare, so she is completely wiped out tonight!!! I've been reading up on bottle-weaning...our doctor said she should be completely off the bottle by 18 months...that gives us about 2 1/2 months to convince her that her bottle is not Superman and that yes, she can indeed live without it! So I've been reading up on it and hopefully in the next week or two, we'll be starting in on getting her off of it. I think the hardest part will be taking it away from her at night. We fell into the waaaay bad habit of giving her one at night when we lay her down, and now she can't go to bed without one *sigh* Hopefully it will be as easy as taking the pacifier away...with that, we just stopped giving it to her and she didn't even notice or be bothered by it...so ****positive thinking**** She's a good baby. Goodnight!!!
monday??? OK...am I the only one that hasn't done ANY Christmas shopping? Everyone at work is boasting about their Christmas shopping being aaaaall done and how they aren't going to be one of those last-minute-dash-out-of-the-house-on-Christmas-Eve-to-get-a-few-meager-gifts-at-Target shoppers. UHHHHH THAT'S ME! HELLO!?? Then the people that don't get gifts from me will get an online gift or something. Anyway-today was Monday...big deal. Just another day right? It rained and rained and rained and rained here in LA...so much so that it's flooding and stuff...what they don't realize is that it's not actually THAT much rain, we just haven't gotten this much in like 2 years...and the city won't clean out the drainage systems, so the leaves and gunk build up in them and then when it rains, the water has no where to go, and the "Southland" ends up looking like urlLink this . *sigh* I do love the rain though. Goodnight!!!
and on the seventh day... ....they rested....and it was ohhhhhhhh sooooooooooooo nice. This is the first Sunday in a long line of Sundays where we've done nothing. MMMM...yummy. Deane and Hannah are both napping and I'm watching the end of urlLink Mr. Hollands Opus . When it first came out me and two friends went to see it and didn't like it...we threw M's at the movie screen and stuck gum to the bottom of our chairs...we called it "Mr. Hollands Dopus" if I recall correctly. Then we went to the hospital to see my mom and my grandma and pulled our pants down in some thorny bushes to moon my mom and ended up falling over in them...hmmm...now that I'm much older and a little more mature (not toooooo much more mature though) I think I might be able to appreciate it a little more. I finished my book!!! It's the first new book I've read in foooorever! I love reading, and since I haven't had any money to buy new books, I've been recycling through all my old books that I've read a million times. Last time we were at Costco though, Deane told me he was going to buy urlLink Episode 2 , so I said--fine, I'm getting a new book then! So I got urlLink White Oleander . Gooood book, now I want to see the movie, even though I know it went be soo good. Anyway--Deane just hit me with a pillow so I have to go kick his butt.
heaaadache!!! OHHH YES, I've got a pounding headache! WOO HOO!!! It hurts!!! In response to my mom's tag earlier I must reply with...What baking??? LOL. The potluck at work isn't until next Friday, and I think I've decided to wait and bake the goodies for next week. For those of you that don't know what I mean, my mom sent me some yummy recipes for Apple Cake and Black Bottom Cupcakes. I highly doubt Deane's faith in Apple Cake...and as for Black Bottom Cupcakes...hmm...I don't think so on those either since they have cream cheese in them. *hmph* So I'll force them on my unsuspecting coworkers! Tonight we had a little bit of fun. We were in the drive-thru at urlLink Carl's Jr. and Deane said he hated making left turns...so I bet him $1 that he couldn't get home again without making atleast one left turn! So we went...and went...and went...we went down backstreets we didn't know existed...he turned around in driveways of homes we didn't know...and finally...eventually...got home...and amazingly enough, our food was still hot when we got home. So I owe him a dollar now. It was fun...I DID try to change the rules once I clued into the driveway swith-a-roos he was pulling...but I'll pay up. I'm not sure what our plans are for this weekend. It's supposed to rain all weekend! WOO HOO!!! I've been suffering from some sort of minor-fatigue I think this week. I've been really shaky and tingly all over...I wake up tired and want to sleep some more...stuff like that...I'm feeling a little better today, but still not 100%. The lady I work with has been out sick all week, so I've been doing double work at the front desk...which is ok, since I did that for a year and a half at my last job...but that was over a year ago, I think I forgot how tiring it gets. I liked it though, I don't mind working alone. I miss Moe though and hope she comes back on Monday...I like having someone to talk to and goof around with *smile* Anywho--I guess it's time to move along...goodnight!
yay! a visitor!!! I was asleep...I mean sooooound asleep...and Deane comes in from the balcony saying "Sarah, get up you have a visitor!!!" I'm totally confused and thinking he's joking with me to wake me up..."Wake up Sarah, you have a visitor!!!" So I sit up and just as I'm saying "Who?" There's a knock on our door! My friend Katie, that used to work at the same place I do came over to see me! It was sooo fun! I love having company! I went back to work today, which is a good thing since the lady I work with called in sick. I didn't do much work at all today, mostly just stared into space a lot. I still wasn't feeling too well and was a bit stressed out...the afternoon atleast went by quickly for me though. Deane stayed home today, so I had a lunch date with him and Hannah, we ate at urlLink Del Taco . One of our favorite places to eat. Anyway--not much else really. Like I said, did a lot of napping tonight. We had dinner at urlLink KFC . I found a listing for a urlLink Bob's Big Boy in our phone book, so we drove down there to the address listed in the phone book and it wasn't there! It was a urlLink COCO's !!! For crying out loud. So anyway...that was our exciting night, driving all over Simi Valley for the restaurant that wasn't there!!! Ugh, I just swallowed a piece of ice that was maybe a little too big...ugh. Have to go now :-)
Happy Birthday Annie Fannie!!! Tonight is my best friend Anne's birthday...I almost forgot about it *cringe* Anyway--I found out some upsetting news today! I know I told some of you about it when it happened in September, but I was supposed to have a friend of mine move in with us, she was going to take care of Hannah for us...well the day she was supposed to show up, she never came...and I still haven't heard from her. I heard through the grapevine she was back in Seattle...anyway...Today I found out through the same grapevine that she is talking to all my friends up there! HELLO...I still haven't heard from her! Does anyone see this as a problem? If you do something THAT huge to a friend isn't the decent thing to do is offer some sort of apology or even an explanation? Yeah...me too. Oh, well. I've asked my friends up there to please give me her phone number so I can call her. This is just ridiculous. Anywho--I stayed home sick today. At first it was just an upset stomach, but then I started getting all shivery and cold...and the heat was on and I was under the blankets, so I knew something was wrong...and then I got really hot and sweaty and couldn't sleep, and was all weak feeling and sick. UGH. I took some sudafed and it's finally starting to feel like a normal temperature in here to me. It's like 47 outside and I just went outside on the porch to cool down. UGH. Goodnight!!!
((SINGING LOUDLY))"there's no business......like SNOOOOOOOOW business..." Had ya thinkin' it snowed here huh? Yeah...right. I'm glad to see I'm not the only mint chocolate chip ice cream fan (Thanks Q! LOL) Yesterday we went to urlLink Sears Portrait Studio at the urlLink Northridge Mall . Very fun day. We were in and out of there in less than an hour, and we didn't have an appointment or anything...we thought we'd be stuck there all day waiting for a session. Hannah totally stole the show though, she was smiling all over the place and clapping her hands and everything. We picked out some great pictures of us all together and one of just me and Hannah. The Hawaiian Luau actually was fun too. Deane ended up wearing my grass skirt. I wasn't wearing it right or something because it didn't go all the way around my waist...after we left I realized that I just hadn't had it tied on tight enough. *sigh* it's ok...still a fun night. It took me awhile to figure out why they were theming the party "Hawaiian" and then when we got there they were watching Pearl Harbor and I realized that the date was December 7th...so it sort of clicked in. Kind of strange...celebrating Pearl Harbor Day on your birthday...but...eh...whatever. It was fun. We got them a 9 lb. Nestle Crunch Bar...it was the biggest hit at the party...Deane felt a little guilty that it totally overshadowed the other gifts, but I didn't care, I loved it!!! *smile* (Deane works for Nestle for those of you that don't know) Anyway--not sure what we are going to be up to today...I haven't been posting much...I've actually been..............BUSY! WOOHOO!!! Time to get goin I guess!!! Have a great Sunday...
there's nothing like mint ice cream on a coooold night! OK so I've been playing A LOT of urlLink Playstation the last couple of days...I have serious little sore thumbs now and my eyes are all bugged out and stuff...it's from not having cable...hopefully our cable will be fixed tomorrow so I can "just say no" to the playstation. Anyway--Hannah is in the tub playing and Deane is over-seeing it...I love quiet "Sarah" time. I wish we had more of it. Tonight we went into urlLink Wal-Mart . I hate that store and any store like it. UGH UGH UGH. Small cramped aisles, lousy rude people. Cashiers that don't know which end of a dog the food goes in...*sigh* This one though was remarkably different. So is the urlLink Target here in Simi Valley. Still the cramped aisles...but not messy and out of order like other ones I've been in. ANYWAY--the whole purpose was to tell you WHY we were there. We're skipping my company's holiday party to go to a Hawaiian themed birthday party for two of our friends. One of the reasons I thought we'd go to this party instead of my work one is because I wouldn't have to go out and buy a new outfit. We went out looking for Hawaiian stuff to wear to the party and ended up at urlLink Party America and spent...GET THIS...$44 on stuff...HELLO...I could've bought a new dress for the holiday party for that much money. UGH...no more themed parties for Sarah! Deane got a hibiscus shirt and a weird hat called a beachcomber. I just got a grass skirt and a leis. Oh Deane got a leis too...then we got them a card...for almost $50...*sigh* So let's see...I haven't been posting much, you'd think I have a ton to say...but I sadly don't. No new news on my friend Scott...the one that was in the car accident. So I guess I'll go! Hannah is done with her bath sounds like, so I'll go play with her. She lost her pants at daycare today *scratching my head* She went to daycare wearing a winnie the pooh outfit, complete with little pants...and when we went to pick her up she's standing in the middle of the room in these big baggy red shorts...toooo funny...our little "homey"...*chuckle* Nighties!!!
sad news *frown* I just got a letter from my best friend Anne...she told me a friend of ours from high school..someone I've known since Kindergarten actually...was in a bad car accident in Louisiana and doesn't remember anything. It's terrible! I hope he's ok. Apart from that, Hannah is still not sleeping at all during the nights...she's up right now in her crib being all fussy. I think I'm going to just let her cry...she needs to get back on a normal schedule. Anyway--time for bed!
wow...easier done than said! That was the easiest time I've had so far changing the colors...it must get easier the more I do it...and trust me, I've done it a lot...I just screwed up more times than I care to admit :-) Hannah is sooooooound asleep on the living room floor and Deane is out running around. He was only supposed to take the cans to the recycling place, but he's been gone too long for that, so I have a feeling he's over at his brother's house..........or at "Snooky's" (He'd know what that was LOL) I have health insurance now! YIPPEE!!! YAY!!! HOORAH FOR ME!!! I just have to remember who my doctor is and stuff like that...I need to have a check-up, I haven't been since I was in the hospital with Hannah...so I'm due...plus I need to go to the *cringe* *shiver* dentist *shiver* *cringe* I hate dentists. Ugh. Anyway--I have to go. I'm going to wake up Hannah so she won't wake up in the middle of the night..................again. She probably needs a bath too, she has cheese ravioli all over her little face and smells....like....a .... foot??? :-) Goodnight!
time for a change! Hi gang! OOOH so busy lately! Well...not really. But oh well. Things are getting better...I think I was just a bit homesick is all when I last posted. Being back at work is better than I thought it would be...I don't have as much time to ponder my current situation as much when I'm busy with work stuff. I'm going to be changing the colors of my blog as soon as I get a chance...hopefully tonight. I want them to be red and green...since I'm not into putting up backgrounds and graphics and stuff, I thought I would at least try and do the colors for Christmas...that should be fun...we all know how my past experiences with color changing this thing have gone *sigh* This weekend we are going to a Hawaiian themed birthday party at a friends house. Should be fun. We are going to try and find some hawaiian stuff this Friday so we won't look out of place not dressed up. I think Deane wanted me to wear a bikini, but that would only scare everyone out of their grass skirts, and we don't want that :-) Anyway--short post as I'm going to now try to do my colors :-)
wow...where did my weekend go? This stinks! My long weekend is over? Not fair! On another note...Hannah peed on me tonight...gotta love stuff like that. I do not want to go back to work. Ugh. On top of that I'm all depressed now. Today someone proposed to their girlfriend at Disneyland...she said yes of course and all of us cheered for them...but after I walked off I realized "Great...another couple that probably hasn't been together as long as me and Deane, and haven't been engaged as long either, but will end up married before we do." UGH...so I'm all pissy and grumpy tonight. So really I don't have much to say except that I don't want to go back to work and that's pissing me off and now I'm all grumpy about marriage and that's pissing me off...so hmph.
hmmm OK so today I was reading urlLink Jennies blog and she had a link to urlLink bookcrossing.com , it's an interesting site...I just can't bring myself to do it though...I hate giving my books away...I don't know if it's because I'm selfish, or because I like reading them more than once...but I can't even really get myself to loan books to people...weird huh? It's a neat concept though and I like the idea. Anywho--I'm feeling better tonight. My ear is still sore...Oh, yeah...I have what I think is an ear infection or something along those lines. The whole left side of my face was all pressurized and felt like a tire was resting on it, I could hardly hear out of it this morning and kept saying "WHAT?" to people on the phone and coworkers. Everytime I would say something, I could hear it in my head and then across the room in this echoey tinny voice...but yes...it is feeling a bit better...now I just sound like I'm in a barrel or something. Right now I'm watching Scrubs. They had a 40 minute episode of Friends tonight, which surprised me, I know they did it a few years ago though...I guess it's a time-filler since they haven't been able to find a successful show to fill the 9-9:30 slot in awhile...or the 8:30-9 slot... Tomorrow me and Deane have plans to have dinner at urlLink Mimi's Cafe in Thousand Oaks...I think Rachael is going to babysit for us, but we haven't gotten a call from her yet, so we'll see. Hopefully it's not too last minute for her and she can do it. If not, Hannah can go and have fun with us :-) Anywho--time to jam!!! Goodnight!!!
sooo shleepy Tonight after I made dinner, we watched School House Rocks...partly for Hannah, mostly because it's one of Deane's favorites LOL... Today though, man, I was so sleepy...still am. At work though, I'd be sitting there and then all of a sudden I'd start dozing off and since I sit at the receptionist desk, that's not such a good thing...I've been tired before, but not that tired...I tried everything from fresh air to caffeine...and nothing worked. So just now Deane told me as I was falling asleep on the couch that I could go to bed if I wanted...so here I am...ready to crawl under the blankets and sleepy. I'm thinking that maybe something is wrong with my thyroid...I think this because I have a lot of the symptoms...weight gain, exhaustion, dry skin...and some other things as well...so hopefully when I see the doctor on the 12th, she'll be able to help me figure out what's up with my body lately. Anyway--I'm so tired that it hurts to type, so I'm going to go to bed. Goodnight!!!
is blogger having problems??? Does anyone else have this problem lately? Sometimes like the last three posts I've posted will show up for a few days and then disappear...then re-appear, and then disappear...sometimes I have to go into my template and save it and then re-publish it...really strange...let me know if you know what I'm talking about and if it happens to you too???
holiday cards in January? Yeah, sad I know. But yes, we're sending out our holiday pictures tonight. No cards...I opened all the cards we had sealed and took the pictures out and put them into a new envelope with a letter I typed out tonight (my best friend is Microsoft Mail Merge LOL)...and put them together to mail out. We just had so many pictures and were so excited about mailing them out and then never did...because we were lazy really...so I sat down finally and just DID IT...they'll go out tomorrow, although I think I'm short three or four stamps...we actually had some .33 cent stamps and we put too much postage on some envelopes just to use up the old stamps we had...kind of crazy, but we don't really need 33 cent stamps that say "merry christmas" on them that have little reindeers on them either... Anywho--Hannah is having a really rough time with the going to bed without a bottle thing. We laid her down at 8:30, and it's 9:40 now and she's still crying and fussing. Poor thing...but we absolutely refuse to give her a bottle...no matter how tough it is. She needs to learn to drink out of a cup, like big kids :-) Awww poor thing...I'm gonna go see if I can help Deane settle her down. Take care!!!
subjects are so so so over-rated I hate coming up with a subject for each entry...but if I don't, then it looks plain and it feels like I'm not building anything up... ANYWAY-- Lastnight we went into the Valley to have dinner at Arby's and then decided that...well...we're here, might as well do something. So I told Deane to just drive around since the malls were closing...so he surprised me and took me to a Miniature Golf Course in Sherman Oaks...which is hilarious actually, because the course shares a parking lot with my old company...the place I worked when we lived in Sherman Oaks...the job I hated...the one I had that made me cry everyday when I would wake up and realize I had to get ready to go there. I hated working there, and being there lastnight brought back soooo many memories...not too many of them good. The golfing was fun though, and the bad feeling went away instantly. We had a blast. There was a group of dumb kids behind us though that kept running through our hole and standing practically on top of us while we'd try to play, they'd hit their ball so hard it would come down into the area where we were playing in front of them. At one point when they were running all of over the hole I was on I said "EXCUSE ME WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS DOING? GET OFF OUR HOLE!!!" They of course, didn't listen...but like two holes later I guess someone else complained and the security cops came and escorted their group off the course...it was nice. We had fun and afterwards Deane played in the batting cages and got to pretend he was A-Rod for about 5 minutes...it was fun watching him swing the bat...He had on a cute little helmet and everything. *giggle* That totally makes him sound like he's 8 years old...but oh well. Today we drove out to Glendora for a birthday party. We had a lot of fun. I think Hannah wants a dog now. They have a boxer named Rocky and as soon as we put Hannah down to go play, Rocky came running up to her and licked her from her chin up to her forehead...I thought it was DISGUSTING, but Hannah giggled so hard she almost fell over and then all day everytime she saw him, she'd put her face down so he could lick the top of her head...GROOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOO SSSSSS... IHCKY!!! Dog SLOBBER!!! hehehehehe After that we went to urlLink Fry's Electronics to look at digital cameras, since ours sucks and is broken after not even having it for a year. We were looking at them and then discovered the video camera's that take digital pictures too...for only like $100 more than the camera's...so I think that's what we're going to get with our tax return...and I think we found the one we want too...I just can't find a link to one online anywhere...hmmm...interesting!!! Hannah got tired of sitting around for us though and got fussy...we've also taken away her b-o-t-t-l-e-s as well, and she's so freaking stubborn that she refuses to drink milk out of a sippy cup...so she hasn't had hardly any milk today, just apple juice...so I think that was making her cranky...but hopefully in a few days she'll lighten up and STOP BEING SO MUCH LIKE HER DAD-----------STUUUUUUUUUUBBORN!!! heh heh heh OHHH I was going to write about the pranks I pulled yesterday...hmmm...ok...here's the first one... 1.) OK...yesterday morning one of the sales people came downstairs and was sorting of making fun of me because I don't drive...so I thought...OK FINE...you'll get yours. Right after he walked outside to take a break, one of his customers called...so I said "He's not in right now, but I'll be seeing him as he walks back in, he always stops by to tease me, so I can give him your message then if you'd like." And the guy said "HE MAKES FUN OF YOU?" and I said "Yes, all the time...we pick on eachother constantly." And he said "Oh, want me to help you mess with him?" And I SAID "OF COURSE--this is what you should do...he HATES the Oakland Raiders...total Raider hater...so when he calls you back, congratulate him on the Raiders making it to the Superbowl..." so he DID...I didn't think he'd do it, but I called the salesperson back like 20 minutes later and said "Did you call Ben back?" "Yes!" "Did he have anything to say to you?" "No!" "Are you sure?" "No, you suck, he told me everything!" And he hung up on me...lol lol...heh heh OK number 2... 2.) I work with a lady named Moe...her husband, John, calls once in awhile and if I answer the phone we kind of joke around and he's always messing with me. So yesterday morning he called and Moe was in the restroom so I said "No, I'm sorry, I cant' put you through to her, I have a note from her on my desk that says she doesn't want to talk to you." and he said "That's not funny, that's it...I'm reporting you." "Who are you going to report me to?" "MOE, I'm telling MOE on you!!!" so I said "OK fine, I'll just tell her on you too then we'll be even." So he hung up...which was hilarious...but not the best part. See, he's a New York Giants fan big-time...and they didn't make it to the play-offs by like one point...heh heh heh...so when he called back that afternoon, Moe just happened to be in a training class and I said "Sorry, she's not here, she's in a training class." and he said "no, you're lying like you were earlier, let me talk to her." I said "No, I am serious and I wanted to apologize for being such a crap-head to you earlier...it was uncalled for. I also wanted to let you know that I wish you the best of luck this weekend when the Giants play in the Super Bowl, I hope they pull it off...." LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG SILENCE...and then I said "OH, GOSH, OH MAN, I'm SOOO SORRY--they aren't IN the Super Bowl this year ARE THEY???" Heh heh heh LOL it was funny. That's when he informed me I was on his list...it was fun. OK Goodnighties!!!
FRIDAY!!! WOOOOOO HOO!!! Awww...time to relax. Any plans this weekend you ask? Hmmm...yes, actually. Tomorrow a friend of ours is having a birthday party for his son, who's turning 2. So we're going. It's at the same place that we went to the Halloween party at...it's a huge house with the coolest designed yard EVER. I loved it. Other than that, not much else planned I don't think. Bunch of semi-strange fairly-sad things happened this week. My friends grandpa died on Wednesday and she called work crying and stuff...today she called back and sounded better, but we were worried about her all week...it's so sad when something like that happens. I think she'll be fine though, she sounded pretty *positive* about it...if positive is the right word...I guess maybe saying "she sounds like she's come to terms with it" sounds more like it. Of course she's not going to positive about it, but she's atleast found a way to look at it so that it doesn't make her too depressed. THEN today another co-worker of mine got fired. Kind of a cooky-crazy day. I did get in some good practical jokes on a co-worker as well as my co-workers husband...who has since informed me that I'm on his "list"...I wasn't quite sure what the "list" was until I asked Moe and when she said "Why? How did you know about his list?" and I said "BECAUSE I'M ON IT!" and she gasped...and explained to me that the "list" means that if you're on it and he sees you walking down the street, he'll mow you down with his car LOL...***looking behind me*** It was a good joke though, and when I'm not so tired of typing, I'll tell you all about it...hehehehehehehehehe... Anywho--have a great weekend everybody!!!
dead animal? YUCK! OH OK...so today I'm at lunch sitting there eating a piece of chicken and thinking "wow, this is pretty good." THEN all of a sudden I realize "OH MY GOD...I'm eating CHICKEN...MEAT...ANIMAL...BIRD...OH MY GOD I'm going to throw up." It's weird. I'm in no way a vegetarian...I eat meat everyday...chicken, beef, steak...it doesn't matter...but ONCE IN AWHILE I'll be eating it, or preparing to cook it and I'll realize "Oh man, this is gross..." Anyway--I've probably grossed everyone out now. SOOOO ANYWAY--I went to work for a couple of hours yesterday...came home early on my lunch break...went back today though...I've decided that I dont' care. ***(This entry has been edited due to the fact I do not want certain people reading it and reporting back to the individual mentioned)*** on it. I mean...why should I? I don't care if she treats me like that, because that means I'm a better person and in the end when it all comes down on her head, I can't be blamed for a thing. We call her "Jack In The Box" after those little toys that you wind up and then they spring out of the box. It's pretty funny. Apart from that, nothing else much going on. I'm pretty upset that we haven't been to the gym this week, or anywhere really. I'm starting to feel like Gwyneth Paltrow's true character in Shallow Hal...you know, the big size 24 under pants??? Yeah, that's me. Tonight I gave Hannah her dinner...cheese ravioli. She reeeeeeeally wants to be a big kid and so I'm letting her feed herself more and more...and I thought "Hmmm Cheese Ravioli...good for picking up..." (That's what it says on the container) So I heated it up and put some on her little tray and she did sooo good eating it...then she apparently got full and thought it would be fun to mix it up a bit...some here...some there...mostly on the front of her white shirt...in the end, she looked like someone shot her in the stomach with a tomato sauce gun. SO I gave her a bath...and I ended up getting pretty wet. She splashed and splashed and splashed...when Deane came in he said (of course) "She NEVER does that to me!" As I'm sitting there with water dripping off of me. Anyway--I just copied and pasted that story into a chat window I'm having with my mom...so she'll probably read this entry and go "WHAT? I got the copy and paste routine? What's up with that?" So I'm gonna go :-) Goodnight!!!
mmmm Thai Food Yes...mmmm...yummy food. That's where we had dinner tonight, it's only about a block away, so on our way home from the grocery store we stopped and ordered take-out. I ordered their bbq chicken and Deane got his usual, teriyaki chicken...they are both soooo good. I really should avoid Thai Food though, it makes my stomach all messy and sore for like a whole day later. Ugh. I'm suffering from it right now. Then we had some yummy urlLink Haagen-Dazs ice cream...Deane of course had his yummy chocolate-chocolate chip and I had a limited edition flavor, vanilla ice cream with caramel swirls and fudge brownie chunks in it. Plus, seeing as how my honey works for the world's best Chocolate company, he brought me home their newest addition the urlLink Caramel Crunch Bar MMMMMMM sooooo fattening I could almost FEEL myself getting fatter. However, I'm serious about weight loss, and had to splurge one last time before I get into working out again...right? Right. My mom found a work-out gym for women only, it's called urlLink Curves For Women and it's fairly cheap (less than my current gym membership is) and I'm thinking of joining it when I get the money. That would be nice. It's 30 minutes, three nights a week...I think I could get into that, plus I might get to meet some new people in my area...and I wouldn't feel so alone in the over-weight world. It's too bad that my online friend urlLink Andrea lives in the Valley, otherwise when she gets home from her snowy holiday in Austria, we could probably be work-out buddies, since she's trying to lose weight too, but neither of us have cars and the train takes too long!!! Oh, well...I guess I have to work-out with strangers *smile* OH man my stomach is upset...this time though I don't think it's from Thai Food, I really haven't felt so great all day, since before my lunch at work. I didn't even eat lunch, I just sat in the break room and read urlLink People Magazine . My stomach must just really be screwed up or something, I don't know though :-( I didn't really eat anything yesterday either because of it. Oh, well...the less I eat, the less weight I gain huh? Right. Goodnight!!!
and then it was Sunday... Ahhhh...so relaxed!!! We didn't do anything today! We had been talking since Friday about going to urlLink Davids Bridal , but never got around to it. We've decided to go back to Nebraska in May for his brothers graduation. It's not only exciting for him because it's a family reunion for him, but it's also a reunion for me! All of my relatives are back there and I get to see them too!!! I'm soooo ooooo excited!!! I got an email from my aunt tonight and she sounds excited too. They haven't met Hannah yet, so that will be exciting. Anyway--I'm actually not feeling so so chatty tonight...just not much going on :-)
I'm never too sure... OK...the urlLink Mary-Kay party was fun...lots. I realized on Wednesday that lastnight was the first time in a year and a half that I've been out by myself, without Deane or Hannah there with me. It was a bit awkward at first, I wasn't sure what to do with my hands, I didn't have Deane to hug or Hannah's stroller to push, so I felt...naked :-) The lady that invited me, or my "consultant", is a co-worker of mine and she picked out the colors for us after we filled out a questionaire...she picked it out perfectly, all the colors she picked out for me, Moe and Rachael fit us so well and looked so natural on us that we were all so impressed!!! Fun! I've been thinking about this for a few weeks now...and I've toned down the "I hate myself" thought to just a "I don't like myself" way of thinking...but then I thought...you know, if you don't like yourself, do something about it...so I've made a list of all the things I hate..er...I mean, dis-like about myself, and then a list of ways that I can help change it. Here's my lists... Dislikes 1. The way I dress (I dress like a man) 2. I'm fat 3. My hair looks like a used floor mop 4. I can't afford to wear make-up 5. I'm fat How I can change it 1. Try not to be so self-conscience, dare to try more feminine things, after all, I AM a girl *smile* 2. Start going to the gym again (Last year when we were working out everyday, I lost 15 lbs.) 3. Get a haircut, a new style and maybe some highlights 4. Break down and buy the $300 set of make-up and skin care from Mary-Kay and then I wouldn't have to spend that much ever again, I just replace it as I run out. 5. Stop eating at In N Out Burger, go back to the gym, work out, and keep at it Anywho--We tried Hannah going to bed without a bottle tonight, and I'm sure the neighbors would agree with us that it's not working so well...she's howling and sobbing and being all dramatic about it. Maybe cold-turkey isn't the way to go...awww...but maybe it is...it's quiet in there now...hmmmm....OH CRIPES there she goes...OK I'm going...
cleaning... I doubt that I've ever cleaned quite so much in such a little amount of time...lastnight I did the living room and Hannah's room, and tonight I cleaned the kitchen after I made dinner...it started out that I was merely going to wash the dinner utensils because the casserole I made makes a huge mess...but then I thought...why not a clean a little more? Pretty soon I had the lysol out and the sponges and the stove was all sparkly and clean and then the counters started to look white again (OK They weren't toooo messy to begin with, but it looked bad) and now I'm resting...tomorrow I think I'll take the night off...oh, wait...the bedroom needs cleaned too...oh well... Thursday night I'm going to a Mary-Kay party...I think I went to one once a looong time ago with my best friend and my mom...but I don't know if that was a Mary-Kay party or just a mother-daughter-make-over-party...maybe both...anyway--a coworker of mine is wanting to do it full-time (shhhhh....) and so me and Moe are going over to her house to let her make us over and play around with make-up stuff...I think it would maybe be a good time to replace the make-up I have too...if it's not too expensive. We'll see, it would be nice to have a new set of make-up though, mine is looking pretty ragged. Hannah was a bit of a grouch-o tonight...she fussed all the way home from daycare, threw a tantrum when we got home, didn't calm down during her time-out and didn't eat hardly any dinner...so Deane bathed her and we put her right to bed at like 8:30...she's definetly an interesting baby when she gets mad. Her teacher told us today that the kids that don't get "finger foods" for lunch steal the kids lunches that DO get "finger foods" like sandwiches and crackers...I send her to school with urlLink Gerber Microwavable Meals . She likes those and it guarantees her a hot meal during the day...but apparently she'd rather eat a jelly sandwich...so tonight when I made her lunch I made her a little jelly sandwich, goldfish crackers and some bananas...I also packed the microwavable meal in case she decides mommy's sandwiches don't taste as good as the other kids' sandwiches do. Anyway--goodnight everyone! My arms are sooo sore from all the scrubbing I did tonight!!! Deane isn't feeling well either, so I think I'll go take care of him. We're lying in bed watching urlLink Oceans Eleven ...ok...so I WILL be lying in bed watching it in like 5 minutes... Goodnight!!!
monday? already? Wasn't yesterday Friday??? HUH? What happened to the weekend??? UGH UGH UGH!!! We had a fantastic weekend...Friday night hmm...gosh, I can't remember Friday night, but Saturday we lounged around and napped, then went and saw urlLink Two Weeks Notice and had dinner at urlLink BJ's . It was soooo nice, we were both talking about how relaxed it was, when usually our nights out alone seem kind of rushed and a little awkward...like we've forgotten how to be alone in public together lol. Yesterday we ended up down at Disneyland again...don't know how really, one minute we were coming up with things to do on Sunday, and the next minute we were in line for the entrance...we got home around 10:30 lastnight and went RIGHT TO BED we were sooooo sleepy!!! Then...it happened...Monday morning came...UGH and here we are... Tonight we went to Target to buy...*drum roll* DIAPERS! Then got Burger King for dinner because our kitchen was a mess and Deane didn't feel like making dinner, besides, we were STAAAAAARVING!!! When we got home we cleaned our living room, Hannah's room and the kitchen...engineers are coming on Thursday/Friday to inspect the units here in our complex and I don't want them to see how messy we get :-) *Fingers Crossed* That they don't turn us in for having two cats...*cringe* Ooops *shrug* Anyway--my legs are kind of twitchy tonight...I'm gonna go!!! Nighties!!!
hmmm...what to say? Ever been at a loss for words? I haven't been able to think of anything to write in here...I can't believe it's been since Monday...what a long week...it feels like it took years and years to get to Friday. UGH...It's always the week after New Year's that sucks big. I can't even remember what we did this week...I think at one point we went to the mall? I don't know. Deane found out today that they are building a mall here...in Simi Valley. Something we don't need...and that I don't even really think anybody wants. OH, well. I like the feel of Simi, it feels small and it feels quiet...I'm afraid that if they build a mall it won't feel like that anymore...I like the idea of having to drive more than 5 or 6 miles to get to the nearest mall, in a whole other town...I like that. Tomorrow we're not doing much I don't think...probably just cleaning up the place...then tomorrow night we're leaving Hannah with some friends and are going to go out to dinner together. I can't wait. He got off of work early today and came over to where I work and I took my 15 min. break and we went for a walk together around the building...we held hands and talked and everything...we didn't have to tell Hannah to stop grabbing stuff or worry about her eating stuff or crying or doing anything strange :-) Anyway, short entry...I'm just short of speechless...have a great weekend!!!
new foods...try them or no? OK so I'm into trying new foods...if it sounds good. So far in the last 4 months I've been introduced to Biscuits and Gravy, which is delicious...and today I tried Chicken and Dumplings...really good as well...Deane however...is a definete no on the new foods thing. I always ask...just in case, I mean, you never know when he might decide to try something and I'd feel bad for not asking...but he always says no. Anyway--we got another Christmas package today. From his Florida college days...I've never met this friend, but we talk on the phone a lot and I like him so much, he's so funny and a great guy. Anywho, he sent us The Producers on DVD...and some silly bumper stickers for a tourist attraction in South Carolina (I think it's sort of an inside joke between him and Deane from when they went on their road trip together...because I don't get it) so I think Deane is watching The Producers and I'm trying trying trying to find out where I can buy some Hansen's Dailies...they only seem to have it on the catering truck that comes to work everyday, which seems silly to me...but I'm going to write them a letter and find out where I can find some in the stores, as they are too expensive to buy everyday off the truck. I had my review today at work...it went ok...I'm meeting all standards. So that felt good. She thinks I have a lot of potential for growth there too, so that was exciting...I love sitting at the front desk, but eventually would like to move on to other projects. I like working there. OH and this morning I figured out my only source of unhappiness...are you ready for this??? GETTING OUT OF BED... Didn't see that coming didja? I dont' mind waking up...I'm ok with that part...it's actually getting up that sucks. Not just Monday-Friday...but 7 days a week I hate doing this...it's such a bother. Plus you're all cozy and warm snuggled under the blankets...why ruin it by getting up??? Huh? I don't get it. Everything should be accessible from bed. Just an idea... We decided to meet his friends at Chili's tonight...at 10:30. I guess they used to do this every Tuesday night, but then we had Hannah and couldn't stay out late, so we stopped going, but tonight we decided to take her out with us and see his friends. We haven't been to Chili's Night since last May or June...so it'll be good to see his friends again. Such a late night though... Anyway--I'm off to change out of my work clothes and spend time with Deane and Hannah...as soon as I got home I got online, so I should go spend time with them :-) Take care everyone!!!
saturday... OK So woohoo for me! This day was MUCH better than last Saturday...this day didn't make me want to die. Although yesterday I was so siiiiiick I thought I just might die. I went to bed at 7p.m. and slept all night until 9a.m...and still had a bit of a stomach ache when I woke up...I don't know what it was from. Luckily I am in a relationship with the world's greatest man and he took care of me and Hannah lastnight so I could rest and get better. I woke up briefly at 11 and he doted on me and made sure I had everything I needed before I went back to bed...whatta sweetie! I hope everyone had a good, safe, fun New Years. We did. It was nice. At the last minute we decided to go to Newport Beach...one of our favorite places. It was a quiet evening, we walked along the harbor and looked at all the million dollar homes for sale and made plans for when we bought one *smile* I would definetly never had a tree in my front window that looks out over the harbor...that's just crazy...nor would I have those small little windows either...I'd have a huuuuuuuuuge-mongous window in my living room...but that's just me! We left Newport Beach right after midnight and thought we'd see a bunch of cops pulling people over on the 5 Freeway, but the only ones we saw were right in Newport Beach and the 5 Freeway was completely open and there weren't any accidents or pull-over's anywhere...interesting. Although I heard of a bunch of bad bad accidents in Seattle where my parents live and over by Kettle Falls, where I grew up...but that's sort of expected...the roads up there in Kettle Falls are so icy and snowy and windy and that's always a bad combo, but on New Years it's almost asking for a bad wreck somewhere...still sad though...luckily this time it was nobody I know. Today we went to Eggs N Things for breakfast...it was soooo good. Normally when I go there, I get the denver omelette, but today I got the steak and cheese with mushroom omelette...it was sooo good...although, from being sick the last couple of days, my stomach has shrunk from me not eating anything, so I could only eat less than half of it...but it was still good...then we walked outside and realized what a delicious day it was and wanted to do something special...so we went to Disneyland. Sort of a last minute decision and we didn't get there until 4...but we had fun, it wasn't crowded so I didn't go Nazi on anyone and started freaking out on people for stopping in the middle of walkways or just being stupid in general. OOOH weird funny story...today on the freeway we were talking about a Seinfeld episode where Elaine is dating a guy that looooooooooves the song "Desperado" and she tries to switch him over to the song "Witchie Woman" OK...now we've never listened to this song together, nor have we ever talked about it, or talked about this episode...but as we're talking about it, Deane goes "OH my GOD...look at that license plate on that car over there!!!" So I glance over and it's "WICHI WM" Weird eh? Coincedence? Hmmm...Strange? YES...it made my fingers all tingly. Next weekend, some friends are going to watch Hannah for us so that we can use the gift certificate they got us at urlLink BJ's . We've never eaten there, but are really looking forward to it! Maybe we can see a movie too...I'd like to see urlLink Two Weeks Notice with Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant, someone at work said it was a good movie. Anywho--I'm off to bed. I came in here to make the bed, and ended up getting online, and Deane made the bed...so I feel a tab bit bad about that. Goodnight!!!
I'm so glad it's the weekend Man, this morning at like 10:30, I'm sitting at work thinking "GOOD MOTHER OF GOD, is Friday EVER going to end??? It has to be like 4 pm. right?" WRONG! Try only 10:30...not even late enough to take lunch...ugh. FINALLY 5:30 got there and I bolted out of there like a mad man. Tonight we went shopping at urlLink Costco ...we got Hannah an outfit there, it's really cute, we thought it was a t-shirt and shorts, but when we got to the check-out realized it was *gag* a skort...but we got it anyway because it's cute. Besides, we can always buy denim shorts to match it... My wrist has been bothering me a LOT today and yesterday. It's right at the joint, and if I move my wrist wrong or snap it or something, a sharp pain shoots right through my wrist and hurts to no end. I don't know why all my paragraphs are one-liners tonight...maybe I'm boring... Hmmm..............................................OH my new favorite Ice Cream... urlLink Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake Ice Cream oh boy, it's soooo damn good it should be a crime. Wow. It has chunks of chocolate cheesecake in it and oh...so good. Ugh. Me and my friend Moe were discussing crazy dumb things we did in High School, and it made me laugh...made me a bit homesick for the old days too...I have fun now, don't get me wrong...but it's on a more mature level...and I miss being an immature 17 year old with my two best friends...*sigh* I'm sure they both remember the night they had me cornered in Anne's kitchen and had John D. pin me down and my two choices were to either kiss John or eat cat food...I know that I did neither of the two and somehow managed to get up and hide behind the door of the refrigerator until they let up. Hmmm...then there was the night they came out to pick me up and we had a bag of Oregano and tried to convince my mom it was marijuana and that we had bought it from someone we met at the gas station and wanted her to get stoned with us...heh...she took a whiff of it and said "I don't know who you bought it from, or how much you paid for it, but you got ripped off, that's oregano..." LOL...really funny. I guess you had to be there...*ahem* Anyway--goodnighties!!!
ya ya... I don't even remember what I wanted to post about tonight...hmmm... I decided today at work that I would start planning Hannah's birthday party...I mean, not like planning planning...but coming up with ideas and stuff like that. So I was looking through the urlLink Oriental Trading Company's catalog and they had some cute party supplies and ideas...hmmm...I started an excel spreadsheet with game ideas and stuff. I'm really interested in the urlLink Smiley Face theme... The blood tests I have on Saturday are to see if my weight-gain has anything to do with my thyroid...I am terrified of needles though and am a little freaked out that this will be the second time in a month that I've been poked by needles...ugh. Other than that, I can't remember what I was planning on posting here...ugh. Deane and Hannah went over to Frank and Christy's house for dinner tonight. I wasn't feeling so well...so I skipped it. Anyway--goodnight!
blogger... I haven't been able to get into my blog or into blogger all weekend! I tried coming on to post Friday but it wouldnt' let me and then all weekend it was like that too!!! Work went fine...everything worked out. I had a pain in my chest all morning though and it was hard to breathe until I found out it was ok and that I wasn't being blamed. Anyway, last weekend was so great. We went to the tar pits and looked around the museum they have there, watched a little film on the history and stuff...afterwards we didn't really feel like driving home, so we drove through Beverly Hills and Santa Monica up to PCH and up the ocean to home. Sunday was relaxing. It was overcast and chilly all day, so we stayed home until late afternoon, then we took Hannah to the park and let her run around to get some steam out. We don't really have plans this weekend either. I have to have some blood-tests on Saturday morning, but after that I think our weekend is open. I'm not sure what I would like to do either. I talked to my best friend Jean Sunday night too! We hadn't talked in months and I called because I missed her!!! She promised to try and stay in touch more and so did I. I don't know what I'd do if we ever fell out of touch with eachother!!! She's planning on moving to Vancouver to live with a friend of ours from high school...I teased her and told her that they'd be dating soon after and she told me something interesting...SEE...in High School I had a crush on this guy, Ryan, and apparently he had a crush on me...but we didn't know about the other one liking the other...until after that crush thing was over and we had just become really good friends...but I guess our friends thought we'd been "messing around" together since they all knew we liked eachother. How embarrassing!!! Ugh!!! LOL Anyway--it's super cold here tonight...right now it's like 53, but it's been cold and rainy all day ... and my hands and feet are sooooooo cold...I have to go find socks to put on and maybe some sweats...goodnight!!!
wow, this week is going by faaaaaaast OK...I might get fired tomorrow...or atleast written up. I'm terrified...sick to my stomach...it hurts to breath. I finish a report today for my boss and when I saved it and then emailed it back to her, she opened it and all the data was gone. I realize this is not my fault and most people would say "that's not your fault...you saved it..." yeah, but you don't know her. UGH...I hate feeling like this. ANYWAY--yes, this week IS going by waaaay fast...although I was a bit disappointed when I realized this morning that it was only Thursday and not Friday. Deane and I decided that we are going to go to the urlLink La Brea Tar Pits ...(it's the place in the movie "My Girl 2" where the kid pretends to throw her ring in the tar? Yeah, that place)...I've never been there and Deane hasn't been there since he was little...so we're taking Hannah. I told him to invite his friend Melanie, whom I've never met, but he won't...so I have a feeling he may not want me to meet her...*smile* (I hope he reads this...I'll be in so much trouble LOL) EWWWW I'm watching CSI and they just found a dead guy in a cave or mine with bugs all over his gun shot wound...YUUUUUCK...earlier they pulled a stake out of someone's head and showed the hole it left...*gag* OOOH gotta go...Deane's here :-)
weekend...over? soooo soon? OK our weekend was sooooo excellent. We stayed urlLink here . And ate dinner urlLink here ...Saturday morning and Saturday afternoon we hung out in urlLink Newport Beach ...then on Sunday we came home. It was so nice and so relaxing. Hannah was sort of unsettled being away from home, and threw a few fits, but oh well. Life huh? I was so tired from the weekend that lastnight when I got home from work, I went right to bed and slept from 7:15 until my alarm went off this morning. Tonight Deane went to urlLink Chili's to meet up with some of his friends, and as soon as he left Hannah decided she wanted to go and has been crying and throwing a fit for 30 minutes...*sigh* I finally laid her down and am just letting her cry for a bit while I relax and catch my breath. It's really tiring me out, these fits she's throwing...but I think she's starting to settle down and get tired. I hope so. *Fingers crossed* I hope everyone else had good weekends!!! I've been reading a few blogs and it sounds like it!!! Goodnight!!!
no peekie peekie!!! I did SUCH a good job this morning...I could've totally blown Deane's surprise weekend for me by looking on the computer at the history files and stuff, but I BEHAVED and deleted all of them and didn't look at anything...so I still have nooo idea what we're doing or where we're going. He's excited about it though, and keeps giving me more hints than my usual "one a day." So far I know it's within a few hours driving distance from here...it's somewhere we've never been together...and where we're staying is 4 stars...plus we're staying Friday AND Saturday night and have dinner reservations on Sunday at 4 p.m. for somewhere...hmmm... He decided he'll tell me Friday morning instead of making me wait until we're on our way... Tomorrow night I'm going to go shopping at urlLink Target with Moe...I need to get some stuff for this weekends trip and then I think we'll go to urlLink Ross to see if I can find some new outfits since they're pretty inexpensive there. I'm sooo excited about this weekend. This morning I had a doctor's appt. and they did their usual exam and stuff and then I mentioned I'm worried about the weight gain I've experienced, so tomorrow after work I have to go to the lab and have some blood tests done to see if it's my thyroid...so me and Moe switched schedules, which means I'll be there at 7 a.m. so I can get off work at 4 before the lab closes and then be home when Moe gets off work and comes to get me. It's been raining non-stop since lastnight...so when I went to the doctors this morning and had to walk 3 blocks in the rain, I got pretty wet...not as wet as after the appt. when the wind was blowing and the rain was coming down in all different directions...plus I stepped in a puddle of water that went up to my ankle...needless to say, when I got to work, I was not a happy camper...ugh. I didn't have time to come home first though and change out of my wet shoes, so I had gross wet feet all day...that can't be good can it??? I didn't think so. Anyway--I should get going...Hannah is out in the living room with Deane and I can hear her screaming...which means she's been climbing on something and he told her no...ugh...here comes the tantrum...*sigh*
woo-hoo! Doctors appt! Tomorrow! Woo-Hoo!!! Gives me time to sleepy in :-) Plus I don't have to be at work until 1:30! WOO-HOO!!! I couldn't be more excited. Anyway...gosh, I just really don't have anything to say on this blog thing anymore...*sigh* Deane is up to no good :-) Actually, he's planning a secret for Valentine's Day...I'm excited...he was in here all sneaky-like earlier and told me not to go through any "history" or "temp files" on the computer...hehehehe... Hmmm...OH, Hannah is doing much better. Deane took her to the doctor yesterday because she was having a bad day at daycare...and the dr. looked at her and said she didn't have any infections or anything, but that maybe she had fluid in her ear from a cold she'd had...so he gave us some ear drops to put in there and see if that would work. It seems to be doing better. Tonight she went to bed at 9:30 and at 10:30 I heard her turn her light on and start banging her crib against the wall...so she's awake...and her and Deane are "stalking" me right now...I should go...they think they're sooooo clever...I'll show them!!!
wow...non-existent eh? Yes, I'm still alive!!! I can't believe I've been such a ghost around this place. This weekend was busy though, and we've been getting out and doing a lot lately, so I've been onto bigger and better things for the time being :-) My latest adventure is urlLink this . You have to be a member...so please...join :-) Friends and family are welcome. Anyway--it's late. I have a bunch to post, but I'll have to do it tomorrow...I'm so tired from working on the photo album, that I'll have to rest and start again tomorrow :-) goodnight!!!
imood Am I the only one that goes weeks in and weeks out without changing my imood??? heh heh heh...I just realized I was still "angry" from like a month ago when...awww, I can't remember even...anywho...just thought it was funny.
friends Have you ever had a friend that you've never met in person, only talked to on the phone a few times, and usually only just talk a few times every couple of weeks, or even months? Hmm? Like a pen pal? You trust this person with secrets, you trust this person with your deepest inner-most feelings...because, well...he's your friend right? Good. I'm glad I'm not the only one. Seven years ago, when I first started using the internet, I met my friend Todd online. He's from Texas, and that was my big thing in high school...Texas...loved it...so when he started chatting with me I was so excited LOL...his friend (at the time) was totally trying to get with my friend...and when that didn't happen, it was just me and Todd...chatting away :-) I think I had actually started chatting with Todd first, and one night his friend messaged me to bug me about Jean...but anyway...his friend has nothing to do with it. I dont' even know why I"m writing this. People that don't understand won't believe me. He's one of the nicest people I've ever met...or not met...or ... whatever. I found out he reads this blog once in awhile too ... so maybe this is just some shameless act of sucking up LOL :-))) heh heh heh This last week has been buuuuuuuuuuusy...or not so. I don't know. Between being sick and being sick of my job, I haven't had much time for anything. Oh, on Saturday though, we did spend 12 looooooooooooooooooong hours at Disneyland with his neice, Katie. Since we have annual passes, when we go there, we normally don't spend more than 4 or 5 hours there...since we can always come back later. But Katie only gets there like once a year, so we had to get in two or three rides on all the big rides before we could go home, and as tired and ragged as she was, she wanted to stay...*sigh* Monday I stayed home sick. Couldn't hear out my ears...thought I was dying...lol. Got a little pi$$ed off when the doctors office couldn't see me on such short notice. Whatever. I'm feeling better now though...lotsa sudafed and I feel soooo much better now. We went out to Target tonight and bought a new toilet seat lol...the old one was a cheap-o one our apartment manager put on before we moved in, it had plastic hinges and plastic screws and finally broke to pieces...so we replaced it with a metal hinged one, and I told Deane we were taking it with us when we move out LOL... Anywho--enough toilet talk. Goodnight everyone (Hi Todd ***WAVE***)
urlLink Wednesday Wish If you were not named what you are, what name would you wish to have? Do you think things would be different if you had that name? How? Hmmm...well over the years I've changed my mind on this a lot. I used to want to be a Mary-Anne...then I wanted to not necessarily change my name, but go by my first and middle name...Sarah-Jane instead of Sarah...(when I met Deane, I told Sarah-Jane was my name)...but over the last 4 or 5 years I've really liked the name "McKenna"...and think that I would change my name to that if I ever had to change it...It would change my life completely because if I'd had a different name 6 years ago though, I wouldn't have ever met Deane...he was looking for an old friend of his named "Sarah" and that's how he found me on ICQ...So yes, it would change my life quite a bit if I'd been born "McKenna" instead of Sarah. I don't think I would change my name though. I think about how much I like that name, but I like Sarah-Jane a LOT more. It's sort of a "family" name and I'm very proud of it...plus I think Sarah is a beautiful name *-) Tomorrow we leave for our trip! More like in a few hours we'll leave...ugh is there REALLY a 3:30 a.m.??? UGGGGGGH...it'll be worth it though. I was on the phone with my dad tonight and we were saying goodbye and he said "Goodnight Sarah, I'll see you tomorrow!" And I said "YEAH YOU WILL!" and he said "....WOW...it feels soooo good to say that." I haven't seen him since February of 2002...I REALLY miss him and really need a hug from him *sniffle* He has to work this weekend, but hopefully I'll get to spend some time with him. Goodnight!!! See you when I get back!!!
***BUGELS SOUNDING*** I don't know why...I just think it would be cool to have that playing everytime someone comes to my blog...the "Chaaaaaaaarge!" duh duhda dum da dum...or something like that. *ahem* This week is going to be soooooooooooooooo sloooooooooooooooooooooooow...I need to find entertaining ways to keep myself occupied...Today I think I may have actually dozed off at work for about 20 seconds...not good of course. Then I told someone that Thursday was my last day of work and he thought I meant I was quitting...so OF COURSE I had to roll with that and tell him that I hated living here and was moving back to Seattle...he couldn't believe it and kept asking me why I would do that, so finally Moe and I started laughing and couldn't keep torturing him any longer...too fun. I'm sure there will be more of that as the week drags by...I know it's mean, but I HAVE TO OCCUPY MY BRAIN WITH MORE THAN JUST THOUGHTS OF MY TRIP OR ELSE I'LL GO INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored Deane had a flat tire today...I discovered that we don't have flat-tire-fixing-tools of any kind, so he stayed home from work and is now waiting for his brother to come help him. Should be a long night...hmmm... Hannah said "Cookie" today...that's a new word. Plus she walks around waving and saying "HI" to everyone...even if it's for the 30th time in a row. She's pretty funny. SHE ALSO almost did a face-dive off of our couch...which is an on-going battle with me and her...she climbs up there, I explain to her it's a death-trap for someone with short legs, and put her back on the floor...she climbs back up and laughs and the routine starts over...*sigh* so tonight when I grabbed her centimeters before she hit her head, I said "NO MORE PLAYING ON THE COUCH AND THIS TIME I'M DEAD SERIOUS!!!" I think after I'm done writing in this thing, I'm going to upload some new pictures to our urlLink MSN Community . We have some good ones from the past couple weeks that I want to show you guys. I think I might also try to figure out how to decorate the welcome page...it'll kill me some time before Friday right??? OK HANNAH HAS THE MOUSE AND IS CLICKING STUFF...GOODNIGHT!!
sign this... Regardless of how you may feel about the war, or George Bush or anyone else involved...please sign urlLink this . Our troops need to know we support THEM...you don't have to support the war in order to support them. We all want them to come home safe. Thanks urlLink Kamie for the link!
off to the beach! Today we went to our favorite beach...I did a search for it on the internet thinking "Yeah RIGHT, you'll never find a link to it, it's too small of a beach..." but it looks like someone else loves it as much as we do...here is a link to a photographers website, I linked it directly to the pictures of urlLink Sycamore Cove ...totally beautiful. The photographs are at the bottom of the webpage...she has links to them...they're so awesome...I sent her an email telling her I liked her photo's and that I linked to her page :-) We were talking about it today and I think we might have found a .................. wedding location ...***LOUD BELLS CHIMING*****PEOPLE CLAPPING*****WHISTLES CAN BE HEARD IN BACKGROUND***...we just have to look into it a little more and figure out where we could have our reception that wouldn't cause our guests to drive to far to get there...since the beach is kind of far away from any place with good restaurants or reception locations...we'll see. We dont' even have a wedding date yet. We used our video camera today too! It's funny, we were watching the tape tonight and the footage of me two nights ago at the park didn't make me gag or puke or want to kill myself, but then today's footage had me totally doing all of those things...I actually said "Wow, I think I've gained 20 lbs. just since THURSDAY!" Of course I haven't, but that's what I looked like!!! Anywho-- Hannah is in the bath! That means it's almost time for her bedtime! WOO HOO!!! Her fever seems to be getting better. We didn't go to the candle party, and were a little hesitant to go to the beach, but figured that atleast if she had a fit at the beach, nobody would really notice, whereas if we were in someone's apartment with a bunch of adults and more kids, Hannah's fit would be heard to kingdom come...so we dragged her to the beach and she had fun. I think the fresh air really helped her. Last weekend it rained and so she didn't get out much, and I know she goes outside a lot at daycare, but I think it's different for her to go out and play with Mommy and Daddy...she likes it a lot when we take her out to the little play yard here at the complex, and she also likes to just walk around the trails leading through the complex... Anyway--I think I have little grains of sand all over me...Hannah was throwing it (of course) and the wind I'm sure was blowing it around, so I feel all itchy and should go wash up and change out of my beachy clothes...I need to wash the pants I wore today anyway, since they're about 2 sizes too big and I'm going to return them to the store tomorrow...LAST WEEK when I bought them, they fit fine, or so I thought...but now they fall down and in the video all you see is me hiking up my pants...how attractive...NOT...back to the store!!!! It'll be the first time in a long time I've bought pants that were too big...usually it's the other way around...hmmm...I doubt that means I'm losing weight...most likely just really bad at judging how a pair of pants fit in a dressing room... Goodnight...
***singing*** "IT'S FINALLY FRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDAY" ***singing*** WoW this was a looooooooooooooong week huh? Wow. *sigh of relief* I'm glad it's over. My mom was trying to get me to change our trip up there until after the war!!!??? I can't...it's next weekend or I won't be able to have time off until Thanksgiving *gasp*...my company is about to initiate a whole new software program and for the next two or three months we'll be in heavy training and stuff...so they've blacked out holiday and vacation time until it's over. I'm not afraid to fly anyway, and I dont' think Deane is either. Someone on the news made a very good point tonight "Terrorists try to find the weak spots in a country and then they attack it." Well...after 9/11, I'm sure the least weak part of us is our airline security...so I think we're safe enough. I'm watching urlLink "The Stranger Beside Me" , the Ted Bundy Story...I've read the book... urlLink Ann Rule is my favorite author and I've read almost all her books...she was actually good friends with Bundy before he began his murder spree...the book is excellent, but as usual, the movie isn't up to par and I'm only half interested in it. We're recording it though, just to have. That's one weird thing about me, I'm a very normal person, but I love true crime stories and reading about people like Bundy and urlLink Randy Woodfield ...also an Ann Rule topic... does that make me weird? I am just very interested in why they did the things they did, like what made them feel like brutally attacking and murdering women was a good type of revenge to the women in college that broke up with them...what's up with that anyway??? If I killed everybody that made me mad...nevermind...that's not constructive thought... We don't have any plans so far this weekend. I've been invited to a candle party tomorrow, but depending on how Hannah feels I'm not sure if we're going. She's been running hot and cold attitude wise, and our friends that invited us already have three kids, so I don't want to take Hannah over there, have her be in a rotten mood and then set off the other kids...so we'll see how she feels tomorrow afternoon when it gets time to get ready to go. I'd hate to not go, but I'm not going to subject other people to Hannah's nastiness... Anyway--Hannah's in bed now, so I'm gonna go spend time with Deane I think...if he'll let me.
h e l l o o o o o o o o . . . . . . . . . . . Guess what??? I'm AAAAAAALIVE!!! Just been sorta crazy-around here. Hannah is getting like a hundred new teeth all at the same time and has been extremely hard to get along with... I went to my first NHL game on Tuesday night...it was great. The urlLink Kings got beat pretty bad...but it was still fun, and I'm a bit of a fan now, although I don't think I can watch it on TV...I still have a hard time figuring out what's going on, and keeping track of the puk is tough (Although I mentioned that on Wednesday and said "But I kept track of the fights!" and someone was kind enough to point out, that the fights took place right over the puk...so I guess I knew where it was all along!!!) I went with my friend Moe, and about 15 co-workers...although my other coworkers didn't sit with us (we had better seats...mmmmmm) and afterwards one of our coworkers who's a hockey player in a local league, got to play on the ice at Staples Center (where the game was) It was pretty cool... Last weekend we went out and saw urlLink Adaptation ...in the rain LOL...it poured, we had thunder and lightening and all that good stuff!!! We had dinner at urlLink Red Robin , I wasn't very impressed with the chicken ensenada plate that I ordered...they're always trying "new" dishes, and I am a sucker for that and end up being disappointed... I need to remember to stick with my favorite...the Sour Cream Ranch Chicken burger...mmmmmm with bottomless fries...sooooooo good. Hannah stayed with our sitter, and on our way home in the storm, listening to the thunder, I kept thinking we'd come home and they'd be sitting in the middle of a power outage with no flashlight. They were all ok though when we got home. This week has just been hectic with Hannah and work and getting ready for our trip next week...I'm really getting restless and ready to go...plus on top of that, we just started our war with Iraq and that's been hard to think of nice things to write about with it all going on...I finally had to put in a movie to get away from all the news...I did the same thing with 9/11...I can only handle so much drama and depressing stuff. Anyway--gotta go, dinner is ready! MMMMMMM Chicken casserole!!!
video cameras...fantasy baseball... My friend Todd, who I previously mentioned...whom I love dearly...trash talked me all last season because I'm a Mariners fan and he's a *GAG* Rangers fan...so this year he invited me to join fantasy baseball, I've never played, but figured it would be a good way to get him back and whoop his butt at baseball...I just looked at our teams from the draft and that stinker Todd managed to get Edgar Martinez...ONLY MY FAVORITE PLAYER...I would kill to get him on my team...I guess I'll have to bake Todd cookies or something...hmmm... ANYWAY...two of my friends have told me they're going to come up and see me while I'm in Seattle...YAY!!! I can't wait. I hope more of them decide to show up... Today the video camera saga continued...we woke up this morning to check the status of our order with Costco and in nice big black letters it said CANCELLED ...hmmm why you ask? Because Bank of America saw that we'd made two other fairly large purchases that day, and I think Debit/Visa/Check cards through BofA have a $500 limit a day on them...so it rejected the sale and so Costco cancelled our order. NO PROBLEM THOUGH...we called Costco and they tracked down the video camera we tried to buy yesterday, only they didn't have it in stock...but today they found one at another Costco...in Los Feliz...so we said "PLEASE HOLD IT THERE FOR US WE'RE ON OUR WAY!!!" So we went and picked it up. urlLink This is the one we picked out...it's different from the one we tried buying yesterday, and it's much nicer...and no...we did not spend $1,000.00 on it...so put your tongue back in your mouth...there's no way we'd spend that much... After the camera thing got taken care of, we took Hannah to the urlLink zoo . We ended up buying a yearly membership there, just so we wouldn't have to stand in the hour-long ticket line...it's not bad though...and we like the zoo...it's a good alternative to Disneyland :-) I'm a little sore tonight though. The zoo is built on a hill...so we got plenty of exercise...on top of the exercises I do in the morning...my stomach muscles are mighty sore today. I've been searching the internet for fat-burning exercises that take less than 20 minutes a day that I can do before or after the gym...and I found urlLink this . I of course don't know if it will work or not, seeing as how I need to actually apply myself to doing it...but I've been doing good with the other little exercises, and I've cut out most of the junk food and soda that I used to eat...I can't cut all of it out though...but most of it is a good start right? Right. I got a letter from my doctor today saying that A) I don't have cancer and B) My blood tests all came back normal which means I dont' have a thyroid problem...which means my weight gain is completely my fault and I'm the only one that can do anything about it. I was sort of hoping for some weird hormonal problem or something...to take the easy way out...but whatever...guess I'll have to work for it huh?
wow... I don't think the new colors on my blog look as good as I thought they would when I pictured it in my head...it makes me feel like I just walked into a vomitorium or something...I'll have to look at my color guide and think of a new color scheme. Anyway--I was glad to hear people still check in on my blog even though I don't post as often (mostly because blogger's been strange lately...but that seems to be fixed...) We went into Costco tonight and bought a video camera, but when we went to pick it up, they didn't have any in stock, so we were refunded our money, which was better because it was more expensive than the one we wanted, and we ended up finding the same one for cheaper on their website...so that worked out really well, and saved us $100.00. urlLink This is the one we picked out. I finally told him "Look, I'm putting my foot down...we have to find a camera and stick to it...I can't handle the constant shopping and changing of our minds...let's just decide tonight..." He agreed...so we did...heh heh heh...funny how that works. I was talking to someone at work and she gave me a good exercise to do that would help shape up my stomach a bit, so I've been doing for the last two or three days (when Deane isn't looking...I think I'd be embarrassed to do it in front of him) and have started to doubt that it's working on my stomach as it should be, but earlier I was playing with Hannah on the floor and went to lay back on my back and felt the pull in my stomach muscles...so that must mean it's working! So we'll see how that works together with the exercise at the gym...but I'm sore...UGH...but that's a good thing...but UGH anyway...LOL Today we got Hannah's little bed. It wasn't a whole toddler "set" like we thought...it's just a bed and mattress, and we found out when we got it home that the mattress is the same size as her crib mattress...I thought so, when they first told us they had a bed for her...I knew that crib mattresses are usually designed to fit toddler beds as well, so you don't have to buy a new one after 3 years...but whatever. We set it up in her room and at first she was really upset about it...which is funny, because she's still sleeping in her crib for awhile...but just looking at the bed made her go into hysterics for awhile...tonight though when we got home from dinner, she ran into her bedroom and climbed up on the bed and laid down. I think what helped was after she ran from the bedroom to hide from the bed today, I made it up with some of her blankets and put stuffed animals on it for decoration...plus she'll have time to get used to it, since she's still going to be in her crib for atleast another year...so we'll see :-) I completely rearranged her room today and cleaned out the messy closet and got together a huge box of my clothes and Hannah's clothes that we don't wear anymore and are going to give away to Goodwill...someday :-) We were planning on going to a Whale Festival tomorrow...this whale season is supposed to be huge for migrating whales along the California Coast, so they're celebrating up by Point Mugu and Oxnard this weekend and next with a huge festival...and we were going to go and meet some of my co-workers there...but after all the stuff we did today, I think we're just going to stay home and relax. Deane drove down to Irvine to get the bed and I stayed home to get her room ready...plus after he got home we went shopping to try and find the camera...and out to dinner...so we've actually been busy busy busy all day...not to mention Hannah waking up about 2 hours earlier than she normally does on the weekends...thanks Hannah. She usually sleeps in until 9:00 or 9:30...but today she was up at 7:00 *eyes bulging* I couldn't believe it. I let Deane sleep in though until 10:30, but then his brother called and I made him get out of bed. Anyway--I'm off. My arms are sore from carrying Hannah today. I had to take a bunch of empty boxes out to the dumpsters, but can't leave Hannah here alone of course...so I made three trips...all with Hannah in one arm and boxes in the other...down the steps, over to the dumpster, back up the steps, back down the steps and back out to the dumpster. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE!!! :-)
tagboard Did urlLink Tagboard make it so that you can't change the color of your smilie's unless you upgrade to their rip-off $20 a year service??? HUH??? How cheap is that. I'll have to look into a new board now *frown!*
FINALLY! RAAARGH! I haven't been able to see any blogs from blogspot, including mine, and I've been trying to post, but it won't let me. UGH...so it looks like things are better today, hoping that it lets me actually post this entry. This week we bought our plane tickets to Seattle! YEE-HAW! I can't wait. We were going to go next weekend, but the prices were way to expensive, so we're going at the end of the month instead. So I'm getting worked up and all excited. Today we're going to Costco to get our video camera/digital camera...so we'll have it in time for our trip. Some more good news, we're going down to Irvine this afternoon to pick up a toddler set for Hannah. She's too little to sleep in it still, and we don't know what it looks like, but it'll be nice to have it...and it's free...and supposedly like new... Anyway-I need to start getting ready to go. Deane went to pick up his brother's truck that we're borrowing to transport the bed set...and he's getting us lunch on the way home...but I'm not dressed yet and my hair is still up in the towel after my shower...so gots to go!!!
another great saturday! My weekends get better and better. Today we woke up early and were out of the apartment before 10a.m ( a record I might add ) and went to have my tests done, then we got the car washed at Lenny Dykstra's Car Wash, if internet explorer wasn't being crappy tonight, I'd find a link...he was on the '87 New York Mets...and now he owns two car washes here in Simi Valley. When you walk into the lobby to wait for your car, he has this huge sports case with tons of autographed Baseball, Football and Hockey stuff in there...it was soooooo awesome...I coulnt' believe it. Then we had breakfast at Denny's and took Hannah to the park to wear her out... Then we came home and all took a loooong nap!!! Tonight we went out (without Hannah) to dinner at BJ's (again, if IE didn't suck, I'd give you a link)...and I made the mistake of ordering desert...ugh...I feel like my stomach is going to explode...blah. BUT...it was soooooo worth it. I got the "Pizookie" it's a huge deep dish cookie with a ton of Vanilla Ice Cream on top, I got half a chocolate chunk cookie and half peanut butter cookie...mmmmm...Deane had a hot fudge sundae that was bigger than his head. Anyway--I think Hannah is waking up. Rachael said that for about 20 minutes after we left, she stood over by the window with her hands on the window and her head lying on the sill crying...then she'd go over to the door and reach up and cry for us... *tear* It was sooo sad to hear that...but they did a good job of calming her down and getting her to eat dinner. Goodnight!!!
different? It's going to take a few days for me to get my links back up here...I got tired of my old lay-out and so I changed it around a little bit!!! And then I changed it back. I just get bored SOOO easily... I can't decide whether or not this lay-out is going to stay up or not...hmmm...we shall see. I'm feeling creative?
a what??? Yes...a door-handle-less Toyota Camry...That's what I said. We were driving home from a birthday party today, and I happened to glance over at this Camry on the freeway and it didn't have any door handles...what's up with that? Weird huh? Yeah...I agree. Lastnight was a lot of fun. We went out to dinner at urlLink Gordon Biersch and then afterwards we went...shopping? Yeah...SHOPPING. Weird thing to do on a date huh? If you don't have kids though, you just can't understand. It's so peaceful walking through a store and not worrying about having to say "Stop grabbing stuff...put that down...don't touch ANYTHING...Hannah if you don't stop we're going to go home." Or having them get bored in the store and start crying and throwing a fit. We were able to spend as long as we wanted in each store...it was nice. We ended up at urlLink IKEA and not intending to, we bought a new desk and a new leather office chair...it's sooooo nice having more room in our bedroom. We had a regular desk before with an add-on stand thing for our scanner and printer...but now we have a corner desk with a hutch and lots of roooooom for all of our stuff and more room in our bedroom... Oooh, I'm chatting with my friend Rashauns mom...she's like another mother to me...I miss them so much! She's going to call me...I'm going to end this now so I can gossip :-)
where have I been? I'm not sure where really. I come online everynight to check my pathetic email (I haven't gotten any emails in the last week except the CNN BREAKING NEWS alerts...ugh)...and I think that pretty much deflates my mood, so I just log off and don't even open IE to look at my blog... Easter was fun. We took Hannah to the LA Zoo in the morning for a little Easter Celebration...she got her face painted like a little bunny (although everyone in Deane's family thought she was a cat and I think even a mouse...what? IT'S EASTER! BUNNIES...WHISKERS...BIG WHITE EARS. LOL. I say this all in fun of course, I really like his family. She went into the petting zoo and met some goats and a little pony. We had the camera with us, but we forgot to take it into the petting zoo part, so no pictures of her planting a smooch-er-oo on the hooved ones...I'll have pictures soon though of the rest of the day. Plus pictures of her easter eggs she colored at daycare and the basket she colored too...She's cute. Everyone seems to be moving their blogs...or tearing them down...so I'll have to go through my list-o-links and clean it up a little bit. I'm hoping to get to that this weekend...maybe I'll move my blog too...I'll think about it. People seem unhappy with blogger...maybe I haven't been using it as much, but I'm fine with it...for now. This weekend we're going out! ALONE! NO KID!!! I love her to death, but I neeeeeed this night out...I piiiiiine away for days gone by where I don't get to be alone with Deane for more than 5 minutes, and that's usually before we fall asleep at night...our conversation at the end of the day is usually like this: Deane: "I love you honey, I hope you had a good day today...what did you do at work?" Sarah: "I love you too...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzz..." GREAT!!! WONDERFUL! So on Saturday I'm taking him to dinner at urlLink Gordon Biersch . Today is the 5 year anniversary of the day we first met in person (We knew eachother for a year before we met in person...and for those of you just joining the Sarah and Deane Story, we met on the internet...YES OPRAH I MET THE MAN I LOVE ON THE DEVIL-RAN INTERNET) He hasn't mentioned our anniversary...so I'm starting to tap my foot and give him the "I know something important and if you don't bring it up soon, I'm going to get out a big stick and whack you with it" look... What's with all of Suddam's urlLink right-hand men surrendering? Do you think they were all sitting around in bomb-infested Iraq, talking about how great Suddam is and how much they know he loves them and would never do anything without their approval and then one of them happened to notice that Suddam was gone and all that was left was his chair swiveling around empty? "Uh, guys? I think he ... left...now...what do we do???" Heh heh heh... Goodnight!!!
urlLink Wednesday Wish You're visited by the chore fairy who agrees to give you one wish for a chore you will never have to do again as long as you live. What chore do you wish to eliminate from your life (it will be automatically done for you!)? MMMM CLEANING MY LIVING ROOM!!! I HATE IT!!! It feelsl like I do it ALL THE TIME!!! Everytime I vacuum or clean up, Hannah is like right behind me with cheerio's or a graham cracker or worse, a sticky gross granola bar...and then I have to do it AAAAAAAALL over again. UGH...TAKE IT AWAY!!! :-D I'm looking forward to this weekend. This week has been hard at work. Slow and boring mostly. Nobody is calling, nobody is buying anything, nobody is doing anything. Which means it's slow and the days draaaaaaaag by...I resorted to DUSTING THE FRONT OFFICE today because I didn't have anything else to do. I'll be glad when things around that place pick-up...hmmm, it feels odd saying that...but I do wish it was busier...busy means Sarah has a job for another day...slow means chances of lay-offs loom in the distance. *eyes-closed-fingers-crossed-tapping-on-the-desk-chanting "Please pick up please pick up"-over-and-over!!!* Goodnight!
hmmm I don't talk about the war...and I don't talk about politics...but today I was in the lunch room at work, and was trying to kill 5 minutes before I had to go back to work and I'm standing there in the middle of this big empty lunch room watching the news. I was watching these Iraqi's dancing in the streets, clapping and praising America and the other countries involved in helping them get their well-deserved freedom. It was so amazing, because as I'm standing there, I realize...wow...you know...these people have NEVER been free...they don't know what it's like to be able to wake up every morning and make their *OWN* decisions. Three months ago if they had been dancing in the streets saying nice things about us, they'd have been dead. It's amazing. It gave me goose-bumps. It's just so hard for me to understand what it's like to not be free...to not be able to make the decisions I make everyday. I don't think I could cope. I would never want to be in that situation, but it makes me wonder what it was like...you know? I mean, to wake up one day and know you were under Husseins power and the next waking up to realize you were FREE...wow huh? Yeah. Anyway--sometimes things like that hit me and I have to write it down or it will just overwhelm my thought process for DAYS. I'm going to go look and see if Lynn has posted her urlLink Wednesday Wish question yet...*frown* Looks like she hasn't posted one since the 2nd...oh, well. I didn't do that one...so I'll do it for today's wish: The Wednesday Wish Week Five You receive in the mail an envelope containing two tickets. The tickets could be for anything (a show, concert, flight, etc). What do you wish the tickets to be for? OOOOH I would have it be two all-inclusive cruise-ship tickets to.................ALASKA!!! YEAH BABY!!! Here's the urlLink Cruise I would want...only NOT on Holland America, ugh...no way no Holland America...the stupid-crack-head-superficial-backstabbing-twofaced-loser-with-no-management-experience that I worked for for 5 horrible gut-wrenching-ulcer-causing months used to work for them...ugh...see what ONE person can do to an entire company's reputation? *gag* ANYWAY I'm sooo off track with this. That's what I would want. I've always wanted to go on an ALaskan Cruise and since Deane has made it clear he would too, only not for our honeymoon, I figure the only way I'll get to go in this lifetime would be if someone ELSE paid for it...or if it was free...or paid for by The Wednesday Wish Author (Just kidding Lynn!!!) Heh... Goodnight!
nope, not bored! ....just TIRED...freakin' tired. UGH. Anyway--I haven't been around much, mostly because my life is pretty so-so. Not boring, but I do pretty much the same thing everyday, and if I posted the same post everyday...come on now??? Even *I* wouldn't read this blog of mine. On Saturday we went to Santa Barbara! OOOH PRETTY!!! In the parking lot of Jack-in-the-Box the battery to our tired little car died (it's ONLY 5 years old...COME ON!!!) so we had to get that fixed before we could go, but that didn't dampen our spirits at ALL!!! The cold wind in Santa Barbara just about killed us good though. WOWEE... I saw this next blurb on urlLink Lynn's blog. It's called urlLink Tuesday This Or That and looked more interesting than posting about my day at work. Who is: 1. Sexier (female)...Pamela Anderson or Jennifer Garner? Ewwwww...neither one??? 2. Sexier (male)...Ben Affleck or Matt Damon? MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MAAAAATT DAMON *RARRR* (that was my attempt at a snarly sexy kind of growl) 3. The better piano player...Billy Joel or Elton John? Hmmmm...I like them both, but since I have probably listened to more of Billy Joel's stuff, I'd have to say Billy Joel 4. Funnier...David Letterman or Craig Kilborn? I don't think Craig Kilborn is on early enough over here for me to watch him that often. I'd have to say David Letterman, his urlLink Top Ten List is pretty funny. 5. The dumber cartoon cat...Stimpy (of *Ren Stimpy*) or Tom (of *Tom Jerry*)? STIMPY SUCKS!!! Tom RULES!!! 6. A better news anchor...Tom Brokaw or Dan Rather? Dan Rather. Again, I know I've watched Brokaw before, but I've tended to watch Rather more than him, so I think I turn in his favor. 7. A better TV chef...Emeril Lagasse or Jacques Pepin? Emeril of course! Who the Hell is Jacques Pepin??? Just kidding. I definetly prefer Emeril and would LOVE to eat at one of his restaurants...preferrably his New Orleans one since I've always wanted to see New Orleans ANYWAY!!! 8. The trashier talk show host...Maury Povich or Jerry Springer? I LOVE Maury, because some of his shows are atleast a *bit* believable and Maury *seems* to have a wee-bit more compassion than Jerry. I don't like Jerry at ALL...too ...uh...creepy??? 9. The worse fast food burger joint...McDonald's or Burger King? OOOOH...toughie, I like food items from both places...but since I've bitten into more frozen french fries from McDonalds than I have from Burger King, I'd have to pick McDonalds. 10. Thought-provoking question of the week: Only a handful of U.S. Presidents have been considered to be *great* Of the following two, which one do you consider to be greater...Franklin D. Roosevelt or Abraham Lincoln? Why? I think they were both great...and they are actually my two favorite presidents in our history. I like reading about them both. Lincoln played the key-role in stopping slavery and Roosevelt freed us from our depression...those are two of the things they did, there's more, but I like both and I think they were both excellent presidents. THANK YOU AND GOODNIGHT!!!

Home sweet home...or is it? We got home safe and sound. We landed on Sunday in beautiful sunny 86 degree weather. Seattle was nice too...we were so tired though, that mostly all we did was stay at home with my family and visit. It was sooo nice though. Wow. I couldn't believe how good it felt. I got a little upset Sunday when we left and didn't talk to Deane at all on the drive to the airport (like it's his fault or something???) So to make it up to him, I bought him a KILLER Seattle Mariner's hat...I can't find a picture of it for some reason...but it's really freakin' cool...take my word for it LOL This week has mostly just been a catch-up-on-sleep-get-used-to-working-again week. Plus baseball started...MMMMMMMMM BASEBALL...I must say though I'm a teeny bit upset with my urlLink team , which are the above mentioned Mariners. They lost to the OAKLAND A's...COME ON!!! I maybe could've handled it if they'd atleast tried...but they were lookin' like little leaguers...ugh. They finally won tonigth though. My prank of the week: I put little pieces of tape on the letters of Moe's keyboard ... and then put a piece of tape in the earpiece of her phone...She got to work today and was typing away...when the phone rang she couldnt get her hands off the keyboard, and finally she picked up the phone and went to pull it away from her ear...OK you get the picture...it was pretty funny...She's an Oakland A's fan...she really had it comin' to her. I took a bath tonight...mmmm...soothing. My mommy gave me soem bath beads for aromatherapy stuff...I didn't think they really worked until I actually tried them tonight. I feel so much better, much more relaxed. I don't feel that pinchy nerve feeling I get in my back either...mmmmmm nice. OK that's enough mmmmmmmmm'ing for one night. Goodnight!!!
urlLink urlLink I'm Homer, who are you? by urlLink Lexi urlLink urlLink what decade does your personality live in? quiz brought to you by urlLink lady interference, ltd I think Deane needs to take these quizzes...I think he'd be an "80's" guy...I'm not sure which Simpson's character he'd be though....hmmmm...I won't even guess...he'd read this and get all offended probably *smile*
mmmmmmm weekend I'm sooooooo glad to be done with this week!!! Me and Hannah are having a "gals night" tonight. Deane and his friend Craig are out at dinner, so me and Hannah had some fine cuisine, a little wine and we watched an opera. OK...so no. We had pizza, she drank apple juice, I had a diet 7-UP and we watched "Nature Babies" on tape. Now she's lounging on the couch watching "Nature Babies" again...I can only take so much "Nature Babies" LOL... Today I got my birfday present from my friend Moe-Z...she got me a urlLink Mariners bobble head with Mickey Mouse wearing an M's jersey. I LOOOOOOOVE IT! IT'S AWESOME...I'll have to take a picture of it next to the glass she got me...also a Mariners glass. I've decided which of the Mariner's I'm most in love with...mmmmmmmm urlLink Joel Piniero , urlLink Gil Meche , urlLink Ben Davis and everyone's favorite urlLink BRET BOONE ...*drool*. Although for some reason, they changed his team photo and he kind of looks like a dufus...oh, well. I know what he looks like and that's all that matters...*drool* Anyway *aheam* I should go. Hannah is being toooo quiet in the living room.
almost friday... Deep breath...in...out...in...out...OK better. MY GOODNESS...for a short week this one is reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally taking it's time!!! It feels like it should be Friday night instead of Thursday ...but nooo...one more crappy day to get through. It's not work that bothers me. I seem to do better at work, when I have my mind on other things...besides money and missing my family, and wanting to go to school, and getting my license (Yes, I don't drive) and all this other crap that I think about all the time. If I'm not busy, I'm obsessing over the things I should have. Instead of being greatful for what I do have, I'm obsessing over things I want...or things I think would make my life even better. Talk about coo-coo coo-coo huh? Ungreatful b***h. Whatever. Sunday is my birthday. Maybe that's why I'm so idgity...I don't want to get any older. How sad. I'm not even 25 yet and I already feel old. Anyway--tonight was ok. I didn't obsess or feel sorry or anything. Maybe I'm improving? I hope so. We went swimming when we got home, that was nice. I like being in the water, I just don't like my face getting wet or being ass-grabbed in the pool...probably due to two different occasions as a younger type person where I almost drowned (I'm sorry AGAIN mom) ... but Hannah had fun and so did Deane and I. The water was nice and warm, so our lips didn't turn blue as soon as we jumped in and Hannah is starting to relax in the water and she actually splashed around a bit, usually she just clings to us and her little lips chatter because she's cold. Tomorrow it's odds and ends laundry for Hannah and I and then packing. Why? Another trip you say? Where to you ask??? Hmmm...try this on for size... urlLink Sarah's Birthday Weekend . Fun? OH YEAH. I love San Diego and I've never been to Sea World, so it should be nice. We're going down with two friends, one of which has a birthday tomorrow (I think it's tomorrow)...so it's a trip for both of us...they have a son around Hannah's age too, so it should be a family-fun-filled weekend. We leave Saturday morning and come back Sunday. Awww...weekend getaway. So I guess things aren't so bad. I must start thinking positive...I must start thinking positive...I must start thinking positive...I must start thinking positive...I must start thinking positive... Maybe if I repeat that over and over *closing eyes tight...* I must start thinking positive...I must start thinking positive...I must start thinking positive...I must start thinking positive... Goodnight!!!
mmmm nice day Today was nice. The bad weather went away (It must've heard my threatening tone the other day)...so we went out to lunch and then over to his mom's for a BBQ (mmmm...steak) and then came home and went swimming. Poor little Hannah no likie the cold water!!! She acted like we beat her or something because when we finally got out of the water, she just put her head down on our shoulder and laid there like a limp french-fry. Poor thing. She lightened up though when we came home and she warmed up a bit and got ouf of her soggy urlLink Little Swimmers ...she's ok now. I'm looking forward to only 4 days of work this week. That will be refreshing. It's my second long weekend in a row, but I still dont' care. I don't want to go back, but if I have to, atleast I've only got 4 days instead of 5. I found out if I get that other job this week too. I interviewed again for it last week and was told I'd know by the end of this week either way. So hopefully it will be a yes...but if it's a no...than I'll be ok with that too. Atleast they considered me right? Right. Anyway--my skin feels all dry from swimming, so I'm gonna get out of here and go find some lotion and maybe a nice man to rub my feet. :-)
Yahoo SUCKS so here are the pictures that I couldn't link to earlier today. The third one is my favorite. She's so happy!
she makes me laugh... My daughter...my beautiful little daughter...my precious pearl...my sweet pea...our little princess...our monkey-toes...our Hannah banana...she makes me laugh. Because if I wasn't laughing, I'd be crazy...I'd be crying hysterically banging my head into walls and pulling my hair out. This is what she did to herself today...with lunch. I was feeding her chicken strips and french fries, left-over from our dinner at urlLink Red Robin lastnight. I gave her some ketchup, because I know how un-tasteful fries can be reheated...and within MINUTES...I kid you not...MINUTES...this is what she looked like... urlLink here , urlLink here , and urlLink here . (That last picture is my favorite) Funny. After I rinsed it out of her hair, off of her toes (YES, her TOES) and out of her ears...I came in the bedroom, shut the door and took a deep breath. It is quite funny actually...it would've been funnier though if the outfit she was wearing wasn't new. *sigh* Our trip to Nebraska was fun. We actually got home a week ago...but this last week was long and tiring and I didn't feel much like internetting at all. I kept up with a few blogs, but that was it. Oh, and Fantasy Baseball...one day I'm in the lead for the whole season, and the next I'm behind by almost 30 points! What the??? Anyway...atleast I'm holding onto 2nd place. Not a bad place to be really. Anyway--I'm thinking of going back to Nebraska for the 4th of July. WHY? Uh, because I bave family there, and I love the mid-west. NO, I'm not kidding. I really enjoyed it back there, and when I've been there in the past, I really liked it. Housing is soooo cheap too...man, I was amazed that you can get houses so cheap. Houses back there that sell for 96,000$ are houses you can't find here for less than 400,000$. Yikes. You can't even find a trailer on wheels with pinwheels and pink flamingo's in the yard for 96,000 here. The job market out here is better though, so that equals it out I guess. But still...man alive!!! It's been 90 freaking degrees here all last week...so we're thinking YAY! Memorial day weekend! 3 Days! We need bathing suits to we can hit the beach and hang out by the pool! SO we buy our suits...Friday morning we wake up and it's 58 and rainy out. WHAT THE??? It's been like that ALL weekend. Craptacular. Anyway--time to go!

new job? ... maybe I'm thinking of applying for a new job...within the same company. Different department, different supervisor...different from any other job I've ever done. Hmm...we'll see. Tonight we had a friend of Deane's over for dinner. He brought Hannah a cute little a, b, c book. It's an animal book and it's wooden and tied together with yarn, and it has little magnet pictures in there that you can remove...it's cute and she loooooooooved it. The sad thing is, that she can only play with a toy for like 10 minutes before she gets bored with it...and needs a break from it before she can play with it again. So I'm sure, to our friend, it looked like she was un-interested...but we know differently. I haven't seen her take to a toy like that in a long time. I finished my urlLink 100 Things lastnight. It took me like 2 months to put it together. Weird huh? I missed urlLink Friends tonight...anyone know what happened? We were watching urlLink Eddie Izzard instead. He's a crack-up. He's a british cross-dressing comedian...toooo funny. Anyway--I was going to do a meme today, probably the thursday-thumb-twiddler but I changed my mind. I'm too sleepy. Goodnight!
did I sleep through the alphabet? Check out how I spelled Wednesday in my last entry. DERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR...
strange... Have you ever had to say goodbye to a co-worker that you don't really know that well, never really had to work closely with and really have nothing in common with? But they're leaving the company, it's their last day and they're saying goodbye to everyone...including you. What do you say? Do you make something up? Fib? Pretend like them leaving is going to effect the rest of your existence??? No...of course not. You hug them politely, wish them luck in their endeavors and bid them farewell...and then they invite you to their going away party...WHAT??? Yeah. But I'm not going. I have plans. Too busy. It's a L-I-F-E. WOW, I'm on a MEAN kick lately. Sorry!!! OH OK...so this girl that I've known like my whole life...she's like a little sister to me. We grew up next door to eachother...she's 4 years younger than me. I love her to death. We moved away from eachother after I graduated...but we've kept in touch. She's been telling me for like the last 2 months that she's unhappy living with her mom and step-dad...ok. So she tells me she's going to join the Air Force. OK...she's been saying that she wants to join for like 3 years...but now she's 18 and can finally join. Great. I'm happy for her, she's super intelligent (I mean like Ivy League smart)...and a few weeks ago she says she can't take it at home anymore and until she can get into basic training, she's going to move in with one of her friends. OK. That was the last I heard from her, so I assumed she'd done just that. But tonight...her mom...who is like my 2nd mom...emails me and say not only did my friend run away from home (technically, she's 18...but still...) she ALSO got MARRIED. WHAT??? HELLO??? She told me about this guy she'd been dating, they'd only been dating for like...an hour...OK, more like 6 months...but still. They got married so that after basic training they can stay together. WHAT? He's joining the AF too...ugh. So now I'm upset. I love her and I love her mom...and I want to take both their sides. But I'm not going to do that. ESPECIALLY now that I know she was not completely honest with me! So I'm just there for her and for her mom. If she writes me, I'll be there for her. I'm neutral...I'm on the fence...I'm sitting in the middle seat...I'm everybody's friend. I'm their shoulder to lean on. And I don't mind. They're my second family. It still hurts though. I'm a bit sad tonight. OK time for the urlLink Wendesday Wish ...I'm glad it has to do with something positive. I could use that right about now. What one positive thing would you wish for your life right at this moment? I would wish for Hannah to stop crying and to finally go to sleep. No. Kidding. I would want someone to come up to me and say that they will help us pay for us to get married...that's pretty much the only thing stopping us. Not necessarily OTHER people's money...but just money in general. Donations being accepted *wink*
urlLink Daily Double 1. If you can meet any celeb in the world, who would it be? Hmmm...proooooobably hmmm...wow. I can't think. Probably one of the cast members of urlLink Friends ...I'm sure this will change, but right now I can't think of anyone else. Except maybe urlLink Lance Armstrong ...I think he's a real hero, overcoming everything he's overcome and still being one of the greatest athletes...SO YEAH, one of those guys...*smile* 2. You house is burning down...you have 2 minutes to grab 4 items. What 4 items are you going to take? I'm going to assume that this is material items...not anything like children, cats or fiance's...soooo my four items would be...my address book, a family portrait, my purse and a urlLink Boyds Bears and Friends bunny (Lefty....on the mound) that my mom gave me when I was playing softball. I'm real tired. We went to the zoo today and then came home and I cleaned our bedroom. I mean REALLY cleaned it. Vacuumed, laundry, cleaned under the bed...everything. Whew...tired. Hannah figured out how to open our sliding glass door (not the glass door actually...just the screen door...but still) I just walked out there and she's waving at me from the other side of the door, outside on our balcony!!! UGH! Her and our cat Ralph are quite a pair, always scheming up ways to get outside. Speaking of cats...today Hannah learned how to meow...if you ask her "Hannah, can you talk like Fiddy?" she says in this little tiny petite baby voice "eow!" (No M...just "eow") ... it's sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo freaking cute. I think she's outside again...have to go shut the glass door I guess...She even can unlock the screen part...ugh. Here we go.
urlLink Saturday Scruples Ooops...it's 1:02 a.m. on Sunday...I hope these still count for Saturday :-) Browsing in an "adult store" at lunch hour, you witness a colleague buying a large inflatable woman. Do you mention it to co-workers? OHHHHHHHH YES, you NEVER pass this up!!! Your eight-year-old is getting pushed around at school. Do you tell your child to "turn the other cheek"? No way...you stick up for yourself...you don't fight or push back...but you NEVER teach your children to allow themselves to be treated like that...NEVER. An armored car turns over across the freeway. People are stuffing their pockets. Do you join them? Hmmmm...Good question. Tougher than the other two. I would probably take the money and then out of guilt turn it in...it IS the right thing to do.
funny... Usually when I check my yahoo mail, I just choose to empty the bulk mail folder without looking at it...but sometimes I peek to see what kind of stuff I'm getting now...and it always makes me laugh when I get the ones for viagra and stuff...but tonight I had one that was titled "Increase your manhood Sarahpinkerman" Yeah...because I'm so manly right? Puh-lease. If you're going to spam people, DO IT RIGHT!!! *smile*
I HAVE WON...I BEAT THE BLOG!!! HAAAAAAAA!!! I fixed it!!! *bending over and sticking my tongue out* HA! *dances around and flails her arms wildly!!!* Anywho--*ahem* *straightens out her shirt* How can it be that I spent the whole day indoors, AND manage to not go absolutely crazy-out-of-my-mind psychotic??? Huh? It rained today, so no BBQ, no Zoo...no fun outdoors. But we stayed in...had urlLink Cinnabon for breakfast...chili dogs ala Sarah for lunch and then napped...when we woke up, we were going to order take-out for dinner from our favorite bbq place (to make up for no bbq at the park) but instead Deane's brother invited us over for lasagna...mmm...yum. He was alone tonight with his two daughters because his wife was out with friends, so we hung out over there for a few hours. Hannah, I swear, must think when it's time to come home "Man, back to the boring apartment with NO stairs to climp up and down and no hard-wood floors to throw stuff on and make loud noises with." *frown* OH WELL!!! TO BAD--it's bedtime ANYWAY!!! Stinker. Deane is playing a urlLink video game , I was playing it for awhile, but then got tired of it and came in to check email...then I noticed my blog wasn't frickin-frackin' working, so I worked on that, took down my graphics that I had up...and that fixed it. Now I'm chatting with my mom...and she told me about a urlLink movie , it's one thing right after another :-) A quick trip to the computer turned into almost a two hour sitting frenzy. Atleast talking to my mom is relaxing...fixing my blog almost drove me batty. But *sigh* alas, it's fixed now. So I can climb down off of the bridge and stop freaking out. I tracked down someone I went to High School with. I haven't emailed her...I never liked her, and we went to school together for 13 years...and all 13 years I couldn't stand her...I wouldn't go near her with a 10-foot pole...so why would I email her now? I just wanted to see if she had really done what she said she was going to do...and I hoped she hadn't, so I could say I TOLD YOU SO!!!...but she did...and now I have nothing mean to say about her. Oh, well. I guess I'm over it. Over what? She never did anything to me...she just ............ was...ugh. Anyway--I think we burned the cookies I was baking. I told him to take them out when the timer went off, but he didn't hear it go off...so I have to go fix them the best I can. Goodnight!!!
is anyone else having problems? I can't view my blog anymore :-( Just the tan color at the top with my page with my information about me in it...strange. Hmmm...
sooooooooooooooo thankful it's friday Every Friday when Deane picks me up from work, I get in the car and think "awww...thank GOD." Today was no different. Such a strange week. Busy...but strange. I can't really explain it. Today started out crappy and got reeeeeeeally crappy and then got better...that was par for the week though. I usually have one or two road blocks to pass through-out my week, but this was like road block after road block after road block. Like yesterday when that sales person got pissy with me...what was up with that anyway? Today he was super nice to me and very very polite. Weird. It's hard to believe that two weeks from now I'll be in Omaha. I think the last time I was back there was like 10 or 11 years ago...I'm excited. Not only is Deane's whole family meeting up there, but HOPEFULLY I'll get to see my mom's brother and his family. I don't think I've seen my cousin Ricky (sorry *ahem* RICK) since the last time I was back there!!! Wow huh? OH, one more thing happened today. A couple of weeks ago, Hannah's school took pictures of all the kids...you didn't have to buy them until you saw them...well...ok. Today there was a sign in her room that said the pictures were in. So we went out to look at them and see if we wanted to buy them, but hers weren't in there!!! Can you believe it? Everyone else's were in there. They thought maybe she wasn't there that day, but she was...I remember...it was April 15th...Tax Day...who could forget? Yes, she was there for pictures...no, her pictures weren't in with the rest *frown* Poor Hannah. It's raining! YAY! It started at like 4:15 today and hasn't stopped. It started out lightly and now it's so loud I can hear it on our roof...which is strange since we have sort of high ceilings *smile* I likies!!! Anyway--I'm watching urlLink Bubble Boy . It's a silly show about a boy who lives his whole life in a bubble...anyway...I have to go. Have great weekends!!!
feeling posty... I don't have anything to say really, just feel like posting something. Today at work a Salesperson got pissed off at me because I was doing my job correctly...he told me he didn't like my attitude and didn't appreciate the fact that I was telling him he had to do something a certain way because if he didn't, I would be the one to get in trouble...so screw him right? Right. I was the bigger person though and acted as professional as possible...I SQUEALED ON HIM!!! I told my supervisor what he said and did, and she went up and talked to him and within 10 minutes I had an apology *big smile* Mess with me and I'll tattle...heh heh...No seriously...I just get fed up with sales people treating us like 2 year olds, or like we're there *for* them...ugh. So I don't put up with it...and since I alone can't do anything to stop it, I tell my supervisor, and if there's one thing about her that I love, it's that she DOES stick up for us. Anyway--we had plans to see a friend of ours this weekend, we were going to have a BBQ at a park on Saturday or Sunday, but then found out we could possibly get 3 inches of rain *eyes wide* So we'll see what comes along. It'll be nice just to have a weekend....*sigh*
something funny... Updated Employee Policy For Most Companies... SICK DAYS We will no longer accept a Doctor's statement as proof of sickness. If you are able to go to the doctors, you are able to come to work. SURGERY Operations are now banned. As long as you are an employee here, you need all organs.

urlLink Wednesday Wish You have had a BAD day. You woke up late, no hot water for your shower, your hair dryer wouldn't work, traffic was awful on the way to work, you were late, a fellow colleague (whom you dislike and who dislikes you) then proceeds to inform your boss that you were late, you get yelled at (or chastised at least) for being late, and then comes lunch and you think things MUST get better. So off you go to the coffee shop to get yourself a coffee (or tea, or cappuchino, or coke, or whatever you like) and just as you're going out the door, someone comes barging in and spills your drink all over you. In the heat of the moment, what nasty end do you wish for their day? OK...this is good. I always have something nasty in my head to say to people like that...I just never say it. I would think I would wish for them to go home, have their driveway full of garbage because OF COURSE the garbage truck accidentally spilled it and didn't bother to pick it up...then, when they walk into their house, not only as their toilet overflowed, but their puppy has ripped their living room to shreds and their cat has pooed and peed all over their bedroom floor because they forgot to leave the door open and it got stuck in the bedroom with no litter box all day...then they check their mail and find a summons for jury duty, a bounced check notice from their bank and a letter stating that if they don't pay off their car payment, it will get re-po'd...awww...TOO BAD...NEXT TIME YOU BUMP INTO SOMEONE AND SPILL COFFEE ON THEM YOU SHOULD SAY SORRY... YOU JERK!!! heh heh heh...that was too much fun. Thanks Lynn!!!
urlLink My New Blog urlLink http://fryedkrispee.blogspot.com Please update your links accordingly...thank you.
ok So I should either update this regularly or stop it all together hmmm? Yeah. I've just been sort of sluggish towards computers lately. Probably because work is revolving around computers (Not only because I work for a computer company either thank you very much) because we're getting this new and improved software program to run our computers...and we're "going live" with it next Monday, so it's testing testing testing, training training training, learning learning learning, practice practice practice...on top of our other normal daily functions...so the last thing I feel like doing is coming home and sitting down at another computer. I'm sure Deane loves it when I'm on the computer, I'm always messing with the display settings, changing fonts and colors and stuff...it must drive him bonkers. I just went from "Lilac" to "Plum" LOL...mmmmm fun. I do it at work too, that was one of the first things I did when they installed my new software, I went in to the settings and figured out how to change the colors and stuff...my co-worker came up today and said "How did you get it to be a peach color instead of the blue color mine is?" MMMMM smartitude. And she's supposed to be training me on how to use it. Did I mention that when I was in San Diego for my birthday I got sunburned? Yes...I'm thinking of changing all my online names from "simivalleygirl" to "fryedkrispee"...whatcha think?
birthday My birthday was a success...apart from the fact that I'm another year older that is. We went to Seaworld as planned...stayed at a very nice hotel, since we were with another couple, we had adjoining rooms, and between our rooms was a "common" area...with a full kitchen, a living room and a balcony...it was very nice. Seaworld was definetely a success as well. It wasn't 90 degrees out, there weren't a million people, the shows were fun, no long lines to stand in...even the food was better than uh...Disneyland. Weird huh? Yeah. My week even got off to a good start. Today however, things went downhill. I got to work and was informed that we needed to start keeping track of every call we get on a tick-sheet. Great. Why would they make us do that? I'll tell you why, because one of our positions is going to "go away" soon I bet. Ugh. So I had this nervous "throw-uppy" feeling in my stomach all day. I can't afford to lose this job. I'm not only not financially stable enough to be unemployed, but I'm not very good at finding new jobs. Ugh. They scare me.
Okay I am only taking one of the two drugs given to me by the VA. The mood enhancer made it harder for me to sleep not better and I didn't like how it made me feel. The pain inhibitor though is working well. I still have a dull throb but no serious shoooting pain. Also fixed the bed sag which was of tremendous help to my situation. Back is still sore and stiff every morning but not intolerable. PRoper sleep is vital to one's health. The bed can make or break that. No nightmares anymore either. They have subsided foir now. --Shaun
Well the VA Hospital at American Lake in Tacoma WA has begun to help me. I am now on two different drugs. One for pain and the other is a mild anti-depressent to help me sleep. So far it seems to be working. I actually awoke feeling refreshed this morning. There are side effects of course but I so desperately needed a good night's sleep. I am actually feeling like myself. The pain medication works a little differently than others. It blocks the production of enzymes that stimulate the nerves. The idea being to reduce the over stimulation and return it to normal. My back is still sore but I don't have the joint pain this morning. As far as fibromyalgia goes, I am showing all the symptoms and the drugs are the beginning stages of getting it under control. Dietary changes now include eating breakfast every morning and taking a high potentcy mega-vitamin everyday. Since my potassium requirements are above average banannas are the order of the day as well. Well as the weekend is the real test to see if long term help is happening I will keep things posted here. --Shaun
I toss, turn, I am up and down so much I'm keeping my Susan up at night. She is becoming irritable because of it. My problems with sleeping are making her a wreck. I need to do something soon as it will affect our relationship soon. Going to the VA hospital today on urgent care call and seeing if something can be done about it. Right now the pain is making it to uncomfortable for me to sleep right and that just isn't good. --Shaun
When you realize a few things in this world, then things become so much clearer. I definitely believe in God and if you say I believe in a fairy tale then I'll just ignore you. I I know there is a god. The proof is there if you really look. Evolution is simply not a real possibility. Anyway I am stronger than I know and despite my pain I give myself in God's hands and let him guide me. My life has been tremulous but with good reason. The disease I have is not to deter me but to motivate me. If you can't understand that I'm sorry but I know what I mean and in the end that is all that matters. --Shaun
Well it took almost 13 years but the US Government and the The Veterans Administratioln are finally admitting the seriousness of the Gulf War Syndrome. Since the late 80's and early 90's many a service man was popping up with severe medical problems. I am one of them. Now I come to discover I may (and most likely do) have a condition call fibromaialgia (SP). Though the condition is rare in men under normal conditions apparently many a service member who was in the Arabian Gulf is coming up with it. I already know someone else with this condition and have learned a few things already but I do know some things she doesn't. One the best way to deal with the condition is to remain as active as possible. It is a mind over matter situation. The pain is phenonminal but if you let it keep you bed ridden then it will get worse. Drugs just aren't the answer as they also tend to be addictive and mind altering. Thanks but not gonna happen. So simple low or no impact aerobics and a active life style are the preffered methods of dealing with it and the VA is already working on my case. I hope others who have been in the Arabian Gulf also seek help and quickly. At least I know why I have been feeling the pain I have. I will be getting a disability rating as well. Finally some real answers. --Shaun
Well here I am starting a BLOG. Why? Well maybe I'm tired of reading untruths, lies, manipulations and dealing with people who can't see just how black and white some things are anymore. I'm no where near perfect but I do know right from wrong and I do see the failings of our society as a great many things are happening. I am not politically correct and nor will I be. If you don't like what I have to say then don't read it. Otherwise read by all means but if you want criticize me then you'll be wasting your time because I just don't care anymore. --Shaun

Alguna vez se han kedado solos en su casa y prenden la tele y no hay nada bueno, entonces que hacen?: a) Van a comprar algo de comer a la esquina. b) Se ponen a hacer la tarea en un viernes cuando no hay clases sino hasta el lunes. c)Buscan algo para destrozar. Si eligieron la "a" pues adelante vayan y compren estaran de regreso en 10 minutoas a lo mucho y comeran por 5 minutos pues no hay nada ke hacer y despues ke?... Si eligen la "b" puede ke sean muy dedicados al estudio, asi como nacho...no hablando ya en serio esto es lo ke Karina haría... pero no creo ke nadie mas lo haga... La unica factible es la respuesta "c", algunos pensarán que les dira su mami cuando vuelva, pues lo mejhor que pueden hacer es buscar algo para destruir o algo con lo que destruir. Existen varias cosas con este proposito...como...mmmmm.....un encendedor y un spray...o.....crema para las manos, alcohol y un cerillo...o muchas cosas más pero algo ke no muchos piensas hacera es tomar una maquinita, esas de las peluquerias (o esteticas no se cual sea su preferencia, y si..............los estoy albureadno) y pues busquen a su mascota...claro no pueden rapar a una tortuga o una vibora, porfavor...

urlLink An alpaca who knows some tricks to get attention... urlLink
Grabbing some Rays If you notice your healthy Alpaca laying dead still, on his back, all four feet in the air, don’t panic. He may just be sunbathing. They do this often, especially in warm weather when a cool breeze on the belly would feel nice for anyone. On some occasions your Alpaca will be so lost in his own little world that you can walk right up to him before he will jump to his feet and run away. Bouncing You will occasionally see your Alpacas bouncing around the paddock, lifting all 4 feet off the ground at once with their tails held high. This is called "stotting". Cria's in particular enjoy to stott and chase each other around, but adults will also join in the fun. This activity mostly happens at dusk and is very enjoyable to watch. The Sulk When alpaca's get upset they will "drop their lip". The bottom lip will become all droopy and fall away exposing the bottom teeth and gums. Some alpacas will take pieces of hay, grass or leaves into their mouths and just hold it there for extra effect. Saliva will sometimes drip from the bottom lip as well. If all this sounds rather pathetic, it is. They are sulking. Don't worry about it. They have probably just come off second best in a disagreement with another Alpaca and they will get over it in a few minutes. (Often the sulking Alpaca will have a few globs of green spit on their face as evidence of the disagreement!) Dust Baths Alpacas love to roll and they will line up and wait for their turn. There will be spots in the paddock which become bare patches over time. And yes, if it's been raining, those bare patches will be mud baths - they roll anyway! It's Mine! All of it! Alpacas don't like sharing their food, so some of them will sit on the hay to stop the others from getting it. If a handful of tasty food has already been offered to an alpaca, it becomes second hand and no one else will want it. Sticky Beaks If you are doing some planting, fixing a fence or just messing about, it won't be too long before you have an audience. Alpacas like to know what's going on and more often than not they will all be there lined up along the fence checking out your handi-work. Likewise if you leave an item in the paddock when you're finished, a tool or piece of clothing, each alpaca will ensure the item is thoroughly looked over, sniffed and tasted before being delegated to their "boring items" list. They will revisit the item every now and again. Water Babies Alpacas like to keep cool when it's hot. They will dance in a sprinkler or dunk their feet in a water trough. If the water trough is big enough or if you have a dam - they will sit in it. Hum! Alpacas have a unique language. When they are moderately concerned about something they hum. Alpaca Mum's hum to their cria's. An Alpaca who sees or senses danger will sound the "alarm call" which is a high pitched squeal which sounds like a cross between a bird and a donkey! It is impossible to ignore. Male alpacas "orgle" at females - They blow their cheeks out and sound like they're gargling. Hit and Miss Alpaca cria's like to play rough and will test their mums to the limit. A favourite game is to be far away from mum, turn and run straight at her at top speed. The mum's nice soft fleece means a easy landing at the end for the cria. The mums tolerate this game quite well. A cria who chooses the wrong mum, though, will receive a face full of bright green spit for his trouble. Super sleuths Grown alpacas like to play detective and sneak behind you. You know they are doing this because you can hear them, but if you turn suddenly, every alpaca will be head down grazing or looking off in another direction just so you won't know they were following you. Males check out the dung piles to see if the females are pregnant. He will put his nose right into the pile, inhale deeply, roll his eyes back and then throw his head straight into the air arching his neck over his back. He will do this several times, snort and then either go for the girls or carry on grazing (depending on his analysis)this is very cientific. They're usually right too!

Today I'm gonna speak in spanish in honor of some of my real friends...(for all who don't undersatnd english, just that i don't wanna thell them the true)... Bueno para empezar hablaré sobre futbol... No cesan las sorpresas en la Eurocopa.Parece que este no es el año de los grandes equipos de talla internacional pues en la eurocopa no les ha ido muy bien, claro excepto por holanda que hay va... Francia perdió, merecidamente por su mal juego pienso yo, ante Grecia... Alineaciones: FRANCIA: Fabien Barthez; Bixente Lizarazu, William Gallas, Lilian Thuram, Mikael Silvester, Zinedine Zidane, Claude Makelele, Olivier Dacourt (Louis Saha, 72), Robert Pires (Jerome Rothen, 79), David Trezeguet (Sylvain Wiltord, 72), Thierry Henry. GRECIA: Antonios Nikopolidis; Takis Fyssas, Traianos Dellas, Mihalis Kapsis, Giourkas Setairidis, Angelos Basinas, Theodore Zagoraikis, Themistoklis Nikolaidis (Vasilios Lakis, 60), Costas Katsouranis, Giorgos Karagounis, Angelos Charisteas. Un gol griego dejó a la leyenda francesa fuera de la eurocopa... Alemania, Francia, Inglaterra, España, todos estos nombres son muy conocidos en la gama de selecciones nacionales que siempre estan en un alto nivel y dispuestas a "dejar la vida en la cancha" o "jugarsela", o como diría el perro bermudez: "echar toda la carne al asador".... Cuando oigo las transmiciones por Espn,como diría mi ma "espín",o fox sports veo ke los comentarios son totalmente diferentes a los de méxico, claro son diferentes personas...En alguna llegada ellos dicen muy tranquilos... "Raul con el balón,...da para casillas...casillas devuelve para raul....raul con Zidane(ke ni alcaso porke hablo de la española pero bueno... imaginemos ke es el real madrid)zidane avanza esta perfilado y.....gol gol gol gooooooooooooooooool...." Pero en México esto sería muy diferente algo asi.... " La lleva matador...matador con el balon se la pasa a ramoncito.. ramoncito toca de taquito para el bofo...el bofo se perfila...vamos muchachos...bofo para matador...tuya, mia, tenla, te la presto , acariciamela, como se acaricia a la novia... el temo toma el balon ...solo...solo....solo....hay peligro de gol...tira....zambombazo.... gooooooooooooooolllllll.....el gol lo platicamos todos...entró hasta donde las arañas hacen su nido...donde los topos se meten con monse y donde los noviecitos se dan agarrones... " Lo cual es muy diferente.... Se fue Francia, en un campeonato que parecer ser destinado a convertirse en un cementerio de elefantes. Y pues a falta de francia, inglaterra y sobre todo alemania tendre aque irle a otro equipo y ahora mi favorito es suecia o portugal pero creo ke los griegos darán la sorpresa...

Well today was the last day that i have to assist to my junior highschool college... I'm not of that kind of people who cries for this, but let me tell you that it was sad to see all my classmates crying... But all our teachers gave us a few words of hope, joy, and why not, of reality... Like the math theacher who said all that sad thing just for make us cry and he was very happy to see some of us crying...he´s not bad, but that´s the way he is... The spanish teacher said two or three things to each one of us... that´s something nice if she say some nice things, but it was the oposite thing, she just focus on tell us our bad things.... From that moment it all was....Partyyyy!!!!!....whoa....well thats what we think until the chemistry teacher arrives...she order that we have to turn off the music...bahh...but we continue... Then the last moment came....with just 10 minutes to say goodbye to everyone that I see, it was all hughs, kisses and tears.... My friend alberto and me were the last who put a step outside of the college... Now it´s a new beginig...but I can't negate that I´m gonna miss this moments...

Well, what can we said about the new rock bands.... They only give a bad image sometimes, which probably give them an extra sale of albums, bad the songs they play are awful.... let´s just give an example: Limp Biskit, in the begining it was one of the top 5 bands of rock that were at the top of all popularity lists...but then they sing song about other things that was not "cool" in that moment Other bands that are not very known have a lot of pretty descent songs, or not?

How many of you have created an account at hotmail or yahoo and for some extrange reason it dissapears in just a few more days... Well this is because the bad service, at my point of view, that they give to their clients, i am one of them and i´m not very happy with the service... I think that Gmail (from the great google) is the solution that we need from a long time, and the only thing is that it´s only disponible for some people but I want an account... If someone of gmail is reading this please give an account at your mail... If some of you have a very different opinion abou this , please tell me I´ll hear it... Thats all for today...
We're all wearing the blue dress now.
So far my day has been positively uneventful. I went to work-out and the treadmill kept stopping for no obvious reason. And why do we call it working OUT anyway...I was on an indoor machine with a 3 foot extension chord. Work-OUT? I never work-out. I always work-in. I'm surrounded by rows of televisions and two radio stations playing simultaneously. It's a multi-media coctail. Add to that the fact that some people now jog and talk on their mobile phones at the same time, and it looks like our slight dependency has become a giant digital sucubus. I'm guilty too. Like most Americans, I will drive the 2 miles to the gym and then jog 5. (in my defense, the clouds do look quite threatening today, and I've long established that any gods that still reign on Mt. Olympus don't look at me favorably...better not risk it.) It does help to drive home the point that we have almost made another giant leap in evolution...With our increasing dependence on technology, we are making the leap from homo-sapiens to robo-sapiens. I definately see the downside...I have relatives that will spend 10 minutes trying to get their electric can openers to work when the simple twist version works just fine. Kerchunk! crank, crank, crank...Tuna. Never fails. I know people who run the a.c. and sleep under blankets. Our general philosophy seems to be that any machine, no matter how cumbersome and counter-productive it might be, is a relfection on its masters prowess. (And if said master manages to make it to retirement with 10 fingers, then that's just gravy!) When people drive, the distinction between the personality of the driver and the car is often blurred to the point that they are one entity. At least that's the justification I use when I flip-off everyone I see driving a hummer...as if one is needed. But bring on the robo-age, I say. I WANT to have a jet-pack installed. With x-ray vision! And a ray-gun! (Damn the pidgeons, full steam ahead!) I want to be able to slice, dice, and julien in the buff! And most importantly, I want to be able to call in sick because I've slipped in the shower and my hard-drive crashed! No more dodgy knees, trick shoulders, iffy ankles, or sketchy vision. And just think about what it could do to your sexual prowess. (I've just upgraded to bootyshack 3.0 baby...how's about coming back to my place? I'm built by Bill Gates, but I'm not micro, and I'm not soft...) Of course on the downside, all of us might come out sounding like Stephen Hawking. That's really the only thing that could make Celine Dion even more annoying. Damn it all, I say! Bring on the machines. Bring on the robo-sapiens. After all...robots are people too. Good-bye flesh and blood, hello rapture!
This post is a bit political and decidedly unsexy. I'm feeling a bit grumpy. GOP card carriers should probably back out now and say 10 hail marry's whilst watching Sean Hannity give Jesus, Mary, and Joseph a swedish deap tissue massage...with a happy ending. And if John Ashcroft is watching...bite me you fundamentalist fruitcake. And take the curtains off from around Lady Justice's nichons. It just makes you look silly, mate. Clinton-mania has landed. I'm a bit to the left of Clinton, so I didn't agree with everything he did, but he is the only president in my lifetime to use any kind of fiscal restraint. He was helping to reverse that horrible baby boomer trend started by Reagan and continued with the Shrub that says it is ok to run a monstrous national debt at the expense of younger Americans. These huge deficits will come back and cripple our economy in 15 to 20 years if we don't work for logical taxation that puts a heavier burden on the rich. Right now, the bulk of American taxes come from the middle-classes, while over 2/3rds of American multi-billion dollar corporations pay absolutely nothing. Everyone who is young needs to vote for someone who is going to pay for their own debts and not push them off on us...Which is exactly why they've been able to push their debts on us. Young people don't vote...death to the baby-boomers, I say! I wonder if it's too late to give FDR some mouth-to-mouth and have hime run for a fourth term. If nothing else, Ken Starr could investigate the inappropriate fondling of the president who created the American middle-class and won WW2. Heiha Hossa und Dreimal hoch für FDR! A wink and a nod to Clinton. A pink slip for King W. of Arabia.
It seems that the past and future french language assistants form a fairly tight knit community here on the web. Just an offer to anyone in the NC/SC area...some of us are going to try to get together a couple of times before we leave. I know people who will be in the Lille area (me) as well as a couple of friends who will be posted in Lyon (lucky bastard) and Limoges. Actually, I'm looking forward to being in a different corner of the hexagon. The first time I went to France, I studied in Dijon. Other than the food, the city doesn't offer much in the way of youth culture. For music fans, there were really only 2 options...there was a Kareoke bar where every French idol wanna be jammed out on Bridgette Bardot show-stoppers. I think I joined the anglo-crowd once or twice in a sloppy, drunken balls-to-the-wall rendition of "I will survive." It's all gravy to me, anyway. The second option involved a death metal band from somewhere in Belgium. Usually, music is a response to current cultural trends. Os Mutantes was political music railing against the right wingers in 1960's Brazil. The Vietnamese war spawned its fair share of sloppy, stoner ballads. Joy Division came from a hopelessy dreary dole-line existance in Manchester. What the hell is going on in Belgium that could make these guys so angry? They always looked so pissed off in their posters...I mean, these guys could make Rob Zombie look like the Olsen twins. They could rival Martha Stewart in raw negative energy. The looks on their faces just zapped my zen. Lille actually has quite a bit more to offer musically, or so I'm told. The last concert I saw here was Death Cab for Cutie and Pedro the Lion. Death Cab was amazing. I'm hoping to catch at least one French band play...right now I'm hoping for an Indochine tour or something. So Viva musik, viva youth culture, and viva la Francia.
Ok...Hope the sight looks easy on the eyes. It was either a choice between the retro dots or the o' so soothing seeweed green. (or possibly, baby-shit green...depends on your dispostion.) The black looked top-form as well, but that's just so 1981 Manchester. This is where I should introduce myself. NC geezah, gearing up to teach English in Valenciennes, a town 30 minutes away from Lille in the North of France. It will be my second time in france, and I'm practically bubbling over with optimism and anticipation. It's quite rare actually...I'm not much of a bubbler. I'll leave it at that for now... Jacob

Listening to "the Killers", playing with my new camera. My smile is under construction.
I've put up a new picture under my profile. I'm robo-sapien #2475BL-69-3001, the rugged, handsome brute on the left in Navy blue. In the red is my charming girl-friend, robo-sapien #2475LL-96-22. I've got a built in variable-speed can-opener.
Here I am in a London for my girlfriend's 24th birthday. They have Bento Boxes there that are worth every penny of the 15 quid price. You are seated with several other people at a table, which is usually quite nice, but we were placed with some roustabouts this particular time. The guy beside of me kept talking about how his ultimate dream was to move to Asia and live "off the sea" on some tiny island, eating only what he could catch. Two seconds later, he was banging on about how he can't go anywhere without his mobile, because it takes pictures and virgin allows him to text for 15p. I'm sure the life of a vietnamese peasant farmer allows little time or money for modern conveniences. You might get a text message and let dinner slip away. The picture is a bit grainy, but everyone can see at least one recent pic until I get my digital camera. You can even see my David Beckham faux-hawk.
Just wanted to give everyone (all three of you) an update (hi mom). I've gotten a picture put up, but it's a couple years old and taken on a shitty camera. I usually have two faces that make it to film...one is extremely pissed off and the other is high. When I'm not in the spotlight, my face seems to have a dizzying array of varied expressions, ranging from a "Who the hell are you?" grimace to an "Oh, brownies!" face. For some reason, I only have two in pictures. Really angry or stoned. I can blame the angry ones on my Prussian ancestory (my fondness for Kraut and my complete and utter sunlight intolerance as well.) I have no idea where the goofy ones come from...It's as if I suddenly lose control over my facial features as it distorts itself into the most insanely neurotic poses for it's own personal amusement. I chose one of the latter...Any of my King of Prussia picks would make me about as popular as Ronald McDonald in a vegan drum circle. Have a chat function as well...I go there sometimes to be alone. I can sing off tune and hear it echo off the cyber walls back at me in 4 part harmony. Don't go in there now though...It's a bit untidy. Should have a couple of new posts up soon, so stay tuned.
My Skin Hates Me Of course and as usual, my skin clears up when I have an appt. with the derm. Never when I have to attend a wedding with an ex who's bringing his new 6 foot tall blonde girlfriend who looks like she does a little modeling for Neutrogena on the side (when she's not busy with her extremely influential and high paying job). I'm going to have to beg for the Accutane again. I had an appt. with another derm about 6 months ago...a week before I saw him I looked like I had dipped my face in battery acid. The day of the appt. I woke up with the clearest skin I had ever had. It was insane. So, of course he won't give the 'tane. Gives me some of that topical crap that does absolutely nothing but make my gross zits itch, which is sweet. Because having big gross zits doesn't suck enough...lets see if we can make them itch too. AHHHH!If he had given it to me I would be done by now. But no...here I am, waiting for a derm appt. and watching my skin get clearer by the second. It's bad when you hope the zits stay long enough so theDr. doesn't think you're nuts. I'm wondering if I should just keep making appointments and then my skin will stay clear......
I am just wondering about my HTML skills and want to see if this will work. I am starting Accutane next week and have been inspired by the journals that other have kept. It looks like a long and slightly scary road- but one that promises results (somethingI have all but given up on). I will be posting a history next week (since my life long battle with cystic acne must be deeply interesting to the world on theweb....). My gut says that no one will even see this journal, but it feels good to just get this stuff off my chest (and forehead, and chin, and back haha).
OK...so I started the pills. Wow! People were right..those suckers are hard to open. They gave me the generic (Amnesteem) at 20 MG a day. They say take with food, so I've been taking it with dinner. Here's the round up: Day 1 Took first pill and waited to lightning to strike. I'm a little dramatic so of course I started to itch right away. As a result of a nice tan and the cortisone shot I got last week at the derm, the skin is looking better than it has in a long time. No real symptoms yet. Day 2 Had a few (maybe a few more than a few) drinks, figured there the stuff wasn't really in my system just yet. No real bad effects. Small hangover, but I think not an outstanding one. We'll see how that continues. Day 3 Uneventful. Day 4 Took in the evening with food. This is the first time I got a little bit of a stomach ache. Not sure if it was a back-to-work Sunday gernic malise, but I defnitely felt a little funny. The dry lips and itchy skin has started. I guess the fun begins here. I've been slathering myself with Aveeno and Aqaphor. My scalp is a little itchy too- might be time to switch from the oily hair shampoo to the mouturizing one. Who-hoo. One small step for man, one giant leap for an oily haired girl! More later.
Okay- so that fear about having skin too clear for the Doctor...no way. The day before the appointment I developed a cyst on my forehead about the diameter of a silver dollar that extended about a half inch from the skin. Good times, good times. On a positive note, the doctor took one look at me and said the words I've been waiting to hear: Accutane. They did the blood work and since there's no chance of me being knocked up, (acne is its own special kind of birth control haha) I was told I could start right away. He did the usual warnings, no sun, waxing, if I feel like I want to kill myself let him know. And that was it. He injected the medical monstrosity on my forehead. I've read a ton of other journals that say they hate the cortisone shots.....me, I love them. What would have taken three weeks to go away is gone in less than 24 hours. Three seconds of intense pain beats the hell out of needing to wear a Burka for a week. Also, the Derm said he was starting me at a baby dose (20 Mg once a day) and that meant I wouldn't get the initial breakout. He also said I can continue to drink socially (which I enjoy very much) until he says differently. I sincerely hope that both of these things are true. So I filled the script and went and stocked up on supplies. The other journals I've read were invaluable as far as this goes so, just in case anyone ever ends up reading this thing I'll be pretty specific about which products I'm using and how well they work. I bought: Aquaphor for the lips- I’m a chapstick addict anyway, so I already love this stuff. Aveeno- Intense Hand Relief Cream; Aveeno Intense Relief Moisturizer; Aveeno Intense Body Wash. If you can't already tell, I like the Aveeno stuff. I'm sticking to my regular shampoo for now, since it's for oily hair which I think will take a little while to stop. Face wash is some fancy shit I got from a Derm at a chi-chi spa in Soho called Gly-Sal. There is also a moisturizer, but I can't remember the name. I think I will end up switching to the Cetophil stuff since everyone rave about it- but, since I paid $45.00 for the crap I have I'll just finish it off. So I'm stocked up and ready to go. .....and it begins.
ANYONE HAVE A COOKIE? I NEED A COOKIE! Haha, yeah thats right, a cookie. Your missing out on a lot, and a great time if you have no idea what im saying. Tis a true mans sport, and girls love it ;). It's amazing how I went from shit, crying myself to sleep, to feeling amazing once again. Can you say mood swings :P. Hopefully things stay like this for a while again, it's a great feeling wich is always greatly missed. Haha, last night was a great time Saul. GO KERRY! We need to do shit like that all the time and work on our songs more too, it's a lot of fun. You are a great friend anyone would be honored to have. SHE CALLED THE COPS!!!!!! LOL!!!! Lol, well this is getting kind of long so im gonna end it, peace. ;) Quote: "My pens paint people that ive proven wrong" Music: R Kelly - The Worlds Greatest Mood: I am INVISIBLE!
I can't remember the time or place, or what you were wearing, it's unclear about how we met, all I know it was the best conversation that I've ever had, to this day I never found someone, with eyes as wide as yours, I've been searching up and down this coast, overlooking what I need the most did you notice I was afraid? I thought I'd run out of things to say, two more hours until today burns this away, and it starts all over again, the sky will never look the same again, till you show me how it could be, the sky will never look the same again, till you show me how it could be and everything else is irrelevant, to the story so far, a coincidence that you look like her from a far, is it true that you like to sleep alone? Or is it what you just tell everyone? Did you notice that I was afraid? I thought I'd run out of things to say two more hours until today burns this away, and it starts all over again the sky will never look the same again, till you show me how it could be the sky will never look the same again till you show me how it could be and when the world turns over ill keep my ears to the wall and when the world turns over ill keep my feet straight on the ground did u notice I was afraid? I thought I'd run out of things to say, two more hours until today burns this away, and it starts all over again, the sky will never look the same again till you show me how it could be the sky will never look the same again till you show me how it could be
Yeah so I have been very confused the past 2 days, and well last night I felt like I havn't felt in a long time, depressed. Over girls, what a suprise eh? Some things got drilld in my head, thanks for nothin kevin, and some things were said at the time by her, that didnt help. I dont know, some may say I am getting worked up over nothing, but what they consider nothing I consider everything. They have no idea how soon my time is comign to an end, and how much all this means to me. Maybe things will work out, maybe not. Once again thanks Kevin for the supporting words... not.

Yes, it has been a long time sinceI have made a post, but that is because summer school has started again and I have also been busy. Anyway, it is official, the car I am buying on my 18th birthday is a 1998 BMW Z3 Roadtser. Mint condition, jet black, convertable, 5 speed manual, black leather interior, and much more. I cant wait to be driving that around! So I have one postive thing, ok thats cool, there are a few other things too that have been making me feel great latley, and if they are reading this im sure they know who they are. Only problem is now, I amnot sure about it anymore. Not because of her nor me, butbecause of my stupid head. So I am not sure what I am going to do; sit and wait, or feel as though I dont have a chance or what. I dont know my head is just kind of going crazy. :-/ Quote: "We did it all for the glory of love" Music: New Found Glory - The Glory of Love Mood: Confused...
Well, it is official. Yesterday I had two meetings with the army, and I also took the practice test to join. I easily passed that, but I am still studying just to make sure I look real good :). I am either going to be an Infantryman or some type of computer job. Most likely an Infantryman. This gives me an opportunity to pocket 30k a year, and have a chance to go to college with it being paid for, not out of that 30k. So money wont be a problem either, since I will also be getting paid about 500 a month along with a yearly pay and so forth. *This is 2 year service pay, at minimum!* I am very excited about this opportunity, I have been wanting to do this since I was a kid. By doing this I can also finally prove myself to my parents. I suggest this to anyone who isn't sure what they want to do, or are even just thinking about it. It as an amazing opportunity that not enough people take advantage of. *Amazing full coverage health insurance and other great deals also. You are all missing out*
Well, the moding of my computer is done for a little while. I have spent a lot buying all the computer parts themselves which are top of the line, and even more of the lighting and moding equipment. The mods I have done so far are, window X in the side with blue Neon Cold Cathode light, flue LEDs in fan controller, blue LED in CD-Rom, Blue power and HDD LEDs (which are wee not yet installed when I took these pictures), a SAVKA cut in the other side of case where the window isn't, blue neon string under they keys on the keyboard, blue LED in mouse, blue tinted plastic on mouse, and last blue Neons in each side of the front of the sub, with blue tinted plexy glass over the front of subs and speakers. That is not all I plan on doing, I also will be installing blue Neon legs, but I am not sure when I am going to do that. I will also be buying the 6800U, best Video card on the market, which will be godly :). Here are some pictures of the mods without the blue power LED and blue HDD led not yet installed (They are now). urlLink Pic 1 urlLink Pic 2
Well summer school is finally done, and I passed with a B-. Like every week of summer school, I almost got kicked out :-/. I truly think all the teachers are constantly out to get me, but hey forget them, I'm done at West. Next year I will be going to central because I am to much of a failure I guess :-/. Senior year is finally here, and I will be spending it with none of my friends. Hopefully I hang out with them out side of school. Hell, I cant even go to homecoming or prom, which is really bumming me out. I don't even know if I will be allowed to attend any of the sport games, if they don't let me hell will beak loose! I just want to forget about this now, sorry I would post much more, but I have to help my friend who is very depressed.

Right now I just have this feeling I am alone. I had something great, something I havnt felt in 3-4 years. It's gone now, and the chances of it coming back are probably very low :-/. I still feel my half of it, but the other was left behind somewhere. Sometimes I wish I didnt have feelings, then I wouldnt feel hurt or alone, but I guess it was my own mistakes. The other half wouldnt be gone if I wasnt such a dumbass. What am I thinking, yeah theres so much I want to say, but I better shut up befor I make things even worse.
I have no problem with staying friends, for now. Little confusing, but I can understand where you are coming from. Just please, dont forget about me and how I feel. I'm always here for you every step of the way, and I hope everything gets sorted out and works. You are an amazing girl, and I am willing to wait for that. You will always have a piece of my heart.
So much is going wrong for everyone. So much is messed up. Lately I have been feeling alone and i'd rather not say why anymore, no one really seems to care. I also dont wanna bitch anymore. Hello? Is anyone there.... anyone?
A real friend is someone who you can sit in complete silence with and still walk away feeling like you just had the best conversation of your life. And that is exactly how I feel with Laura. Knowing that she knows I really do care, and knowing that I actualy mean something to her. Laura you are the best! Our time to be together will come some time, i hope, but i will not rush that time to come any sooner. I want it to work out, and show you how great things can be. Love ya Laura!
I am heaven sent. Don't you dare forget. I am all you've ever wanted. What all the other boys all promised. Sorry I told. I just needed you to know. I think in decimals and dollars. I am the cause to all your problems. Shelter from cold. We're never alone. Coordinate brain and mouth. Then ask me what it's like to have myself so figured out. I wish I knew. I hope this song starts a craze. The kind of song that ignites the airwaves. The kind of song that makes people glad to be where they are with who ever they're there with. This is war. Every line is about who I don't wanna write about anymore. I hope you come down with something they can't diagnose, don't have the cure for. Holding on to your grudge. Oh, it's so hard to have someone to love. And keeping quiet is hard. Cause you can't keep a secret if it never was a secret to start. At least pretend you didn't want to get caught. We're consentrating on falling apart. We were contenders, now throwing the fight. I just wanna believe... in us. Oh, were so contraversial. We are entirely smooth. We admit to the truth. We are the best at what we do. And these are the words you wish you wrote down. This is the way you wish your voice sounds. Handsome and smart. Oh, my tongue's the only muscle in my body that works harder than my heart. And it's all from watching TV. And from speeding up my breathing. Wouldn't stop if I could. Oh, it hurts to be this good. You're holding on to your grudge. Oh, it hurts to always have to be honest with the one that you love. Oh, so let it go. We're consentrating on falling apart. We were contenders, now throwing the fight. I just wanna believe... We're consentrating on falling apart. We were contenders, now throwing the fight. I just wanna believe... in us. This is the craze only we can bestow. This is the price you pay for loss of control. This is the break in the battle. This is the closest of calls. This is the reason you're alone. This is the reason you fall. We're consentrating on falling apart. We were contenders, now throwing the fight. I just wanna believe... We're consentrating on falling apart. We were contenders, now throwing the fight. I just wanna believe... in us.
Keep the noise low, she doesn't wanna blow it. She stripped from head to toe and then left him with his shoulder out. Go get your heartbeat. It beats me straight into the ground. You don't recover from a night like this. Our victim, still lying in bed, completely motionless. A hand moves in the dark to her zipper. And a boy best in tourniquet sheets barely whispers, "This is so messed up." Upon arrival the guests had all stared. Dripping wet and clearly depressed, he'd headed straight for the stairs. No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch, unprepared for a life filled with lies and failing relationships. (Up the stairs, the station where the act becomes the art of growing up.) He keeps his hands low, he doesn't wanna blow it. He's wet from head to toe and his eyes give her the up and the down. His stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up. Get the body on the bed like it's flowered and he starts going down. The people, the focus. The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to settle. Die young and save yourself. They take all the taste out. It used to be the reason that we're even, now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself. She hits the lights. This doesn't seem quite fair. Despite everything he learned from his friends, he doesn't feel so prepared. She's breathing quiet and smooth, he's gasping for air. "This is the first and last time", he said. She fakes a smile and presses her hips into his. He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides. He's holding back from telling her exactly what it really feels like. He is the lamb, she is the slaughter. She's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her. Nothing that he touches is really having an effect. He whispers that he loves her, but she's probably only looking for... (Up the stairs, the station where the act becomes the art of growing old.) So much more than he could ever give. A life full of lies and failing relationships. He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides. He waits for it to end and for the aching in his guts to subside. The people, the focus. The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to settle. Die young and save yourself. They take all the taste out. It used to be the reason that we're even, now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself. Up the stairs, the station where the act becomes the art of growing old. The people, the focus. The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to settle. Die young and save yourself. They take all the taste out. It used to be the reason that we're even, now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself.
Yesterday, yeah, was a very great day. I went to Lauras and gave her the presents I got her from Chicago, and then stayed there and hung out for a while. She wouldnt let me see her room, since it was a mess, but she let me see everywhere else. So eventualy I just broke into her room :P. I had a lot of fun as I was there. I would go into more detial but a certian person she did not have a good night with last night might see and get mad or it may make things werse :-/. Sorry last night was hell Laura, I really hope you feel bette, keep a smile on that beautiful face. Remember, im always here and always will care. *Laura has NSYNC and BACK STREET BOY concert tickets on her door!!!! HAHAHAHAHA! ;) Love ya Laura ;) *She wouldnt sing or dance for me :( ... I still want to see that c-walk. ;)
CHORUS: hey there would you like to go out some time hey there maybe come to my place after i said hey there but this is only a dream... i hate being that sensative soft guy why cant i be the tough guy then i wouldnt be this shy id be that stupid ignorant guy why cant you girls see that theres more to me then what you see just give me time and ill break out of this shell and i wont be shy then you ditch me for that ignorant guy why do you always have to be so mean to me cant you see what you mean to me just give me a chance and ill prove to be... oh yeah, thats right... im just that shy guy shy guy that shy guy fuck this im escaping this dream and you will soon belong to me and then maybe ill be free because youre here with me [Chorus]
Well I just got back from Chicago, and let me tell ya, it's not worth it :P. Atleast it wasn't for me. I would have rather stayed at home and hung out with Laura. Yes for you guys there are a lot of girls there, but when you really like some one back home it sucks. They kept reminding me of her. Oh they are also annoying and like to ask for numbers and give you a lot of smiles. No one got my number Laura, nonono :). Allthough there were 3 girls who joined me in the hot tub, they werent annoying and we just talked about the hotel. Ha it was hilarious, they were joining me in complaining about the hotel. Then I ditched them, haha. All I wanted to do was come home, see Laura, and give her the gifts I got :). And well that time has arrived, and now im happy. :)
Well, today was a good day, I cheered up the one person that means everything to me, Laura. I went out and bought a lot of art supplys and made her a huge card, half the size of her :). It was mainly pink, since she loves the color pink, with feathers and colored cotton ball things all over it. For the letter itself I used those letter sticker things instead of writing it which looked really good and matched the look. For the cover I bought this big foam thing which was 3 flowers and bees. I had so many sweet ideas, but I couldnt do them all, I ran out of supplys, so I couldn't even do everything I wanted to. No biggie, the point still got accross, that I truley care, and I made her smile for her first time all day. *Oh it had white hearts and stuff too, and a design for the outer trim, pretty sweet lookin if you ask me.* Love ya Laura. :) Great thoughts to end with in your head befor i'm gone to Chicago :-/
I am posting because my life was threatened emotionally and physically if I didn't post. So because of that I don't really know what to put, except that I am having a great time talking with Laura and I am learning a lot of things :). A walk some time would be nice, we should do that. Anyway I want to get back to talking to that great girl. Have a good day everybody, peace.
Thank you everyone for a great weekend, Cody, Kimmie, Luke, Jack, Cindy, Josh, Melissa, Erika, them other 2 girls, forget there names :P. Anyway I had a great time and have never been around such a great group of people. You guys are so much fun, although I wish her birthday could have gone better :-/. Last night wasn't the best of night due to some things I herd, which triggered some stuff in my brain that was long forgotten. Sorry Cody if it hurt you. Kimmie, wtf. Jim, ha, don't even try and start, you don't know what can be done. By going this weekend I know I brought a lot of joy to peoples hearts, and I am greatful for that. I also brought some sadness, poor Laura ;), she missed me so much she left me 80 messages in like 2 min :-D. Anyway, I really appreciate everything all of you do, not just who I listed, but everyone. I have some great friends. And Laura, I will miss you this week. :( Quote: "Can't you tell that I'm loosing myself" Music: New Found Glory - Forget My Name Mood: I really don't know

Attention Info Addicts: RSS is a great thing. It stands for many things, but in my world, RSS stands for only one: bringing information to my desktop. It's like having a program that continually hits news websites for new headlines, security sites for new advisories, blogs for new postings, etc, and placing all of the new information into one simple program, ready of you to digest. Personally I get the latest advisories, news, tech news, tech blogs, and even info on hockey all in one place - reducing the need to hit 20 or 30 websites every 30 minutes to stay on top of the game. Here's a few links you'll need to get started: Recommended Reader: urlLink Wildgrape NewsDesk - this free program is fast and easy.

This is an interesting passage from theInquirer.net: "The notion of copyright infringement as theft was clearly addressed in the 1985 Supreme Court decision of Dowling v. United States. While this case involved hard goods (phonograph records), Justice Harry Blackmun was most certainly speaking of abstract property (copyrights) when he wrote these words in his majority decision overturning Dowling's conviction of interstate transport of stolen property: '(copyright infringement) does not easily equate with theft, conversion, or fraud... The infringer invades a statutorily defined province guaranteed to the copyright holder alone. But he does not assume physical control over copyright; nor does he wholly deprive its owner of its use.'"

Syntax ntbackup backup [systemstate] "bks file name" /j {"job name"} [/p {"pool name"}] [/g {"guid name"}] [/t { "tape name"}] [/n {"media name"}] [/f {"file name"}] [/d {"set description"}] [/ds {"server name"}] [/is {"server name"}] [/a] [/v:{yes|no}] [/r:{yes|no}] [/l:{f|s|n}] [/m {backup type}] [/rs:{yes|no}] [/hc:{on|off}] [/um] Parameters SWITCH DESCRIPTION systemstate Specifies that you want to back up the system state data. When you back up the system state data, all of the system state data is backed up, so the /s switch does not apply. Also, the backup type is forced to normal or copy. bks file name Specifies the name of the backup selection file (.bks file) to be used for the backup operation. A backup selection file contains information on the files and folders that you have selected for backup. You have to create the file by using the graphical user interface (GUI) version of Backup. /j {"job name"} Specifies the job name to be used in the log file. The job name usually describes the files and folders that you are backing up in the current backup job as well as the date and time at which you backed up the files. /p {"pool name"} Specifies the media pool from which you want to use media. This is usually a subpool of the Backup media pool, such as 4mm DDS. If you select this, do not use the following switches: /a /g /f /t. /g {"guid name"} Overwrites or appends to this tape. Do not use this switch in conjunction with /p. /t{"tape name"} Overwrites or appends to this tape. Do not use this switch in conjunction with /p. /n {"media name"} Specifies the new tape name. Do not use /a with this switch. /f {"file name"} Logical disk path and file name. You cannot use the following switches with this switch: /p /g /t. /d {"set description"} Specifies a label for each backup set. /ds {"server name"} Backs up the directory service file for the specified Microsoft Exchange server. The /DS command line switches for NTBackup (with Exchange 5.5) no longer work with NTBackup for Exchange 2000. The Directory Store (DS) switch is not relevant since Exchange 2000 uses the Windows 2000 Active Directory. The Information Store (IS) switch does not apply since the structure of the Information Store has changed from Exchange 5.5 /is {"server name"} Backs up the Information Store file for the specified Exchange server. The /IS command line switches for NTBackup (with Exchange 5.5) no longer work with NTBackup for Exchange 2000. The Directory Store (DS) switch is not relevant since Exchange 2000 uses the Windows 2000 Active Directory. The Information Store (IS) switch does not apply since the structure of the Information Store has changed from Exchange 5.5 /a Performs an append operation. Either /g or /t must be used in conjunction with this switch. Do not use this switch in conjunction with /p. /v:{yes|no} Verifies the data after the backup is complete. /r:{yes|no} Restricts access to this tape for the owner or members of the Administrators group. /l:{f|s|n} Specifies the type of log file: f=full, s=summary, n=none (with n, no log file is created). /m {backup type} Specifies the backup type. It must be one of the following: normal, copy, differential, incremental, or daily. /rs:{yes|no} Backs up the Removable Storage database. /hc:{on|off} Uses hardware compression, if it is available, on the tape drive. /um Finds the first available media, formats it, and uses it for the current backup operation. Use the /p switch to designate a device-type media pool when you use the /um switch so that Backup searches for the appropriate type of media, such as 4mm DDS. When you use the /um switch, Backup searches the following media pools for available media: Free pool, Import pool, Unrecognized pool, and Backup pool. When available media is found, the search stops and the media is formatted and then used without prompting you for input. This command is not applicable to tape loaders and you should only use it if you have a standalone tape device.
Here's some interesting news: urlLink Microsoft's SUS Website: Software Update Services now provides Windows service packs (SPs), in addition to critical and security updates. SUS will deliver Windows XP SP1, Windows 2000 SP4, and all future service packs for Windows 2000, Windows XP, and the Windows Server™ 2003 family of products. This will sure save some wear and tear on the shoes but trying to use this to deploy on a large number of hosts will not. Some suggest to set up several SUS servers or to use GPO to control deployments. For those of you who do not know about SUS, go here: urlLink Software Update Services . It is a free and easy way to provide critical updates and (now) service packs to your client pcs/servers instead of manually doing them or having your users go to Windows Update to patch themselves. You also have the power to approve which updates are installed. This website urlLink SUSserver.com is a great resource for SUS.
I've seen several tips on freeing up CPU cycles by enacting this minor tweak. Here's the how-to: This excerpt from urlLink Windows-Help.NET : "To disable the Indexing service, open Computer Management from Administrative Tools (on the Start menu if you enabled this, or from the Control Panel), select Services and Applications, double click Services, and find the Indexing Service. Double click to bring up the Properties window, and click Stop to let Windows stop the service. Then from the Status type drop down box select Disabled. "
urlLink MSBlast copycat set to pounce, firm says | CNET News.com Here's even more warning to all of you out in SysAdminHell. I've heard multiple sources say that it's only a matter of days before said worm is released, and it won't be pretty. For those of you who don't like to patch, get your resumes ready. I heard that the Real Estate industry is doing rather well.
Ok guys.. I just received this email on the NTSysAdmin mailing list: The PSS Security team is issuing this alert to advise customers that on Saturday 9/13/03 a research company called XXXXXX published a paper providing guidance on how to exploit the vulnerabilities patched by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-039. To date we've had no reports of actual exploit code being publicly available or being used actively in a worm or virus The paper makes it very simple to your 11 year old neighbor to write a worm with this exploit. Patch your systems!! Mine are all patched (as of today) so get busy. Find out more about the urlLink PSS Security Team .
Here's a quick and easy way to gather information from Active Directory and import it into a spreadsheet: Run Active Directory Users and Computers. Select View -> Add/Remove Columns, and add the columns you want to display and export (e-mail address, last name, etc.). Select the Users container or another organizational unit (OU) within your Active Directory hierarchy. Right click on this same container/OU, select Export List and provide a path/filename. Open up the exported text file with Microsoft Excel or another spreadsheet application. You now have the information you need in spreadsheet format.
Here's a good hint: Enable Account Management Auditing Sometimes you want to know what is going on w/ your Active Directory at all times (who wouldn't right?). User lockouts, creations, deletions, etc. To get these events into your event logs, you must enable the Audit account management policy for both success and failure. Here's how: 1. Log into your domain controller. 2. Select Domain Controller Security Policy under Administrative Tools in the start menu. 3. Find your way through security settings, local policies, audit policy. 4. Enable Audit Account Management for success and failure. 5. Done. Look out for these events in your event logs (or use a filter program, such as EventSentry). 624 - user account creation 642 - user account changed 630 - user account deleted 628 - user account password set 627 - user account password attempt 644 - user account locked out 642 - user account changed: account disabled 645 - computer account created 647 - computer account deleted 635 - local group created 639 - local group changed 638 - local group deleted 631 - global group created 641 - global group changed 634 - global group deleted Many thanks to urlLink Windows .Net Magazine for publishing such a great article on this. If you don't regularly read this magazine, then you're no SysAdmin (well, in the Windows world at least).
Hey kids. INSTALL THE MS03-039 PATCH NOW!!! This is no bloody joke. Yesterday afternoon Microsoft had the nerve to disrupt my already busy day by releasing urlLink Microsoft TechNet Security Bulletin MS03-039 which is yet ANOTHER hole in the RPC service. Every single Windows NT kernel-based computer is affected (2k, NT, 2k3, XP). Blaster 2 is only a matter of tweaking the original Blaster worm, so patch now. I've been watching the lists and newsgroups closely (as well as my own installations) and haven't seen any issues with this patch as of yet. It may also be of interest to grab the free Eeye RPC scanner urlLink here to get a good look at what's vulnerable on your networks.

urlLink Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-043 hole. I suggest disabling the {useless} Messenging Service on all of your Windows devices to ward off this vuln and any future holes that may be found. The easiest way to do this in an AD environment is to use Group Policy. Here's the article: urlLink Son of MSBlast on the way? | CNET News.com : "Released on a security mailing list earlier this week, the program takes advantage of a flaw in Microsoft's Messenger Service to cause Windows-based computers to crash. The vulnerability affects almost every current Microsoft Windows system, leaving security experts concerned that independent hackers will quickly find a way to take control of a large number of computers by exploiting the flaw. " "I think we are going to see a repeat of the (MSBlast worm)," said Vincent Weafer, senior director of Symantec's antivirus research center, referring to the program that spread across the Internet in August. The program used a similarly widespread Windows flaw to break through computers' security. "It took three weeks (for hackers) to figure out a working worm in that case."

For those of you that need to schedule defrag on Windows2000, take a look at urlLink MorphaSys AutoDeFrag . AutoDeFrag is a launcher for the standard defragmenter built into Windows 2000. The standard defragmenter does not support the ability to be scheduled, and therefore must be manually launched when required, once for each fixed disk in your system. AutoDeFrag works around this limitation and allows the Windows 2000 Task Scheduler to be used to schedule the defragmenter. AutoDeFrag is a tiny (~50k) Win32 console application that does not require any user input. Just copy the .exe into a folder (like in \winnt) and schedule, or use the at command via command prompt.
This is awesome! SpamBayes is a free, open-source spam-killing plugin for Outlook and Outlook Express. Using the superior Bayesian mathematical method and a self-training method, this program can achieve 99% spam blocking functionality within a week of use. This is my spam solution, and it's worth a try. A TechTV write-up on SpamBayes: urlLink TechTV | SpamBayes: Spam Prevention With Smarts Download the plugin here: urlLink SpamBayes Outlook Addin or here: urlLink SpamBayes: Bayesian anti-spam classifier written in Python. Quote from urlLink spambayes.sourceforge.net : SpamBayes will attempt to classify incoming email messages as 'spam', 'ham' (good, non-spam email) or 'unsure'. This means you can have spam or unsure messages automatically filed away in a different mail folder, where it won't interrupt your email reading. First SpamBayes must be trained by each user to identify spam and ham. Essentially, you show SpamBayes a pile of email that you like (ham) and a pile you don't like (spam). SpamBayes will then analyze the piles for clues as to what makes the spam and ham different. For example; different words, differences in the mailer headers and content style. The system then uses these clues to examine new messages.

I know I went on and on about this exploit weeks ago, but this time it's a little different. Here's a post from the urlLink NTSysAdmin list: rpc-dcom2 exploitIt doesn't matter if your system is patched. I tried this against a fully patched win2k and a fully patched XP system. Both systems crashed or crucial operating system services crashed but explorer remained up. Microsoft admits that WinXP SP1, even though patched, got exploited (but says that they haven't tested it on other platforms). This is bad, really bad. Here's a little help: Snort signature: alert TCP any any -> any 135 (msg:"RPC Vulnerability - bind initiation";sid:1; rev:1; content:"|05 00 0B 03 10 00 00 00 48 00 00 00 7F 00 00 00 D0 16 D0 16 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 01 00 01 00 a0 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 C0 00 00 00 00 00 00 46 00 00 00 00 04 5D 88 8A EB 1C C9 11 9F E8 08 00 2B10 48 60 02 00 00 00|"; flow:to_server,established;classtype:attempted-admin;) One suggestion would be to turn off these services and to block ports TCP 135, 139, 445 and 593; and UDP 135, 137, 138 and 445.

"Late last week, Microsoft released a fix that addressed a way the flaw could be exploited but didn't fix the ADODB.Stream object itself, iDefense said in its advisory. 'I would not be surprised to see another wave of quiet, yet dangerous, Trojan attacks in light of this new exploit code,' Ken Dunham, iDefense's director of malicious code, said in the advisory. Reston, Va.-based iDefense recommends users set a kill bit in the Windows registry to prevent the attack.

urlLink Pioneer Press | 10/03/2003 | : "Sen. Norm Coleman, two days after holding a high-profile hearing on the recording industry's anti-piracy campaign, said Thursday he will push legislation this year to reduce legal penalties for people who download copyrighted music off the Internet. Coleman, R-Minn., said current penalties, $750 to $150,000 per song downloaded, are excessive and enough to scare innocent people into settling lawsuits filed by the recording industry." Coleman said he will also press for changes in federal law to curb the recording industry's subpoena power.

A zero-day exploit targeting an Internet Explorer vulnerability (versions 5 and forward) is being used to install a Trojan. Experts warn that it's only a prelude to a series of attacks that are likely to wreck havoc given the number of unprotected systems. "This zero-day exploit is huge. It will likely be a major, and highly successful, vector of attack upon thousands of computers for some time," says Ken Dunham, malicious code intelligence manager at iDEFENSE. "We have verified that attackers are installing backdoor Trojans and dialers on targeted computers at will." "Multiple examples of the exploit code are available for attackers to analyze and use in crafting their own attack," adds Dunham. "This type of code availability and underground activity traditionally foreshadows a flurry of malicious attacks." Microsoft first issued a patch for the 'object type' vulnerability on Aug. 20. The flaw allows an attacker to compromise a system by embedding malicious code in a Web page. If the Web page is viewed with a fully patched IE browser, the malicious code embedded in the Web page will execute. The 'object type' vulnerability patch doesn't prevent this variation of the flaw, but Microsoft plans to issue a fix shortly. - From Security Wire Digest to subscribe, go to urlLink http://infosecuritymag.bellevue.com

urlLink New Windows Worm on the Way? With the posting Wednesday of proof-of-concept exploit code for one of the newly discovered vulnerabilities in Windows, the familiar chain of events that often leads to the release of a worm has begun. Less than 24 hours after Microsoft issued the fix, two members of the BugTraq security mailing list posted exploit code for the vulnerability. The author of one of the exploits said the code had been tested only on a Windows 2000 machine with Service Pack 4 installed and the FAT32 file system running. The other exploit is designed for machines running Windows XP. However, experts said it would take little effort to adapt the code for other Windows machines. And, more importantly, the Workstation vulnerability appears to be a prime candidate for a worm

Ok, ok, so this has NOTHING to do with Sysadmin issues.. but this is cool anyways. I got this PS2 for my birthday last summer from a pawn shop.

Now I can't watch all of those R-rated movies I've invested so much in. If you ever run into this problem, put in the dvd, reboot the ps2, and at the parental lock password screen press the select button and type in the code 7444 (this is the master code). Now enter your own code. Once the dvd starts, press the select button and choose setup. Press right to go to the "region" menu and change "level" to off.

More proof that firewalls aren't always the only answer: urlLink Security Experts Warn of New Way to Attack Windows - Microsoft Corp. issued a patch for the vulnerability in November, but the security bulletin also listed several workarounds for the flaw, including disabling the Workstation Service and using a firewall to block specific UDP and TCP ports. But penetration testers at Core Security Technologies, a Boston-based security company, discovered a new attack vector that uses a different UDP port . This attack still allows the malicious packets to reach the vulnerable Workstation Service.
urlLink Techweb > News > Windows Messenger Service security woes > Big New Chink Found In Windows Messenger Service > December 9, 2003 - According to analysis done by Symantec's DeepSight Threat Analyst Team, the Windows Messenger Service vulnerability can be exploited by a single UDP broadcast, allowing a wholesale compromise of all vulnerable systems on the targeted network. “If I can exploit one single box on your network, I can exploit all of them,” Huger added. “An application doesn't care about UDP,” said Huger. “It takes the packet, period, with no authentication.” A worm just 2.7K in size would be enough to simultaneously infect up to 254 machines. Although that's larger than the minute 376 bytes used by SQLSlammer, “the difference is really trivial,” Huger said. Not only might such a worm spread faster than Slammer, its damage could significantly outweigh Slammer's damage, for it would have a much greater number of potential targets. The Windows Messenger Service vulnerability exists not just in enterprise machines -- as with Slammer -- but also countless home computers running Windows.

The actual URL syntax in the link--which appears in the IE address bar when the link is clicked, and also at the bottom of the IE window when someone rolls over the link with the cursor--looks like this: http(s)://username:password@server/resource.ext. The browser uses whatever is to the right of the @ symbol to locate the Web page. Everything to the left of the @ is used to authenticate the user. If there is no authentication mechanism available on the targeted page, the beginning part of the URL is ignored. Attackers, then, can use the area to the left of the @ symbol to create a fake Web address and fool victims into going to a different page or site. For instance, the URL http://www.cnet.com@example.com looks like it will go to the Web site www.cnet.com, but it actually goes to http://example.com. "

urlLink Code attacks Windows vulnerability | CNET News.com - A piece of code that exploits a critical vulnerability that Microsoft issued a patch for only last week has been posted online, raising fears of an imminent MSBlast-style attack. On Feb. 10, Microsoft released a patch that fixes a networking flaw affecting all Windows XP, NT, 2000 and Windows Server 2003 systems. The company warned people to patch their systems because the vulnerability could be exploited by virus and worm writers. Four days after the patch was released, a piece of code was published on a French Web site that would let anyone exploit the vulnerability, meaning that unpatched customers could be hit with a worm similar to last summer's MSBlast, also known as Blaster. *Note:* Everyone needs to patch as soon as possible but be careful; I've heard mixed reviews about this one.. including domain controllers not booting or allowing anyone to log on after the patch has been applied.

The vulnerability is caused by an unchecked buffer in the Microsoft ASN.1 Library, which could result in a buffer overflow. An attacker who successfully exploited this buffer overflow vulnerability could execute code with system privileges on an affected system. The attacker could then take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing data, changing data, deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges. Because ASN.1 is a standard for many applications and devices, there are many potential attack vectors. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must force a computer to decode malformed ASN.1 data. For example, when using authentication protocols based on ASN.1 it could be possible to construct a malformed authentication request that could expose this vulnerability. Server systems are at greater risk than client computers because they are more likely to have a server process running that decodes ASN.1 data. So basically, this is in *almost* every Windows system (not installed by default on WinNT), there is no workaround, there are a wide numbers of attack vectors (not like you could just block a port), and servers will most likely be hit easier than workstations. Couple this with the IE update earlier this month (which breaks websites) and it looks like I'll have some overtime on my hands. THANKS MICROSOFT!!!

urlLink IE security patch nixes some apps | CNET News.com Some Web developers are complaining that an Internet Explorer patch that's meant to foil Net scams is disabling some applications that didn't put a premium on security. Microsoft last week announced that a modification to its IE browser would stop the insecure practice of including sensitive information in links. The update, which was released Monday, had some Web site programmers up in arms Wednesday due to complaints from Web users that they could no longer log in to sites that secure entry through credentials included in the URL. "Microsoft may have legitimate reasons for addressing the issue, but the way they addressed it--an across-the-board kill of an industry standard--is troublesome," said James Rosko, a software engineer for a data-processing service on the Web. He and other programmers spent Tuesday night making changes to the programs that process login requests for his company's Web site, which he requested not be named. --- This *could* be a problem for some users who have to log into bank websites to do business. Make sure you test this with your users before deploying.

urlLink Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-004 - Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (832894) - Fixes 3 security issues, one of which is rated critical. - A vulnerability that involves the cross-domain security model of Internet Explorer. The cross domain security model of Internet Explorer keeps windows of different domains from sharing information. This vulnerability could result in the execution of script in the Local Machine zone. - A vulnerability that involves performing a drag-and-drop operation with function pointers during dynamic HTML (DHTML) events in Internet Explorer. This vulnerability could allow a file to be saved in a target location on the user's system if the user clicked a link. No dialog box would request that the user approve this download. - A vulnerability that involves the incorrect parsing of URLs that contain special characters. When combined with a misuse of the basic authentication feature that has "username:password@" at the beginning of a URL, this vulnerability could result in a misrepresentation of the URL in the address bar of an Internet Explorer window.

urlLink 287497 - How to Use the Inbox Repair Tools to Recover Messages From urlLink Lockergnome : The Inbox Repair Tool can be used to fix corrupt PST files and even OST files. Although the tool can be useful, it isn't always able to repair every PST file. It works by repairing the PST file's header and then deleting anything in the file that it doesn't understand. So if a PST file's header is damaged, as may be the case for corruption that occurs during a version upgrade of Office, the tool should have no trouble making the repair. But if the data within the file is corrupt, the Inbox Repair Tool will likely destroy what's left of the file. That's why it's always good to make a backup of the PST file before running the Inbox Repair Tool.

Windows Update Services (WUS) is the new name for the next version of the update management solution currently known as Software Update Services (SUS). Windows Update Services will support updating Windows®, Office, SQL Server™, and other Microsoft products and will provide significantly expanded capabilities over SUS. After reading the urlLink WUS data sheet I've found quite a few additions to the original SUS that I've been looking for in 3rd-party patch management tools: 1. Updates all MS products, as well as critical driver updates, non-critical updates, etc. 2. Ability to scan systems for missing patches. 3. Ability to uninstall updates, including group uninstall. 4. Target systems for update deployment. 5. Network optimization - BITS, MSI, download resumption, optimization for branch offices. 6. Status reports allow admins to easily determine update deployment status (success, failure, error, etc) 7. Allows extensive logging to SQL database. 8. Client software will auto-update itself if necessary. 9. Can be deployed in a hierachial topology (parent/child servers). 10. Encrypts communications between WUS and the Microsoft Udate download servers as well as server-server and server-client communications. 11. Uses digital signatures to verify updates are from Microsoft. 12. Easier Admin interface - new design. 13. Group policy client configuration. 14. Ability to specify which updates get deployed on specifically targeted machines. 15. Allows for command-line and script-based control. I'm hoping to get to play with this sometime soon (hurry and release a beta Microsoft!!). WUS looks like it could kill the 3rd party solutions I was testing and all this for FREE!! It looks like it has the best features from several 3rd party products I've seen - just hope it works as well as it looks. Fuck SUS, go WUS!

As of right now, there are 2 other variants of this worm. A friend of mine called me from his job Sunday evening for help clearing it off of most of the computers in his department. It's pretty nasty, seems to totally screw up the LSASS service. (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service provides an interface for managing local security, domain authentication, and Active Directory processes. It handles authentication for the client and for the server.) He had issues opening programs (event viewer, msconfig, etc) because of authentication issues, the computer would reboot, safe mode would have issues, the cpu would max out.. Here are details from urlLink Symantec: 1. Attempts to create a mutex called Jobaka3 and exits if the attempt fails. This ensures that no more than one instance of the worm can run on the computer at any time. 2. Copies itself as %Windir%\avserve2.exe. 3. Adds the value: "avserve2.exe"="%Windir%\avserve2.exe" to the registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run so that the worm runs when you start Windows. 4. Uses the AbortSystemShutdown API to hinder attempts to shut down or restart the computer. 5. Starts an FTP server on TCP port 5554. This server is used to spread the worm to other hosts. 6. Attempts to connect to randomly-generated IP addresses on TCP port 445. If a connection is made to a computer, the worm sends shellcode to that computer which may cause it to run a remote shell on TCP port 9996. The worm then uses the shell to cause the computer to connect back to the FTP server on port 5554 and retrieve a copy of the worm. This copy will have a name consisting of 4 or 5 digits followed by _up.exe (eg 74354_up.exe).

It delays executing anything immediately but instead uses another unknown vulnerability to run another file which in turn runs some script. This script is then used to run more script. And finally that script is used to run an exploit that Microsoft Corp. has been aware of since August 2003 but hasn't patched. That exploit -- Adodb.stream -- has not been viewed as particularly dangerous, since it only works when the file containing the code is present on the user's hard disk. The problem comes in the fact that the Help file initially opened is assumed to be safe since it is a local file and so has minimal security restrictions. "

urlLink How do I install applications for use with Terminal Server? : "There are two modes in terminal server, Execute and Install. By default all users are logged on in Execute mode and this means they can run programs etc. When you want to install an Application for use by everyone the Administrator should change to Install mode. The best way to install software is to use the Add/Remove programs control panel applet as this will automatically set the mode to Install during the installation and then back to Execute at the end. Alternatively you can manually change your mode to install by typing C:\> change user /install To change back to execute use C:\> change user /execute And to check you current mode use C:\> change user /query"

urlLink I don't get it ... M. is tired and exhausted from working so much (I can understand that) but for some reason we don't seem to be on the same page today. I don't know if it's because he's looking to be left alone and I'm looking for some company or what. We argued a bit about something ridiculous and he was being a total butt (and not the HoneyDew kind) and when I asked him why he wasn't listening to me he accused me of WHINING. Good grief I hate that word. It makes me feel like a pesky-weakling with nothing better to do than complain about how bad their life is. I'm NOT at all like that. I'm not always peaches and cream and when something bothers me, I say so. When a man says that a women is 'whining', what he's really saying is "I don't have the mental capacity to carry on this conversation." They want out and the only way to do that is to insult. Ok ... I'm done venting now. Not long after our disagreement, M. took my hand and kissed it and held it close. Good Lord, I can't stay mad at him. I used to be able to .. but now he's so far burrowed into my heart that I have no control over it anymore. I do love him ... so very very much! urlLink M.
Well, the day is slipping by and M. isn't home yet. I didn't think he would be getting off around 2 or 3 like he said. Silly boy. I've gotten all my house work done and have the laundry in the washer. For the past hour or so, I've been playing Cribbage on Pogo. The challenge this week is to win ten 121 point games. I've six so far. I'm better at the game than I thought I would be. I got a badge for that game back in January, but had to go and reread the rules to refresh my memory. I say A. on Pogo too but she wasn't on MSN and so I figured that she didn't want to be disturbed. I'm not sure how she's doing with her pregnancy and her feelings. I never know what to do. I told her if it doesn't go well, we'll scream at the world together. Just raise our heads and cry out at the unfairness. I hope they don't try again though ... it just can't be good on her body. I did our finances today and we're doing pretty ok. I hope it stays that way. If I can manage to keep us on budget until next cycle, then I think we'll have what we need to buy the airconditioner. Thankfully the weather has been ok so far. Even if I had an AC, I wouldn't be using it right now. It's unusually cool for this time of year. I also have to make M. get up on the roof and fix the leak over the back addition. It's leaking pretty badly .. to the point that it worries me when it rains. He should already have all the material he needs. If too much of the drywall has been damaged, then he may need to purchase a few sheets before he's done. We'll see. He assures me that he's got plans for getting it fixed. I think I'm just a worry-wart. urlLink
I was so happy to have my baby home lastnight. After he took a shower, we turned out the lights and just talked for a little bit. We then started kissing and touching each other - but I soon pulled away because he had to be up and read for work in only about 3.5 hours. I don't like the thought of going all day at home knowing that he's dragging butt at work because I kept him up too late. It was really nice to lay together IN THE DARK of the night instead of by the light of day. Tonight I would imagine that we'll go to bed pretty early. Today is Inventory day (D-Day) for him and there is no telling when he'll get home. I'm hoping it'll be around 2 or 3pm. I'd like for us to have dinner together. I'm sure he'll be very happy when this is over. Today is Wednesday and after I finish up here, I will go and see the new challenges on Pogo. I played poker lastnight and was on a winning streak. Which is good because I needed to earn back the $5k I lost earlier in the day. lol. I talked with A. for a little while lastnight on MSN and she was kind of upset ... Seems she was all happy that she hadn't started bleeding at all throughout the day and then when the evening hits, it starts up again. This is the second pregnancy she's had since I've known her and the last one only made it a short time. I wonder when they will decide to stop doing this to her body. It's not healthy and the more it happens, the more likely it's GOING to happen. I just never really realized how difficult it can be to hang on to your pregnancy. I guess I have always taken it for granted. I have no problems staying pregnant and I don't ever have any health issues. I can move around just fine and carry on with life as usual. Except for the mood swings. lol. Anyway, I wish her well - but I'm not going to emotionally invest in this until I know it's going to stick.
My baby is home sweet home! And even EARLY! I put clean sheets and pillow cases on today and it's going to be a VERY good night indeed! No more sleeping alone! I can hardly believe how happy I am. ^_^
M. and I were talking last night about if we thought we would ever do this again with any other friends. Not that we actually have any other friends. We pretty much keep to ourselves. The only other two people that we have associated with are B. (A different one) and A. (a different one) Hmmm ... B - A - B - A ... do you see a pattern here?? Anyway, I felt an attraction to B simply because of his attitude and the fact that he's not ugly. He's stocky sort of with an attitude like he's King Sh*t. It's his confidence that draws me I think. He put out the signals as well by always touching me and calling almost every day. At the time though, we hadn't even considered having sex with our friends. lol. It seemed so outside our thinking. As for A, she's to tiny ... I would be afraid of her getting hurt. lol. Also, she's so small that M would probably be able to do things with her that he can't do with me and that would make me feel bad. At one time I would have been ashamed of that feeling but I've learned that matters of the heart aren't always rational and they don't have to be to be important or justified. M would feel the same way if I did something different with someone else. Aside from all that though I don't think the safety of our current situation could really be duplicated. It has all just fell right into place and things like that are hard to recreate. And maybe down inside, I don't really want to recreate anything??
Whew, I've gotten a lot done today. I'm looking forward to M being off at midnight tonight. No more sleeping alone! I can hardly believe it's been six weeks already. It'll be nice to get back to something normal. Also, we'll be able to have more late nights with B and A. The last two times that we've been together has been really great. There for awhile, I thought that perhaps we were getting board with each other. Or that perhaps M and I were moving on without them. I think in reality though, we were still finding our places with each other. I've often wanted to call my sister and tell her about this whole thing, but I can't think of a way to bring it up on the phone. LOL. It just doesn't seem like something that you would say "hey guess what?" If she ever comes for a visit, I know it'll come up. urlLink Me, B. and A. B has such a cute butt! Cute isn't even the right word. It's just down right sexy ... reminds me of Honeydew Melon. How funny! lol M. has a great butt too. I've always loved it. I'm a Be-Hind person and didn't even know it! Thing is, I felt that A. really started to notice B. rearend after I said something about it a few times. I could be wrong, but one thing this has done for certain, is help us to discover things about our partners that we either never knew or just forgot. This whole experience has really helped me to get in touch with my sexuality, which in turn has built confidence which has made for a better sex life with my husband. I sometimes wonder if it has had the same affect on B. and A.? I would like to hope that they've been able to grow from this ... but I would think that it's a little more difficult for them because they don't live alone. They can't just talk openly like M. and I can. In fact, sometimes when I'm over at their house, I'll say something just like I do here and A. will have to tell me to watch what I say. I just forget so easily. At any rate, I think I look forward to our next meeting. Sometimes I do experience jealousy ... it largely depends on my mood.
We became friends with B and A earlier this year. Once we got to know each other and discovered that we shared a lot of common ground, we began hanging out with each ALL the time. Every waking moment was spent in the company of each other. Fortunately, they have a young daughter that is around the age of our youngest one. It didn't seem that it could be more perfect. B even came over and helped my husband build a new wall in our house to create a third bedroom. So that our girls could have their own room. We ate dinner together, watched movies and were hardly without each other. We got the sense from them that they 'liked' us in a much different way than just friends. After about three weeks of intense friendship, we all decided to watch an adult movie together at our house after the kids went to bed. We did it in our bedroom so that one of the children wouldn't wake up and see something they shouldn't. Anyway, the movie wasn't on more than 20 minutes or so and things started heating up between the couples. To make a very looong story short, we began making out and having sex with our spouses right in front of each other. Then, before I knew it, the husbands were pushing me and A. together and she looked at me and said "aw come on, try something new." So, I did. We kissed and touched each others breasts and then before I knew it, her husband (B.) was kissing me. Then we split off with the other spouse and had sex. Then we all collapsed into a pile and marveled at what we had done. I don't want to give too many details as I'm not sure if it's appropriate here. It was an amazing experience. M and I have been married for 14 years and they have been together for nearly 9 years. We all four come from long term relationships and so to be with another person outside of our marriage was really strange. Especially right there in front of each other! I can tell you this, if you can undress in front of three other people, make out and have sex with all three, it does wonderful things for your self confidence! This happened in Mid-March and here we are at the end of June. We've been together as a foursome every single weekend since then and sometimes once or twice throughout the week as well. It's really been amazing. I've learned a lot and I could have never predicted the impact it would have on my marriage ...
M. (husband) got hom around 8 this morning and will have to go back to work at 3pm, work until midnight, come home and then return at 5am and stay until 'whenever.' Good greif, I'm glad inventory is almost over. This is the last week we'll have to deal with this. Then our lives can get back to somewhat of a normal routine. As for now, I'm going to have to get to the store so that M. can have the car when he wakes up. See ya ...
I can't imagine why I want to post myself out on the internet like this. I've always kept to myself. However, I've had such a remarkable past few months that I'm just screaming to share it with someone. I couldn't possibly tell anyone I know; but, we'll get to that later. At any rate ... Hello World. 12:40pm I thought I'd write a little personal information about myself. I'm 33 and have been married to the same person for 14 years. We fell in love with each other 18 years ago; when we were just fifteen. It's been an amazing ride since. We have two daughters, one is 4 and the other is 12. We finally bought a house a couple of years ago and have been doing repairs on it as we can. We only paid $24K for it. Can you imagine? It needed a new roof though but we did that ourselves for about $800. urlLink I say "ourselves" but my husband did all the work. lol. I just kept the Lemonade flowing. I did help to pick up the shingles though. Boy, what a job that was!
I haven't cried in a long time. A very long time in fact. Matt has given me no reason to. I've come close once, a few weeks ago but I fought it and I won and we worked things out soon after. Tonight though, I lost. I know it's silly but I have had this stupid idea stuck in my head that as long as I don't cry, we're doing ok. We're movng forward and not slipping back any. I've thought that if I cried at all, the delicate layer between our world and all the loneliness and anger of yesterday would be eaten away by the salt in my tears. That my tears would wash away all the happiness that I have felt and that they would be a calling card for the slow decent ...... back. I will close now and finish this tomorrow perhaps. Matt and I are on more stable ground now but I am still fighting those tears. Too many have already fallen for my liking but I could not stop them. I will revisit this later, as I have more to say. (the next day) Things don't seem as bleak today as they did last night. Matt and I were able to get out of the mess last night and go to bed with peace and we awoke holding each other. I'm still not sure what went wrong though. I am inclinded to think that I should have not said anything but that surely WOULD be a step in the wrong direction. I'm just so afraid of being hurt ... Actually, it's not the being hurt that scares me, it's the betrayal that I fear. It wrenches my gut into knots even thinking about such things. *sigh* But that's no way to live and I know that. I trust in Matt and what we build with each other on a daily bases. The funny thing is, even sitting here now, I still feel like crying. Matt is mowing the yard and the girls are doing their own thing. I still feel a heaviness in my chest for some reason. It's the doomed feeling I get when something near me is spinning out of sync. I haven't felt that in a long time and I confess that I haven't missed it one bit. As I've always done when I feel the knocking, I will lay out the whiteboard and wait and see if something comes into focus. I've always hated the waiting more than anything else. EOTSFN
I haven't written in a while ... I've had so much going on it's crazy. I have some very interesting things to tell you but they'll take a back seat for now because something else has brought me here this morning. I dreamed about J. last night. It was him and a friend that I've never met. For some reason I was establishing a relationship with the friend and J was with another girl. We were in a big house by some cliffs surrounded with trees. At one point, I almost slipped off the cliff, but saved myself at the last minute. Then it changes to all of us being inside the house in the living room and the girl J is with is gone. I'm initially sitting with the guy who I think is my new boyfriend, but soon the pull towards J is irrisitable. All through the dream he and I have kept our distance from one another and haven't talked much or interacted in any way, but there has been a heavy tenseness between us. Finally, it's too much for us and we come together in the living room, we kiss lightly at first and then it's like all the walls fall and we emerse ourselves in each other with hurried hunger. We are all over each other and we are at the verge of crying together. It's a painful mix of elation and heavy sadness. Almost a mourning of sorts. We fall back on the couch and strip our clothes and are about to have sex when his girlfriend walks in. She's not happy at all and starts to yell at everyone. My "boyfriend" tells her that she's just got to understand that we (J and I) have to get it out of our systems and reach our closure. Which is weird because secretly J and I knew all day that it would be our last time together. The dream goes on for a few minutes and then just seems to stall. I wake up puzzled as to why I dreamed about him after so many years. My imediate thought is that I've somehow equated something with B to J. Or rather, something about the situation. When I woke up, for the briefest moment, I missed him. I missed the being buried alive feeling we had ... But it passed and I started reflecting on me and M. I have those same feelings with him now and they aren't built inside of a glass house. They are strong and are being sewn into the fibers of our souls. I know that I will ponder this dream all day long, trying to lay out the pieces and see how they fit together. I'm trying to tell me something and I want to hear the messege. I just went back and reread this and perhaps the longing towards being with J is actually reflecting my journey with M. We have opended so many new doors lately and it's things that I have ached over for so long. Perhaps I'm not equating B with J - but M with J. Understand? The almost falling off the cliff is me saving myself in both situations before it goes horribly wrong. The yelling woman is my brain telling me to just STOP IT. lol. And maybe the boyfriend on the couch who would sit quietly by and watch his girlfriend fall into another man is B. He's passive enough for certain. Is it B on the couch watching me and M ... or is M watching me and B? That is almost laughable because I don't have those feelings towards B. The making out with him is nice and I enjoy it, but it doesn't have HUNGER - it doesn't have that "I'm going to die if I don't feed from this person right now" feeling. I think it has to be B on the couch, it's the only thing that makes sense. Maybe the yelling woman is A also .... because I know she is jealous of me. She wants everything I have. Not my things exactly but she wants her life LIKE mine. M just called from work to say Hi and that he loves me. He is amazing. I love him completely.
Fourth of July was really great ... we spent all day at B and A's and I made cherry creamcheese tarts. As requested by A. =-) I think she really likes them. lol. There weren't as many people there as were in invited but it was still a very nice time. Everyone got SO worn out. The guys especially because they always do jumps and things in the pool. Plus, the heat can wear you out as well. I did get a lot of time to talk with A's sister. She had a lot to say about dogs and the different breeds and their care. I am thinking of getting a dog and it was nice to pick her brain for a while. Plus, it helped us to get to know each other. I wonder if A. felt weird about that at all. We had another get together on Saturday night. It was really great actually. I was on my back, B. as near my face, bent down where I could reach 'him' ... M. was going down on me and A. was going down on him. It was really wonderful. At one point, B. pulled himself from me and we were kissing and he was right there in my face while I came from what M. was doing. It was like having something hot and cold at the same time. The temperature not being the focus, but the vast difference between the two. Like night and day. It was the weirdest sensation. M. didn't cum with A., he saved it for me which is a whole OTHER story. He was so wired by the end of the night because he saved himself ... it was an awesome experience. He literally woke up the next morning Withering M. just came to bed and so I need to wrap it up soon. He's sleeping right here beside me. Anyway, it was nice to have them over again. It had been a good two weeks between get togethers. I didn't spend much time with A. that night. I went into this whole thing being very much Bi-Curious. Now I'm totally decided. I LOVE MEN. I have a whole new appreciation for them, the way they look, the way they move .... everything. Speaking of, M. is growing his hair out for me because he says I play with his head much more often than when it was bald. I can't really argue with him there. I love to run my fingers through B.'s hair and I would love to be able to do that with M. as well. B is on vacation all this week and doesn't want to wait until Sunday to get together. I'm thinking of making time for it tomorrow night. Wednesday and Thursday they have company over. Although, today A. started cramping and we think she's losing the baby. If that's the case, I can't imagine her wanting to do anything tomorrow night. After swimming today, I went to their room to get my bra and put it on. A and B were in there and we all three just started getting changed and put together. It was nice to be able to be so comfortable around them to do that, but it was also kind of exciting being in THEIR room. We've never done anything in there. I don't know why I didn't turn and face B. or try to touch him in any way. I guess I was being sensitive to A and her possible loss of the pregnancy. I would have liked to touch at least a little bit, maybe sit on the bed and take him into my mouth for a minute. Wrong timing though I think. Lets see, what else .... Oh, I wrote my Mom today. I haven't heard anything from her since she moved to Tx. Not an email or anything. I do have her new phone number and I was thinkin of calling her. I wrote her today and told her about the updates we've done in the bathroom and how the kids are fairing over the summer. I hope she replys. The bathroom, I painted the tub a deep wine color and M. carpeted the floor. Just those two things make a world of difference! The next thing is putting up a beed-board type stuff and installing the new sink. I'll have to include pictures. I wonder if I have a before picture of the tub. I don't think so, shoot .. I should have taken one. Oh well. Well, I think I'm out of here now. I'll go get something to drink and then head off to bed. It's only 10:20pm but the morning comes early around here. Especially for me. I think once we get the new airconditioner (hopefully this weekend) I can stay up in my recliner while M. goes to bed early. See ya ...
S. (my 12 year old daughter) asked to ride her bike up to the school today to meet one of her friends. I gave her an hour and a half and she just called and asked if her friend can come over and stay for dinner. I said "ok." What continues to amaze me is no matter how many books I stack on her head while she's sleeping, she still continues to grow. (My mother used to say that) She's becoming such a little person ... although not so 'little' anymore. She's wearing bra's and noticing boys and talking on the phone all hours of the day. She'll be starting Junior High this Fall and whether I'm ready for it or not, there are all kinds of new and scary situations just itching to confront us. *gulp* M. is taking a nap right now, he just couldn't make it all the way until bedtime. I guess it's going to take more than one day to get back on our regular schedule. When he gets home tomorrow though, he'll be off for the entire weekend. =-) B and A have invited us over for a Fourth of July cook-out and pool fun on Sunday. Of course we'll go. Also, tomorrow is B's birthday. I couldn't order him what I wanted to because of having to replace the AC in the house. Hmmm .. I'll just have to be creative and give him something *else for his Birthday. *wink. Seriously, a card and peck on the cheek will have to suffice. His vacation starts tomorrow as well. So I'm expecting some late nights for sure this weekend. Although, I think A's brother is in town and if that's the case, then they'll probably stay home. And, I think A. might be having issues with her pregnancy and perhaps not feeling very frisky. We'll see ...
M. went to bed around 9pm ... shortly after the kids. Although I wanted to go with him, I just couldn't sleep that early. I stayed up by myself until about 10pm and then decided to try to get some sleep. I took a shower and lay next to him and held his cock in my hand while I fell asleep. He would stir now and then but never come fully awake. After about an hour, I turned over and he spooned me and held my breasts. He then started playing with my nipples and it felt so wonderful! It just went from there and ended with him being inside of me and me cumming so perfectly. It was a wonderful releases! He came shortly after and we then walked to the kitchen, naked, to get something to drink. I don't know but for some reason that really meant a lot to me. The fact that we didn't split right afterwards. Walking alone with him with nothing on, after pleasing each other so completely, was very touching to me. It's the small things I guess that can sometimes mean the most. And he knew it too, because he pulled me close to him in the living room, standing in darkness, and let me savor the moment just a little longer.
We went to (S)'s orientation for school today. She had a really great time and managed to alleviate all of her fears. lol. She was worried about 'this' or 'that' and I told her it would all work out and she would see that Junior High isn't as complicated as it seems. She's very happy and that of course makes ME happy. =-) I was playing Canasta with A. last night and I reminded her that she said she'd watch (T). for me tomorrow while I took (S) to school. She gave me this long pause and said "well, ummm ... how later? Mom is off tomorrow and I'll .... umm .. have to see if it's ... umm, ok with her." She didn't actually say it that way in the chat, but that's how she made me feel. She didn't just say "ok" like she did originally. She then called me this morning and told me that it would be fine with her Mother to bring her over this evening. And that I shouldn't forget to feed her before we come over or to at least bring some dinner with me for her. My first thought was how many times they have eaten here without any forethought and how often I feed their child without thinking about it. I don't know, the whole thing just seemed weird to me and I got a funny feeling. Later in the day, (B) asked to come over on the way to the store. Once they got there, she seemed in a bit of a hurry to leave. Especially when (B) moved to sit next to me. I'm not 'saying' anything really ... just that it felt weird ... different than it has ever before. Also, the other day I told her about how I thought that (B) does a really cool thing with his hands when we're having sex. I couldn't really explain it very well, other than to say that I just liked it. He even asked me later what it was exactly because he really had no idea he was doing anything special at all. Well, since then ... (A) has called him "magic fingers" around me. She goes ON and ON and ON about what wonderful fingers he has. I just find it funny. It's like the butt thing, she doesn't notice it at all until I make a comment about something. I think in reality she knows she'll never be me or have what I have and so she tries to make me jealous of the things SHE has. It's weird .. and I'm saying that word a lot tonight. lol And by the way, I took (T) with me to school. Bev came over several times today and guess what I notice? She's flirting with me. I don't think it would ever go anywhere .... not like at the yard party but I think she is intrigued by what happened and likes to have that open relationship with me. She likes being a little bit flirty with another female. It's totally fine by me because she's a good person inside and I like spending time with her. We have a lot of fun together. It's funny ... she's less attractive than (A) in the face, but her personality goes W A Y beyond that of (A) and that makes her MORE attractive in the end. Maybe there IS something to that whole thing about "it's what's on the inside that counts". I called (M) at the Hotel this evening. He seemed happy to hear from me. He said he's been working hard and being good. He said that he's going to go have a beer tonight and that made my stomach clentch a little bit. There is an ever present small fear that I'm stupid and don't see what is really going on sometimes. I fear that I have closed off my 'receptors' and am no longer willing to see anything outside of my perfect little bubble. It's not a big fear though. I mostly think it's just the fear of totally letting go and having pure Faith in someone. If I am ever to achieve that, I wish it to be with (M). He is my everything and we are headed for wondrous times. I will tell you this, it's been nice to sit at home after it's dark and the world is settling in for the night and not feel a darkness in my center. To not feel like there is something terribly wrong. He should be home tomorrow afternoon. Let's hope. Last night when I went to bed, I was a little frightened by all the noise in the house. I had to lay there for a bit with the light on because I was too scared to turn it off. I thought about the fact that I could call (B) and ask him to just come and lay with me so I'd feel safer. Not touch me in any way or snuggle, but just to be in the same room. I didn't think of (M) because he's so far away and it's not possible for him to be here. The thought of (B) though and that I COULD have him come over, made me feel better. It actually helped me to go to sleep. I don't want (M) to think that I was choosing (B) over him, it's just that the possibility was what made me feel better, not actually the person. I talked with my Mom today. I almost told her about my hair, but I had company coming in and out and didn't want to distract from the conversation once I told her. I think I'll take some pictures and send them while I tell her all about it. That will be fun! She's doing fine I guess. She said that Daddy will probably have to have surgery soon on his neck. He has some bone spurs that are getting bad and keeping him from being able to turn his head. I hate the thought of my parents winding down. Tick-Tock-Tick ........ Tock. I saw something on (M)'s computer that bothered me a little. I was writing emails and thinking of sending my sister some more pictures and I thought about Amy and that I should write her. So I got on (M)'s computer to get the address and I see that he has signed some of his letters to her as "Kazs" or something like that. I can't remember exactly. The thing that I guess that bothered me was the casualness of the signature and the fact that I had never heard him refer to himself in that way. I felt like it was a small secret thing between them that I'm not part of. It just made me feel weird. And, I'm not totally convinced that he would be faithful to me under the wrong circumstances. See how I am? Ok, just stop-it. I'm not even going to go there. I trust him and have faith. Especially after all that we have learned in the past few months. We are so different than we have ever been. I love him. Ok, I warned you that I would write a lot this week. What else is there to do when the only thing keeping me company are the voices in my head? It's 10:30 now and perhaps I'll go play some games on Pogo. See ya ....
Ok, so Tay comes over today and asks to charge a cell phone, because you guessed it, their power got cut off. So no problem, we find a plugin and she's on her way for an hour. Later in the day though she comes over with what looks like a hotpocket or something and asks to heat it in the microwave. I pause but then relent. On her way out, she asks to borrow the plate it's heated on and I say "ok, just bring it by later sometime." Well, time goes by and the night is coming and I figure I have to do some legbreaking to get my plate back. I see Tay and her Mom pulling up in the driveway and ask Sarah to go ask about the darn plate. Tays Mom flipped out! She started cussing at Tay about "we don't need their shit! We got our OWN shit! What were you f*cking thinking?!" She goes off on Tay so hard it makes her cry. So what does she do?? She makes Tay go get my plate AND one of theirs to give to me. Ok, lets think about this ... .... .... .... .... nope, I just can't see where that makes any damn sense at all. lol. I just stood their looking at this plate that is from another house and wondered what the hell do I do with it?? I mean, how is that a lesson of any kind? So, I now have this strange orphand plate that seems like it's from another universe. I've been obsessing about the plate all day long. lol. It doesn't go anywhere and I don't even like where it came from. So, like, what do I DO with it?? I'm thinking perhaps I'll paint on it and hang it on my door. It'll say "next time, bring a bowl."
Don't know why but something is trying to take up residence in the house. It's been coming and going for the past week and it's getting more intense. Whatever it is, it's pretty straight forward. It uses what it knows and makes it's self known for some reason. I don't know if it's good or bad yet; it just kind of freaks me out when it makes things move. It stays around me when it's active ... if it does something tonight I'm going to start asking questions. Funny thing though, I've had my mirror out less than a month and now I've snagged something. Good point self ... I think I'll be putting the mirror in it's cloth tonight before bed and see if that helps. It doesn't help that I've gazed into it several times lately without cleaning it first. Bad form ...
Matt left this afternoon for Harrison. He has to go help a store that is opening in three days. He and the store manager from here and one other employee are going. He will be gone until Wednesday night. Today is Sunday night. ** He just called and checked in with me. I love that he did that. He wasn't all lovey-dovey because he was borrowing his bosses cell phone. They are going to go down to the pool that the hotel has. Man, I feel lonely and it's only the first night. *sigh Anyway, I know that there is no reason to worry. Everything seems to be on the up and up this time. I hope it stays that way. I can't imagine having to worry like I did last time he went out of town. It sucked really badly. Mostly, I'm just bored. B. IM'ed me earlier and asked me if I was getting close to my period. I thought that an odd question from him. Apparently, A. started today and she is "laying wagers that I start today or tomorrow." Good Lord. I asked B. why he asked me that and he said that A. told him that my nipples were tender. The truth of the matter is, I just didn't want her touching me there lastnight, so I feined being a little sore. She's too pushy and touches me like a guy would. An uneducated one at that. lol. She's got little tact or idea about how a woman likes to be touched. At least me anyway. Who can say about others. Anyway, it was funny. I told B. that I was tender from the nipple clamps ... lol. I just didn't want her touching me. I'm going to HAVE to find a way to tell her that I'm not interested in her. Preferably before we go to see SlowVein this month. Like Matt said, "I'm going to see a show, not BE the show." I miss him already. This sucks. But I'm glad he gets to go and get out of town for a bit. I know he loves opening new stores. Oh well, perhaps I'll go play some Pogo. I have a feeling that I will write quite a bit in the next few days. ttul.
Donya had me and some friends over for a dinner party. It was a bit of a house warming. Unfortunately she didn't have enough chairs, so I had to lend her the chairs in my bedroom. So here I am, typing on my knees. I went to Sylvian's house the other night. We watched a movie. Well, it would be considered an honor to call the Truth About Charlie a movie. This movie was horrible! Sometimes bad movies are the best mentors. They enable you to clearly identify what you dislike, and what you consider to be poor filmmaking. Sometimes we learn more from these examples. Even when I watch a bad movie, I try to find something of interest. Sylvain was so pissed that Hollywood's depiction of France included old cars. "we haven't had cars like that in the past ten years," he exclaimed. Sylvain couldn't get over the cliche depictions of American France. I posed the following as an answer and refute to his statement. I don't hold too many expectations of the American public. Especially when it comes to films. I told Sylvania that had the classic old French cars and cliche idiosyncrasies not been presented, that the American public would forget what city we were in. That's literally how bad it is. We are told what to believe and how to feel. Editing, music, mise en scene force us to feel the way a director chooses. This power is something I admire and idealize, but it becomes interesting when it crosses cultural boundaries. We have to trick our own audiences by giving them stock resemblances of a lifestyle that we can only imagine through the eloquence of film. Its fake, and it's real to us all at the same time. We know what we are watching, and we are told how to feel. What an incredible art form.
If I knew the actual title of this film I would have written it. I don't though. I would like to start this post by pointing out how excited I am that the last post inspired so much discourse. I can only hope for the same kind of attention in future posts. Despite what you might think, I don't go to the movies that often. There is never really anything that I want to see. In a state of depression, I tagged along with my friends to see Harry Potter 3 (HP3). During one of the previews I remember leaning over to my friend Monica and saying, "I think I'm going to change my career." It's frustrating as a filmmaker to see previews for what I consider to be crap and realize that these are the kinds of films that get funding. I was worried as to what the film itself would be like. I'm not much of a Harry Potter fan. I can only hope that my films will one day inspire the kind of loyalty in that of a Harry Potter fan. As far as the film goes, I could care less. I'm told that the books are great. I'm told that if I read the books I'll love the films. In my opinion, a film should stand on it's own. You shouldn't have to bring anything with you, like already reading the book. There are no prerequisites in movie watching. Harry Potter 3 does seem to stand on its own; it's just not my kind of movie. I've never made it through the first two Harry Potter movies. I fall asleep midway every time. I made it through Harry Potter 3, so it must be the best film of the three. I suppose what I am really trying to say about this film is that my opinion is indifferent. If you're into the books and the first two movies, you're going to like the film. So go and see it if you haven't. If you're among the 1% of American's like me who could care less, then rent Sunset Blvd. You'll be much happier and have the luxury of seeing the old lady who threw the heart of the ocean overboard when she was 40. "The china had never been used, the sheets had never been slept in, Titanic was called the ship of dreams, and it was, it really was." I have no idea where that came from. Back to Potter. Even when I see a bad movie I manage to come back with something that I liked. HP3 is not a bad movie. It's just not for me. It's very standard, which is fine. The audience is not there for symbolic imagery or theoretical editing. You're there to see your book come alive, and I'm told the film does a great job at that. What I find to be the films best feature is Act 3. The entire resolution comes via time travel. Now I would normally say that the screenwriter painted himself in a corner and came up with time travel as a way to get out, but I'm letting it go because it was so well written. I've been obsessed with time travel ever since Back to the Future. I tried to remake the film with a time traveling bike in sixth grade. The footage was sadly lost. The way HP3 was different was that before the time traveling occurred several events took place that were a bit odd, all of which were explained when the characters went back in time. For example, Harry and that sick girl hear a noise from the forest... later we find that it was them traveling back in time looking on themselves. Did that make sense? I don't really know how to write this for it to make sense so you may have to watch the movie to know what I'm talking about. It was very cool though. They really drove it home with a ticking clock in the score and images of clocks throughout the entire movie. This is a bit obvious for the average viewer but is quite satisfying to find. Do I recommend the film... sure. If you have seen one and two, then you are going to see three. That's the way it works. You will most likely love it. If you haven't seen any of the films, then I wouldn't bother. While the film has three distinct acts, it is very episodic. Every film has the same plot line. The kids go back to school and have to overcome something using their magic and Harry always saves the day. My question to you is how many times you will buy this plot line with different actions substituted? Did you like the film? Why? Has anyone seen all the films but not read the books?
I had my gay friends over last night to watch a movie. Most of the night was spent talking, catching up, and comparing Toby to the gangly character in All Over The Guy . This is a movie that I really like. It's a gay romantic comedy that lends itself to clever wittacisims and smart dialog. When the movie is funny, it's really funny. But when the movie is cheesy, it's almost painful. In this respect it really is just like any other romantic comedy but with gay characters. Did the boys like it? Not really. Sylvain moaned and said, "when is it going to be over?" Jared was counting down the minutes. Toby and I found it romantic when one character made breakfast in bed for the other, while the other boys proclaimed that they would run out of the room if a guy ever did that for them. It's interesting to me to see this kind of perspective. Identity is so important in cinema. It's how we relate to the film. It's what keeps us there for two hours. In the case of standard Hollywood movies, especially in the case of romantic comedies, us gay folk, have to assimilate the roles of the straight couple being depicted on screen. This is something that doesn't usually cross the mind of the average straight white person because they have never had to assimilate to any Hollywood film. For a gay male, or female for that matter, we have to pick one of the characters in the romantic comedy, the one with which we most identify, and assimilate their feelings and perspectives. Something to think about. So wouldn't tou think that five gay guys watching a gay romantic comedy would be pleased? Chris said, "it's gay so we almost have to like it." But most of the boys did not like it. They just thought it was a bad movie. I happen to really like the film. I own it. Perhaps we have become so accustomed to assimilation that we are somehow removed from the gay characters. We picked them apart and laughed at them, instead of with them. I find this paradox very interesting. So would I recommend the film? Well, before last night I would have. :-) I still think the film is worth a watch. Most of my straight friends who saw the film seemed to really like it. That could have been a rouse in an effort to support me, but hopefully it was not. After my experience last night, I'm more interested in the straight assimilation of the film. I'm curious to know how a straight audience would view the film. Would they think it bad as well? Would they like it because they feel like they are supporting a cause? Or would they set aside the cliche attitudes of popular American culture and isolate the story for what it actually is? In reality, most romantic comedies are cheesy. The chick flic, or the weapies as they used to be called, are sometimes painful to watch because they push the cheese factor. Usually they have their strong points, and we all hope for the idealism they portray in our own relationships, but have yet to find. If you know what the film is, you can really enjoy it. You can't go to see How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days and expect to come out talking about Oscar. But if you know what the film is, you may actually like it. The same is true for this film. I could go on about this some more but I won't. I don't feel as if I've even made a point yet, but I wanted to offer some perspective. If this is the kind of movie you are in the mood for then it is certainly worth a watch, otherwise, you may want to pick something else.

It's nice to have somewhere to place your thoughts where others might be inspired to comment. It gives you a sort of journalistic feel, while at the same time allowing the public to either make retractions for you, or embellish your thoughts. The most fulfilling aspect is when a comment perpetuates an idea and gives you the freedom to go somewhere you hadn't anticipated going. This is the first, of hopefully many blog postings on foppish films. While the site is still not fully functional, I think it is important to have a forum where people can see what foppish films is all about, directly from its creator. So I suppose this is an informal mission statement. I hope to give you insight on current films, as well as foppish films. I hope that you can introduce me to new film ideas as well as your insight to films that you watch and admire. Until next time...
This post is going to be long. Just to warn you.
Did I ever tell you about the time when David Copperfield made me disappear live on stage at Caesar’s Palace in Tahoe? I was just on the phone with my friend Donya, and I don’t know what made me think of it but somehow the topic came up. Donya is still bitter because I haven’t told her how the trick actually worked. If you are only reading on because you think that I am going to disclose that information then don’t bother. I haven’t told anyone, not even my mother. Well, I guess there are a few things I could tell my mother about certain other magic tricks that I like to perform but this is the wrong forum for that. When I was a kid, David Copperfield was my idol. He wore tight black pants, trendy velcro shoes, and shirts that revealed his chest. On top of that he would dance provocatively with gorgeous women and then make them disappear, or cut them in half. I too wanted to be a magician, but thought the likelihood of me actually finding work was slim. I found filmmaking instead. Filmmaking is magic, and most of the time people just watch and enjoy instead of constantly trying to figure out the trick. Furthermore, I often find myself dancing with gorgeous women on stages and wearing tight pants. So I suppose I got the best of both worlds!
Sound had once been said to be the downfall of cinema. A once mobile camera was now limited by cumbersome sound recording equipment. Technology has drastically improved over the years and sound has become imperative. I mention all of this because I recently watched Fahrenheit 9/11. Early on in the film there is a brilliant use of sound. The scene is of the planes crashing into the twin towers on the morning of September 11th. Michael more, chose do leave the screen black and just play the sound. The theater shook as each plane hit. You could hear people screaming and the event suddenly became more real than if I had seen it. Sometimes imagination is our best visual aide. This was such an interesting time for our country and the event really hits home to all of us. I found myself crying as the following shot was of a grey city in a rainfall of ash. People screaming for their loved one who were now gone. This is a really liberal film. I know there are a bunch of people who won’t see the movie specifically because of this, but it’s well worth the watch. While most of the film is light hearted and comical, there are many parts that left me wiping the tears from my face. This movie inspires a range of emotion that I have not seen in a long time. Michael Moore really outdid himself with this film. This is one of the best movies I have seen this year. I highly recommend it, no mater where your political beliefs lie.
Two of my friends Jondi and Spesh just released their new album with great success. One journalist, however, didn't care for the album. Please visit this link to read his article. http://www.sfweekly.com/issues/current/garrett.html Then you can read the following e-mail which I sent to the journalist. See below. Dear Mr. Kamps, I recently noticed an article of yours in SF Weekly entitled "Party like it's 1999." I read the article and couldn't help but feel offended. The article evoked such a mean spirited feeling I felt it necessary respond. I hope my retort carries the same cynicism as your article as I try effortlessly to emulate your "style." "Maybe it's the mix of beer and Red Bull in my system, but I am finding it hard to be cynical on a recent Wednesday evening at the Virgin Megastore on Market Street, where local DJ's/producers/label owners Jondi and Spesh are celebrating the release of their third full-length, The Answer." I had trouble getting past your first sentence. I'm not familiar with your column which I think suggests something about your fan base, but for some reason you feel the need to make the comment, "there's a generous helping of fans, maybe three dozen or so, and their exuberance makes up for the low turnout." I'm trying to figure out what your column is about. Are you a music critic? In your first line you mention that you are "finding it hard to be cynical," so it seems more like your column is about poking fun at people. Is this the case? In order for me to take you seriously then I am curious to know wherein your credentials lie. Are you a dj? Do you spin? I myself am a filmmaker. I'm sure you are aware that film critics are well studied, if not filmmakers themselves, they therefore have the intelligence to critique others work. By this notion I assume you are a dj, and have created music of your own. If not, I find it hard to swallow that you are so quick to make outlandish claims about Jondi and Spesh's new album. Therefore, if you are not a dj, or cannot make music of your own, then your article is based solely on opinion and not a critical analysis at all. I just want to be sure. I assume, and only feel that I have the right to do so as you have done in your article, that you are a journalist. So you must be well studied in journalism and the ethical treatment of free speech. You've probably taken more classes than you ever wanted to on the subject. If that's the case, then I find it odd that you have such an easy time quoting people out of context. Isn't that a journalist rule? I'm not well studied in journalism, so I really can't say. I'm not familiar with the journalistic code, but I am sure that it is broken all the time. I wouldn't bother then by holding yourself to it. If you have not studied journalism, then again I'm curious to know where your credentials lie. Based on the two inferences that I have made I still can't comprehend what your column is about. If your not a critic, or an ethical journalist, then how is it that you are able to have your own column in SF Weekly? Is this just an opinion column, by an unknown, self appointed opinion maker? It must be. I'll continue then, knowing that is where your credentials lie. Your next attack seems to be on your unflattering description of the fans. What did they do to deserve such treatment? I would love to see what your fans look like. Do they look like you? I'm not sure what you look like but if you have to hide behind written word maybe you're not so easy on the eyes. Do your fans wear stickers on their back that read, "We Love Garrett?" I doubt it. Would you reach for one of those? It appears that most of your reaching is done in the gross generalizations that you make about the crowd, the album, qool culture, and it's creators. Do you pat yourself on the back for that? Perhaps this hits home for me as I was wearing one of those stickers. But maybe I shouldn't take that personally, you must not have been referring to me since "no one at 'Qool' looks younger than 25." I'm only 23, so you couldn't have been talking about me, or a good helping of my peers for that matter. We're you welcomed when you floated up the escalator? Jondi explains the concept behind the new album and you state, "it was a bad idea." This is, obviously opinion, unless you have electronic musical experience of your own. I can respect any opinion you may have of the cd but what I cannot entertain is your arrogance in telling someone that their idea is "bad." What are your ideas? Are they good? They must be fantastic. What are they about? You intrigue me. What is it you create that gives you the right to make claims about ideas being good or bad? When you studied at the school of creativity did they educate you on what equates a good idea and what constitutes a bad one? Please let me know where you received your degree in creativity because I would love one. I have found from my education in film that creativity cannot be taught. It is something that comes from within. Something that can be measured, if you like, by success. You write an article about a two people who have seen great success in their creativity. If you don't mind, I'll trust their opinion on what is a good idea over yours, unless you can provide me with a list of your creative endeavors that have been received with more success. You continue to perpetuate your judgment of the album by juxtaposing a quote from Jondi with your closing line. "God, I'd have to say that since I'm so musically ignorant -- I didn't have years of training -- it's always fascinating to me. I'll never be able to become cynical about music, because I just don't know enough. I'm constantly surprised by what happens with sounds and notes and melodies and harmonies. Maybe it's because I'm not sophisticated." You then write, "The Answer, indeed." This is perhaps the most offensive part of your opinion column. Perhaps you have an issue with the fact that Jondi will "never be able to become cynical." Maybe that is what hits home for you as your column is based entirely off cynicism. Have you received many responses from this article? An article like this seems to inspire nothing but aggravated fans who send you hate mail in response to your bold claims. You are the meter maid of journalism. But I guess you have a job to do. Sincerely, Michael S. Harris p.s. I will be posting my response to your article on my blog. Feel free to check it out, I welcome your comments and ideas, even if they are "bad." www.foppishfilms.com/blog.htm
Does film imitate life, or does life imitate film? The topic is highly debated. I find that my life is a movie. It's just on going, and you don't know how the end will be. I have a weird feeling that when my life has ended it will have the ability to be broken into a three-act structure. Furthermore, I consider all of my downfalls, not only learning experiences, but installments in my E True Hollywood Story. People like myself have to plan for such events. So if life is but a play and all the people merely players, then we are constantly having new characters come in and out of the scenes of our lives. In the past few weeks a new character entered my film. INT. ANDREW’S HOUSE - NIGHT A tall and slender AARON GREEN sits on a chair across from Michael. Michael had previously heard about Aaron but they had never met. Actually, Michael had no idea that the person sitting in front of him was Aaron. Dissolve to: I find it interesting how quickly people can become connected. Sometimes friendship takes a lot of work and sometimes they just work by themselves. Both are rewarding in different ways. Aaron is similar to me, most likely why we get along. Most likely why he asked that I write about him in my blog. I'm sure that if he reads this he'll be moved, if not, I was bored anyway. Aaron and I were supposed to watch Barbershop tonight at his house but time slipped away and I don't feel like riding the bus all over town, so we rescheduled. Instead, I called Gunita and asked her to listen to Celine Dion and make sweet love to me. She declined. I’ve come to terms with the fact that I may have to check Gunita into a home soon. Gunita and I spend all of our lunches together. We recently spent a day with our friends Martin and Chris celebrating their son Sebastian's second birthday. What a fantastic day! On the way home, during a period of silence, I explained to Gunita that you know you have a good friendship when you can sit with a friend in silence and not feel uncomfortable, especially on car rides. On road trips people seem to have conversation for a while and then have a long period of silence to reflect or think about other things. Then the conversation picks back up again. Our lunches are like this. We were eating at one of the design centers by our work, a place that looked like a hospital. Gunita and I were not talking, experiencing a comfortable silence, when I noticed a large glob of Dijon trying to become an icicle on the tip of her chin. I took my napkin and wiped it off calling her a senior citizen. We laughed uncontrollably, and then returned to silence. If these comfortable periods of silence become too long, I may have to check her into a home. Here she'll have the luxury of spontaneous exercise in front of vending machines whenever she chooses. That lunch with Gunita was just once scene. Some scenes are worth remembering and some end up on the editing floor. We take the good scenes with us, and leave the bad ones behind. Sometimes we take the bad ones, but it's important to remember that only so much can be done in editing. Sometimes, we need to make the edit and move on.
I've been getting a lot of flack from people because I haven't made a posting in a while. What's that all about? Here I thought no one even read this damn thing because my last posting, which was in my opinion hysterical, received only one comment. Apparently there are loads of opinionless people reading my blog so I need fulfill my commitment and write about something. I like to keep my postings about films as this is a film website but sometimes I need to post about life. This is where I vent, and where I breath. So here goes. I have watched a few movies lately. I've been trying to lead a more low key lifestyle so I have been watching a lot of movies. Last Friday night I watched Life as a House. I love this movie, but it's sad, so if you don't like sad movies, I wouldn't recommend this one. Then on Sunday I watched Welcome to the Dollhouse, another funny movie. This movie is amusing but I don't feel like the main character has that much of a character arch which leaves you feeling pretty much the same at the end of the film as you felt when you started the movie. I don't really like that, I like to feel differently after watching a movie. I usually sit down to watch a movie for a reason, and this movie doesn't seem to have much reason. On Monday I watched Amalie. This movie is spectacular. If you haven't seen it then you really need to get on it! Then on Tuesday I watched Misery. This chilling film still gets to me and I have seen it so many times. Very good, but it's a bit twisted so if you can't handle that sort of thing, I wouldn't watch this one. That pretty much it for movie stuff. As for life... well that a whole other posting. I went to 111 Minna last night and hung out for a while. I think it was Beth who said she could write a book about that place. I think someone should. Or at least make a pilot for a sitcom. Beth and I amused ourselves by playing the straight game. That's basically where I try to pretend that I'm straight. I can't talk, cause that ruins it, so really it's a sort of stance that I was working on. Every time Jackie looked over I was trying to check her out. The illusion was ruined quickly because every time I would get my stance convincing enough I would laugh, clap my hands a lot, and jump up and down. I suppose that's not really a straight male quality but it certainly gave us a hearty chuckle. By the end of the night Jackie was checking me out. She was moist. I know it. Maybe I need to make a film about life in San Francisco. A movie about me and all of my hopelessly single friends. None of us can figure out why we are single especially considering we always seem to have the answers to all couples problems. Are we too smart to get into a relationship. Obviously with the knowledge that we already have our relationships would be very successful. They would be like power relationships. We would all attend couples parties and couples dinners and answer for each other. This posting has really taken a turn for the worse so I'm going to stop. Screw it. Stop reading if you're bored, I'm going to keep going. The week before at minna we were talking about how guys try to remove a wedgie. Imagine, if you will, that a man is walking down the street. Then, an uncomfortable sensation begins to grab at his under carriage. A situation that could be easily resolved by placing your hand at the base of your jeans and tugging downward, is over powered by public embarrassment. Instead, the better option seems to, in mid stride, bow your legs out as if you just got off a horse. This movement opens the butt cheeks and releases that caught material that has caused the undesirable sensation. Once released, normal walking resumes and the wedgie is just a thing of the past. Ridiculous how this walk makes us laugh so hard. We walk around Minna trying to perfect it. People who don't know us must assume that we all have some sort of disorder that prevents us from walking like normal people. Yeah, sure, we're the weird ones. So I saw this guy at the bank, and he was at the teller window, and he did the wedgie release, but while he was standing still. Can you imagine? I look over and the man lifts his right leg in the air out from his side and makes a motion like he is doing the breast stroke upright and out of water. Good thing he choose that option. You wouldn't want the teller to see you pick your wedgie. That would be embarrassing. The smarter option is to let a line of waiting people watch this little indulgence that I consider social suicide. I laughed out loud. Laughing out loud is one of my most favorite things, when you are by yourself and you see something so funny that you can't help but laugh out loud. Everyone around you will assume that you're some sort of crazy person. And only you will know what is so funny. These are little games that we can play with ourselves to keep entertained. Try it sometime. I promise, you won't be disappointed. After Minna I foolishly attempted to go to Anu. Why? Everytime I go there Gunita manages to make me stay while she mingles and I try to figure out where I am. "Michael, come with me, we are going to take Cece home." What? I'm in the car on the way to Milbrae. What the hell is Milbrae? I have no idea, but it's nearly midnight and I'm there. Gunita's sharp driving skills left us circling the domestic terminal at the airport. Do I have to check bags in the United terminal to get back to Anu? I'm confused. Suddenly we were on luxurious 6th street homeward bound. I was back in the bar before I knew it trying to figure out where I was. Jeffrey Allen came over and said, "are you ok? SMILE." Was I not smiling? I had no idea. I think people are used to me smiling because on the rare chance when I am not smiling, eight million people have to ask me who died, or what's wrong. That's annoying, isn't it Jackie? Ok, someone give me a topic and I'll tell you what I think.
I've decided to give a little insight to where the term jesus juice came from. So I'm watching tv one night i think it was E news or something and this woman who works for vogue magazine starts to talk about her article she wrote about Michael Jackson's life and the new sex scandal. Im intrigued and my eyes are glued to the tv, she starts to talk about Michael's private jet and how he takes groups of kids on trips to god knows where, anyway she starts to say Michael likes to get his kiddie companions all liquored up with something he calls "Jesus Juice". Once i heard this name i was hooked. Michael apparently likes to fill empty cans of soda with wine coolers and wine, then he hands it to the kids claiming its juice from jesus and they should feel honored to be given such a treat. I dont know about you but i would feel pretty fuckin honored at nine years old to be given such a holy opportunity. lol. Even if this claim is untrue, i love its brilliance, the name just rolls off the tongue. Today wasn't too bad. Actually made it to the gym and I didn't run into chester the molester (will explain on next blog) Decided at work today that we should have a wall of dwarfs playing orchestra on square cut outs in our wall, such a great visual lol. I'm still trying to find one to pose as my pet for an undisclosed amount of money hehe. Today's word of the day is ignorant, or as some folk say ignent lol, you know who you are! btw, why do they keep giving Halle Berry work? Grrrrr Listening to: Beth Orton - thinking about tomorrow
I am not a writer nor claim to be. I came upon this site aimlessly weeding through friendster, sad i know. After laughing my ass off reading some of the blogs ( where did this name originate from?) posted i've decided to start my own, seems harmless enough. I guess i'll start with my day. I woke up around 8am in hopes i might drag my sorry ass to the gym but after lying in bed for 45 minutes weighing the pros and cons of this venture i decided to let laziness win. Instead i decided to go to a 10:45am showing of "saved". There is something eerily comforting going to the movies by yourself, hmmmmm that sounds really sad hehe oh well. I have this strange obsession with Mandy Moore, i dont know what it is and i refuse to think to much about it, because in doing so i will end up questioning my gayness and thats a whole other blog. I left "Saved" feeling uplifted and truly in need of finding a religion of my own. After a 20 minute ride on the red line and 30 minute masterbating session ive come to the conclusion this religion suites me just fine. I listened to fnx for the first time in about a year and realized why i stopped listening in the first place. I live with two girls in cambridge the situation is very Threes Company. One of my roommies came home today with an interesting reason why she's been MIA all weekend. I'll start with the back ground info. Big B (my new name for her for this blog) has been cheating on her bf for three months now with this guy from Iran. Big B broke it off with her bf about a week ago, with all this new found single time on her hands Big B naturally started taking the I-Sore (new name for Iranian man for blog) to the next level. Spending as much time as she can with him since she will be leaving for the summer in a week. She comes home today and tells my other roommie and me she was supposed to see him on Saturday night but he blew her off text message stating he had an issue to deal with and an apology. Yesterday while on the high way she answers her cell to a woman asking where I-Sore is, the phone call breaks up and Big B is left with no explanation of who this female stranger is. Later that day Big B gets a phone call from I-Sore stating he has some confessions to make, the following are these confessions, 1) He is 38 not 28 2) He's married not Single 3) Has three kids 9mos, 4, 5 (i think those are the ages) 4) Wants a seperation from his wife 5) Has had 2 previous girlfriends before Big B The moral: If Big B had only turned to Jesus none of this would have happened. Till Tuesday. Listening to - Modest Mouse "float on"
im working on my first iced coffee at 9:15pm and i think its a gonna be along night. ive had a headache all day and i believe its due to the lack of coffee intake. i told myself id write about chester the molester but i really dont feel like it. im contemplating moving to the cali and i keep going over the pros and cons. its a big leap. one ive been ready for a while now. financialy im not in the position to take on this venture. the job i have now does not pay nearly as much as it should. i can get another suck ass job that will 1) stress me the fuck out 2) leave me no time to touch myself in the way im accustomed to. so my only option is to sell my body on the side, hehehe. so now im thinking ill suck it up get another job save up some dough and get the fuck out of Mass. im 25, single, in a dead end job, shit pay, living off ramen, nows the time to move on:) My other roomie big b has flown the nest and her two month replacement moves in today, he seems like a cool guy so far, i was scoping out the luggage and he's packing a guitar at least i think its a guitar, it could very well be a machine gun. hopefully he does drugs and knows how to share. im watching reality bites and im finding freaky simalarities to my life. tomorrow will be job hunting day and im dreading every moment all ready, not sure if i should start on a friday though.
urlLink i'm thirsty! urlLink what is that?!?! a push pin slammed into the back of a bottle of "beer"? i wish so bad that i could go to the store and find a case of "beer" brand beer. Did You Know ? even complete strangers can comment on my blog!
urlLink yep urlLink there's this new science i'm really interested in! it's called "propaganda". i'm learning all about it from my friend michael moore and joe goebbels
urlLink sscultpture urlLink i went to santa barbara about a month ago and came across this guy as i was leaving. he was really nice and let me take some pix of his sand sculptures, so i floated him some cash. he told me about how he was in vietnam and why he won't show his art in galleries. it was sad and and inspiring.
urlLink ;) urlLink do you enjoy an active lifestyle? are you always "on the go"? do your teeth look like a mummy's cos you drink coffee "all day"? hi. my name is jason. i've tried several teeth whitening products, and the only one i endorse with my whole body is colgate "simply white". it's only ten bucks, and you can slather it on whenever you want without hassle. no crazy ass tapes or denture-like apliances, hoses, pulleys, cogs, servos or any simples machines. it's not too bad if you ask me.
urlLink tat urlLink i don't understand this "hello" program. crap!!!
urlLink ... urlLink i have a lot of hobbies. my most recent hobby is animal pediatrics. i gave a water turtle an intraveneous injection today and it was awesome. it bit me 17 times. i have a video of the procedure, but there's a lot of profanity involved. it really hurts when they bite you. while i was shooting this jerk up, i was considering learning taxidermy in case i messed up. i like to cover my bases. is it wrong that i make myself laugh ? an ex- girlfriend said "yes" i bet you guys think i dislike dan. he's alright. he has a really great body, he drives a monster truck and he throws a baseball like a girl, which amuses me immensely! i just bought "goodfellas"- the new one, with the extra crap, and i just can't help but feeling that it's the most overrated movie ever next to fargo. "mean streets" is far better IMO. NOUNS I MISS: *wailing on my bass hard with sam. *enjoying video games like i was 6 *rodney harrison * vanessa kahner *lucid dreaming( i haven't had one in months!) *paxil * chicken and waffles * greatest dog *lithium(every once in awhile. if you take it on a plane you'll feel like ants are eating yr intestines, which is semi-awesome!) *people i love
urlLink wanted urlLink if you see a datsun like this one, i will buy it! the one i doodled is really this color , which is gross. if you are interested in ninjas, robert hamburger's book, "real ultimate power: the official ninja book" will change your life. more later. it's too early for this crap.
That song was played through our cart today lol, as well as a good amountitude of patriotage buuuddy. I have yet to eat or drink today so I am on a second wind and sort of hyper. I woke up with an attitude that reminded me of my english teacher this morning. "I do not know how much I could ever trust a thing that bleeds nearly immensely for several days straight and does not die..." -James Francoeur in regards to females...yes...my english teacher said this to our class. I do not know where he got it from, but it came to mind and got me to laugh a bit this morning. Now that you are a bit freaked out...the parades went well and once more Engineer Dave teased me about being the only female. The candy cannon worked well too. It allowed us to demonstrate that there are two different forms of "Ah" There is the one which is amazed, such as: Ohhh, Ahhh, look at the fireworks! And there is one which is terrified, such as: AH!!! HOLY SHIT WHAT WAS THAT?!?!?!?! Both were heard today. About three people got hit in the head by candy. We started saying "Heads up" and all people would do was look up just to get konked. Or they would be like, "Why heads up?" clunk , "Oh." No rain! Beautiful day...a bit buggy though. lol, we had to use my dad's truck battery in our cart...sucker...lol. Nah, just messing. It was a lot of fun today. Daaang, I need to clean. Have a good day! -J9
Today: I shopped with my mom and she ended up getting a few shirts. I, myself, decided to save myself some dignity and did not look for shorts or anything or that sort and bought two shirts -green and white-, along with a belt that includes buttons of Einstein, a robot, and one that says "COFFEE NOW" lol. Perfect for Battlecry. Then, stopped in to wish my brother well in his new home in Atlanta, Georgia with Laine (who was away working). Nextly, went to see The Day After Tomorrow . Definitely not what it is cracked up to be, trust me. Following, played pool at A's to kill time before next movie. Please not that I did horribly. A few nice shots here and there, but that was all. Lastly, went to see Van Helsing . The parts I saw did not seem very spectacular but I do not wish to give much of an opinion as seeing that I slept through seriously 85%. However, I did see about 10%. The other 5%, I was outside the theatre in the lobby or on the phone lol. Greeeat. Got home around 1:08AM after a quick pit stop at Dunkin Donuts. Now, I am about to fall asleep here typing. Therefore, I am going to get something to drink, as seeing that I am terribly thirsty, and then go to sleep, as seeing that I have to wake up at 6:15AM in order to get to the high school for 7AM to load up stuff to get to Suffield a short time later to decorate the truck and march in that parade. Then, rush back to Windsor Locks and march again. Rain is expected, folks. Good night -J9
I will keep this short since I am probably going to update again tonight anyways. I'm wicked curious as to some sort of "good news" that I have been hearing all about. I hope that this person will give me a call at some point today when they have time. Days plan: Shopping with the mother, BQ for my brother Josh who is moving to Atlanta with his girlfriend Laine, then I suspect nothing. Last night I actually got to play pool. I have actually gotten better. Everytime someone left me with solids I did horribly for some reason. I always tried to sink the 15 ball first, and whenever I did, I seemed to have a better game. I am so weird lol. Anyways, keeping it short...I hope you have a good day! ::sunburn...ouch...at least I wore a hat yesterday...but my shoulders are killing me!::
I woke up this morning after having gone to bed at 5:30am at 7:15am to see the sun brightly shining and to hear news that it was to be a beautiful weekend. Since a train seemed out of the question, the canal was calling me. I get dressed for it, pack a bag, and make a plan. As I head out my stepmom was in a very sour mood. She went off on us and I decided to stay in and purge my anger on cleaning every square inch of my bedroom. That did not last long. I could not tolerate being here. So instead, I set off on my walk. As I went on my way I decided that since I got and hour and 45 minutes worth of sleep and had nothing to eat or drink, that I should probably get something. On my way, the stepmom catches up and apologizes so we are all good again. Lunch, la ti da, canal. Walked it. Saw a lot of wildlife: Cardinals, blue jays, pigeons, snakes, turtles, fishies, ducks, butterflies, dragonflies, people...lol I was being dumb and decided to poke the snake with a stick. It did nothing so "Hmmm, maybe it is dead," thinks J9... ::poke:: J9 discovered the snake was, in fact, NOT DEAD. How one may ask? It becomes fairly apparent after it lashes out at you. Yeah, go J9...you are a winner...lol One of the two highlights of the walk was talking to a very amiable older gentleman who had spent a good amount of time on the canal. According to him (his name is Dick, by the way), I am very serious about my walking lol. The second, was laying down underneath the train bridge. I waited for the train that I could have potentially been on to pass directly overhead and then stared at the water. I saw a few fish come up to feed which was pretty nifty. Anyways, after getting home I collapsed feeling very out of shape. My ankles feel as though they are ready to break and the pads of my feet are burning. The worst part...I do not think that I surpassed 15 sit-ups because I was just that wiped. As soon as I recover a bit I will probably clean a bit more and head out again. I have no idea if I have plans or not tonight. Oh well. I should probably just finish my room so that I have a place to sleep tonight...assuming that I do that anyways. Well, I shall end this post right about... no no no a little more to the right There you go Right here. See y'all later lol
Well, I made it to Friday. However, that does not mean that it was necessarily easy by any means. The situation sprouting from Stonewall Speakers continues to become more and more absurd and I am very worried about the career/reputation of a certain teacher involved. Today, all-in-all, definitely could have been much better. This morning I at least woke up on time. I still, however, managed to forget to get hocked up on allergy medication before I left the house. Go me. English - Francoeur was absent so I finished Macbeth to show off on Tuesday, Contemporary American Issues - went online and read my friend Rob (from Lego Maniacs) astrology section of his website. I must admit that it was pretty funny, Study - I read Sense and Sensibility and am now past the 100 page mark, Spanish - test, quite possibly the most difficult that I have taken in that course yet and I am pretty worried about the results, Precalculus - by then most of the school was absent in order to prepare for the senior ball and Panaccione did not feel like doing anything...so we did nothing...except critique a quiz that I barely finished US History - someone dropped athree of spades out the window and the remainder of the class was spent trying to retrieve it using a paper cup covered in masking tape attached to a paperclip chain and ribbon. It rained a lot today making the card very soggy and very impossible to obtain. Seeing about 95% of my class hanging out a window trying to complete the task was very funny, however. That was my "academic" day. Wow, either something is wrong with the pipes in my closet, there is a rather large bee in here, or someone needs to stop snoring. That sound is kind of eerie. Anyways, tonight was supposed to be a trip to On the Border, a very good Mexican restuarant about 45 minutes away from here with Rob, Jon, Emily, Paul, Lauren, Danielle, and Miranda...however...I received no phone call and come to find out the ride had yet to get everything all set with his car...so therefore it was not happening. And, I did not get my amp. Instead, Heather, Ashley, Shawn, and I had decided to go play pool at either A's or Mad Maggie's instead of bowling because I really just was not up to it. Well, I walked to Papa Gino's where they were all going to meet up with me and about halfway through my walk I decided that it had been all-together too long since I had last spoken to Tycho so I called - voicemail - okay. Soon enough I got a call back and got myself pretty worked up. We talked for a while and I just chilled on the stone bench in from of the restaurant. He had to go to get on the train :-( They arrived pretty late, and as soon as they pulled in I saw (and smelled) why. The tender radiator of his precious Honda CRX had blown and the engine was smoking like crazy. They had to call their dad, a cool dude, to come over to help since they live in Agawam and were then in Windsor Locks. He brought water, paper towels, some tools, and... Drumroll please... DUCT TAPE! We ate, got haunted by a stupid game (which I figured out, thank you very much!), and left to go back to Shawn and Heather's house. We ended up just sitting there chatting about the rules of FIRST and watching Happy Gilmore. I missed a portion because I got a phone call, which I was very glad to receive and had decided to step out for a little while where I again managed to work myself up, make a decision, and listen to a bunch of drunken dudes in their backyard. Now tomorrow, I am going to see about making a little trip. I can actually research it a bit now that I have set my computer back up. Come to find out, the guy that fixed my computer kept my power cord...so I thought that I was screwed until I remembered that I once had a laptop and I took the adaptor from that power cord and it is evidently working fine. Actually, this Windows Millenium could be worse. It is working very well, and very swiftly for me. No complaints yet. Um, yeah, I have talked a lot and I am sorry if I had gotten you very bored. I shall stop and check up on my trip. Buenos dias, tardes, and noches todos! -J9
Wow, my second day into using this journal and go figure that some things have begun pointing down...already! I really need to move or something because I really do not feel that it is healthy that I cannot even tolerate the presence of a good majority of my class. Hearing their voices whining or whatever day in and day out has really taken a huge toll on me. I really have never been more stressed than I am today. Elections are over anyways, and the results are just how they should be: Billy K - President David N - Vice President Shannon R - Treasurer (meh...) Cristina Z - Secretary Come to find out there is a public relations position that has been added to the grades below me. Go figure! The one thing that I would actually run for! ::grumbles:: None of my classes were bad, minus my classmates being present. It was one of those days where I just did not want to speak to any of them, but go figure I ended up talking briefly to Bill...who I really did not want to...,Rils, Shannon, Wild Bill, and Sjodin. Oh well. I suck at that "cold shoulder" thing. My mind was definitely wondering worse than normal today. My largest amount of focus was in English this morning where I got to be Murderer #1 in MacBeth. Appropriate for my mood anyways...JUST KIDDING. Got home to see that my stepmom and sister-in-law were home which really added to everything because the whole OCD thing so I needed a loooong walk. So I have walked to the library. Now that I have read what I wished to read, I feel that I may venture further. Maybe I will head out to East Windsor. I am trying to pick a destination since I just want to be far away but I cannot really think of anything. And now I am just rambling. Sorry. If only time would go faster. I think I am off to read Sense and Sensibility for a while. Once I get bored with that I will probably stop somewhere and eat dinner...maybe...before I figure out a way home from how far away I am. Canal...now there is an idea! Have a good evening! -J9
Okay, so LiveJournal was starting to get annoying because people that I did not want reading it were, in fact, reading it frequently. I hope that I am welcome here! And hopefully this is the first post of many...even though I would imagine that no one is going to read this for a while. Although, this site had already given me a good spot of trouble today. I hope it is just an off-day because it is the 25th. What a day to start my new journal on :-/ Go figure. Well, award ceremony tomorrow...meaning I get to find out what I got exactly...while simultaneously missing my meeting. Blast! I sent the e-mail to Dave so it should be all good. Wow. Now that I am using this I have to remember that basically none of my former readers are reading this so everything that I am saying is basically going to be irrelevant. Er, I suppose that I shall need to use my best discretion in choosing who to tell about this journal. ::taps keyboard:: Yeeeah, k...well, I suppose that I am going to run and assume that this post will publish now. Hopefully I will get someone to read it by the end of the night. Talk to y'all later...er...maybe not... -J9
Well I saw you with your hands above your head Spinning around, trying not to look down But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground Then you stumbled around for a good ten minutes And I said I'd never seen anyone look so dumb before And you laughed and said I still know how to turn you on though You're the only one who Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams You're the only one who Knows exactly what I mean And I probably forgot to tell you this Like that time I forgot to tell you about the scar Remember how uncomfortable that made you feel? See you're not what I expected But you're the only one who knows how to handle me And you're such a great kisser and I know that you agree You're the only one who Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams You're the only one who Knows exactly what I mean I hope you can forgive me for that time When I put my hand between your legs And said it was small Cuz its really not at all I guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down Just to keep you around Cuz the day you realize how amazing you are You're gonna leave me You're the only one who Holds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sick You're the only one who Knows exactly what I mean You're the only one who Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams You're the only one who Knows exactly what I mean Exactly what I mean Well I saw you with your hands above your head Spinning around, trying not to look down But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground You're The Only One by Maria Mena
I rely quite heavily on symbolism and karma. Everything happens for a reason. Whether or not we see that depends how how we interpret our situations and the circumstances surrounding them - Me Well, I interpreted something new this morning. I slept with my space heater because it was comforting to have that direct heat on my back. Especially when I am lonely. This morning Tycho called me. I burned myself on that heater. Actually, the shape of the faceplate is now burned onto my skin. That hurt so incredibly bad. But it was a wake up call. I do not need it anymore. I have what I really need. Matt. I really am not alone.
Alright, last night's post probably got a little bit fuzzy (aw, how cute!) because I continuously began to nod off. It was probably from the sleep pattern from the previous couple of days. Oh well, I am good now. Today, I do not even remember waking up really. Nevermind, got it. My dad yelled for me to come to breakfast. That is a decent thing to wake up to. "Home-cooked food, something that you learn a fine appreciation for in the FIRST robotics program" - Jonathan D. Fournier circa 2000. How true. Too bad last night I ate a lot lol. Do not give me that look. I'm serious. Ate Andy Capp's Hot Fries (a lot of them) with Sobe green tea at the rest stop, chicken/spinach salad from Wendy's, baked potato from Wendy's, and then two chocolate chip cookies at the bowling alley. I wanted starchy things for whatever reason. It was bizzare, and I kept mocking it. But anyways, back on track, kids. I want to walk that huge hill again...odd. Two graduation parties today which I nearly somehow forgot about. Wrote up shell cards for both James and Marie. Yes, a shell card for James...muhuhahaha. Walked to Marie's house, not trusting myself with her gift. She will get it eventually. For those who do not know, it was a birthday/graduation party. Now spiffy is that? Got there and chilled with her and her friend Jennifer from Enfield. Played a bit of soccer before Marie opened gifts and then I had to run over to James. His friend Jill gave him a DVD. A wonderful DVD I might add. Monty Python and the Holy Grail I might add. Beautious. We watched that and go figure everyone there knew it all lol. We want to make a broadway version...so be prepared for that. James noted my lack of hyperness-i-tude, buddy. Poo, I was still tired, and am a bit depressed from missing someone. Hell, James never met the kid and he said something along the lines of Tycho being the best for me. Thank you for that James. Remember, Tuesday...it is you, Monika, myself, and Eric the Viking lol. You need to tell me what food to have. I already know that I need root beer for you. I will give you more details such as timeage later. So today was decent, I enjoyed it anyways. I need to go to WalMart and get my glasses fixed. This whole "falling off of my face" thing is really ticking me off. Arg. Anyways, more of what I did not stay awake for last night. I mostly just wanted to include more details and more of how I felt I suppose. If you are uninterested you may stop reading here. Yes, that means you, the reader, who is reading this. I thought that I was so sure of myself and what I had planned to do the instant that I saw Matt. Whoops, how wrong of me. I froze. It felt like everything in my freaking body condensed and I could not have been more happy. I guess it was a good thing that I did not run to him, because his rents probably would have liked to injure me. Actually we did not even go near each other for a few minutes. I wanted to, but I was not sure if he wanted me to. So we all sat there. Tossed the frisbee a bit and talked - but mainly just sat there. We moved to go and play frisbee 'n such. Finally got a hug though. Back at bench, pool. Finally got what I had wanted next to the hug there. I felt awkward because of Shawn, but I warned him...and I should not have refrained from what I really wanted. That was the largest test of self control ever . Eh, I will skip some. Back to the bench lol. The bench. I want to go and steal that bench lol. Just being on that bench has brought me so much. It was there that I sat the times at Frontiers when Matt was the only person to give me the time of day, and no, for you information, no I did not ever tell him to do the proverbial "piss off". That bench...yay. lol :-D ;-) I have to eat, so posting is...er...postponed. Please enjoy this commercial break/intermission. La Ti Da - Gonna be a while? Grab a snickers! - C'mon down to Bob's Discount Funiture! - JC Penny's One Day Only Sale, where everything is 10, 20 30 % off! - Wendy's: Eat great, even late! Introducing the new Wendy's late-night pick-up window, open until 1 AM or later! - Make 7-Up Yours! Okay, okay. I'm done with that. The sad thing is - I really do not watch TV. Movies - yes, TV - no. Eh, some of those are pretty old though, from when I did, in fact, watch a bit of television. Back to Battlecry...or rather...what I did instead of Battlecry... Skipping...skipping...skipping...skipping...ah, okay. Near the wedge. Matt was kinda cold outside, and cars were being weird. Honestly, why would you watch a couple of kids ... er ... sitting on a bench? Anyways, we moved inside and chilled near some lockers. Besides the guy charging back and forth with the umbrella (which he sometimes opened! ::insert exaggerated gasp here:: . That was actually pretty funny. I enjoyed it anyways. That was where we missed the reservation at Sole P. because we were a bit um...preoccupied? Er...we were not hungry! Honestly! Then when we were hungry at like...what was it? 11:30pm? We decided to walk to that Eddie's place...where I think Tych got irritated because I was not going to eat...so I did eat. I was glad that I did, because I was pretty hungry and it helped with the energy part of things. Walked back to Claudio's ... rather quickly because it had gotten a bit more chilly and we were figuring on having to let Claudio in at midnight I believe it was. Got back there, I think his name was John was just leaving. He got some pizza. Well, waited for Claudio...he got back and then left for a party for a few again. Came back again, chilled for a few...slept. Tych and I...really did not do much sleeping. We sort of made up for lost time until it was very bright outside... then we went to sleep. That was awesome. I got to figure out a few things he liked n'such. He, however, figured something out also...and I do not know if he did realize the extent to which what he figured out worked. I imagine that he did since he seemed to comment on it most of the time lol. Well, what can I say? Damn, I can feel myself turning red just writing this. I think I could have potentially injured blood vessels in my face from blushing so much, especially since Tych figured out pinkching my cheeks and touching my nose makes me instantly "glow". Then telling me that I am red just makes it that much worse lol. It was pretty funny actually. But yeah, I sort of said things then that I feel pretty silly for. Getting caught up in the moment, you sort of think for the moment, and then when you calm down later realize that you said things that you probably would not have said under other circumstances. That does not mean that I did not mean what I said really, I just cannot believe that I did say them, and I do not know how they were looked upon by the receiving end. Tough situation. I am glad of how the night turned out though. Being able to sleep next to the person that means the most to you is the best feeling ever. Especially when you were not sure if you would be able to or not and then it works out in your favor :-D Waking up was tough too, because I did not want to leave because that seems like it would speed time up and we would not be able to be together as much for as long if we did leave. We had to, sorrowfully. I caught up on the competition a bit and saw Brittany. It was nice to see her, and lucky for me she agrees with my being with Tycho and he thinks that she is a cool person. That is a step up from the days of old in itself too. I could not help but think back to Frontiers a lot of the time there. I grew up since then. I can feel it. I thought of sitting on that bench hoping that someone would come and talk to me...like I used to do before I became as social as I am. I remember kicking myself in the ass because that was not how I wanted to act. I wanted to be known as a very social person, and that was not the way to do it. I was supposed to go find people, get along with them, and have a great time. Once robotics came around I did more of that. Other than my team in that competition, I really just did not mix well with the other students there. The PAs yeah, they were great, and I talk to them more than any of the residents next to Brandon. I seem to actually do that a lot too. I guess I am just more used to people that are older than me. Mostly what I thought of though, was again being on that bench waiting for someone to talk to me. Matt usually asked if I was okay, and if I was sure. I would just say that I was, because I basically was. I just reacted very poorly. I know if I were there now I most certainly would not have done the same things. I would be the way I would have liked to if I was. When no one did talk to me it was the dismay and depression that set in. I felt that I was unaccepted there, and that just seemed to confirm it. I was very self-conscious and almost self loathing. I was amazed that I did not cut myself when I was there. I just wanted to sit alone, and be alone until the end of the trip. I opened up to my team and Lisa by the end and became more myself. I was a bit fake about it, but I still got better. I would not eat around anyone, but I would sit in the room and listen to conversations. I sat with Kristen a few times. Sat with Kat's group a few times. Matt(not Tych) and Frank usually tried to help me. I see that now, there were people I got along with and did not mind me being with them. Mike, Eric, Frank, Matt (again not Tych), Brandon, Lisa, sort of that group. I cannot say I did nothing there. I set myself in here and there. Crud helped. A lot. I even talked a bit to Tycho there, even though I was pretty sure he did not want me to. I still hate the fact that I did not hang out with him and his residents when I skipped out on the mall. That bench though. That was where I got the most attention from Tycho, who I actually had a crush on during the program lol. A few people found out about that and were highly amused. They did not think I liked anyone there, nevermind having had a crush lol. They tried( maybe succeeded) numerous times to tell him about it too. I cannot say that I minded all that much because it was true. I ended up telling him online afterwards. On the bench this year at Battlecry though, I was on that bench. Instead of thinking about how I had a crush on Tycho, he was there with me. I was, and still am amazed. Frontiers worked out for me. Every bit. Took a while, but it did. I have regrets, but yet, I do not. Everything happens for a reason. I have rambled for quite some time now. I wonder how boring it was. That was basically everything that ran through my mind, unabridged. I am just amazed. I am with the person that I really wanted to be with since last July. Wow. I do not know what else to say, just wow. It is the most awesome thing and the most awesome feeling ever. I will stop now lol, sorry y'all. We are free, so let me know if you want to do something even though I will probably contact y'all. My room is getting done so there is plenty of room to chill and sleep. Take care and have a good one! -J9
Okay, I hope that y'all have gone to the bathroom, gotten something to eat, have something to drink, have said goodbye to family/friends, and are prepared not to make any plans - and say hello to Clause! Sorry, Denis Leary segment there. However, y'all should be prepared, because my memory is hopefully flowing into overtime and I am going to convey a portrait of my weekend for y'all. My away message is up and I am ready to type! Friday, woke up around 9:30am so that was not too bad. A nice change of pace. Then I was left with the duty of entertaining myself for about four and a half hours. I got dressed and ready, chilled with my brother, and cleaned a bit. I had gone through my checklist to ensure I would not forget anything of massive importance for the weekend. I knew I needed a change of clothing including my team shirt, dream catcher, and money ($160 from my mom the night before) - none of which I forgot. I was all set and ready. Just needed to wait for my ride to be out of work at noon and set out at about 1:30/2pm. Well, he had gotten out of work early and decided to meet me at about 12:30pm instead. No complaints. We set out and were well on out way by 1pm. He ended up taking a route that I was unfamiliar with, but whatever. My concern was simply that we had gotten there, which we did. I ended up showing him around the campus and telling him things I learned at WPI. Saw a PA from Frontiers and thought I would find Tych through him. Instead he chilled with us as I sat at my regular bench. Tych was spotted coming in and I guess that it is a good thing that I decided against running to him. I just stayed on my bench basically in shock out of happiness. We sat around and talked for a little while, a bit of frisbee, which led into more frisbee on the quad which was enjoyable. Matt met another soon-to-be PA for Frontiers. More sitting on the bench trying to decide what to do. I finally decided that I felt like playing pool, so Tych taught us Cutthroat (spelling?) which was a pretty nifty game. I really had no focus and could not remember a damned thing that was going on lol. That was pretty bad. I did horribly, but whatever. I knew I would. I one once. The soap opera that was on was pretty disturbing too. I can definitely do such a better job than that. Well, after was more confusion of what to do. I think this is where we walked to Claudio's so we would know where it was then Tych was inclined to show we the "Most Magicalist Place in the Land" aka Price Chopper because I had never been there. Then we decided to walk up a huge hill. That was not too bad, my legs are feeling it which is good. The view on top was awesome. Then we went back to campus center for air conditioning. In the campus center we went on computers to check on the Sole Proprietor (again, spelling?) and I ended up showing Tych an e-mail I saved which got a bit of redness. Tehe. Then I think that was where we decided to drop Matt's stuff off and I manage to cut myself on the porch. Go me! Anyways, this led into walking back to competition and watch a bit before deciding to split up for the evening. I stayed with Tych and then came more bench sitting. Some cool stuff happened there but a perverted station wagon-y type vehicle was not helping...so we went over to the dorms and chilled by some lockers. That was nice. Minus the guy charging up and down the wall way with an umbrella, which was pretty funny. Missed reservations at Sole P. so decided to grab something quick at Ernie's, which has really good pizza, before going back to Claudio's. We had to beat him back because we had his keys. Got there and met John (right?) and then Claudio got back a short time later. Had a good discussion about academics. Shed a bit of a new light for me. If you go to college for something that you are already good at, then great. But if you go for something that you need to work at a little more, and you do work on it, then you learn that also become more well-rounded. Good thought, eh? We ended up watching this ridiculous "Kids in the Hall" or something like that DVD. It was er...interesting. What was so great was being able to be next to Matt and getting to fall asleep next to him :-D Then I was spoiled. The competition started at about 9am I guess, but as seeing that we did not actually got to sleep before about 5:30am, we over-slept that. Until about 11/11:30am. We made it to competition with plenty of time. We watched a few rounds and otherwise rotated between outside and campus center. We just sat, talked, and were close. Dancing at the competition was great too, I really enjoyed that. I also saw and got to talk to a lot of old friends such as Saul, can't remember his name, JJ, Rob, and Ashley. Our team did the usual, make it to finals - crap out. All good. Walking away from Tycho again at the end of the day was once more the hardest things I ever had to do. It hurt so much. I wanted to look back, but knew if I did that I would be inclined to run back. I miss you. The trip the way back, I was so random. I kept singing "Buttercup", "Soul Man", and then I oddly enough really wanted either a hot stuffed pretzel or baked potato. I ended up getting the potato lol. Bowling with Jennie, Mark, and Kristen. Fun stuff. Tomorrow, graduation party for Marie and another for James. Busy stuff. There is a lot of detail that I did not yet (if I do) go into. Thank you for your time and attention. Matt, I have the dreamcatcher. I will try to get it to you ASAP. So much not listed. Too tired. Arg. Well, I am going to get some sleep. G'night all, take care. Tycho, me amo ti mucho. Miss you soo much, thank you for the weekend. ::hugs:: :-* -J9
Expect a huge post when I get back from bowling!!!!!!!!!!! :-D
Now it is official for me. I have just officially completed my junior year 25 minutes ago. Those last two finals were awesome! So easy! Well, maybe a coffeehouse celebration tonight...except the group it was with (lucky college students who have been out for a while mocking me) called and said there was a change of plans. Since this is "my night", I am scared shitless. I have no idea what they are doing. I am sure it will be wicked fun though. Er...should I dare to say that? Battlecry, as Brian would say: Crackie3312003: wpi t-minus one day and counting Or...Boston...or...well...I do not know. I am not treading on that ground quite yet. I am so glad that I have used writing so much as an opportunity to eliminate conjunctions from my written vocabulary. It saved so much time and grief on my history final. That is her big things, and now I am fairly accustomed to automatically avoiding them. There are a few cases where you are screwed because the sentence is so awkward without those little partial words with commas. If you try to say it properly you seem wicked British...or royal...or old...or something! What else. Did I mention that I am free? lol, sorry. Good feeling. Academic stress = non-existent. This week anyways. I am going to relax before starting the English work. Did I mention, I finally get to see my tehanu soon? Well, you know the deal :-D I am such an asshole for again falling asleep. It is called caffine Janine!!!! Dang. I know there were things that I wished to actually post...but they have gone over my head again. Working on the yearbook last year again another person that I met commented on how I look like someone that they know. How could anyone else look like me? I have never seen them...but I do feel badly for them if that is the case. They also commented on how frequently I show up. 19 times. I love pictures, what can I say? I do not care how dumb I look in them, that is the fun part that makes you look back and laugh. There are a few I actually really like too. I tried to nail Tony for showing up a lot, but I have him beat by three. Woo hoo. That is what he gets for making me run across a hot parking lot barefoot to get the frisbee...that I did a horrible job throwing...lol Actually he got most of them, which was appreciated. Frisbee is fun! Um, I should stop huh? Since who knows what is happening tonight and I will probably update again. SAT scores Friday...I guess I will have to wait unless I can talk someone into checking and give them...my password...sniff. I should change that to something pointless then change it back after...hmmm Okay, like I said, I am done. Tengo muchos muchos ganas de menos de ti, Matt, me amo ti mucho, como nada en este mundo!
When I first went to update, I seriously thought that I was getting alzehimers or something because I knew I wanted to post something, but I was not sure what. Considering this is my second update today already I will save the update about tonight's meeting for tomorrow. Hopefully I will not be able to update all weekend because I will be away. Either in Worcester or in Boston. Sunday, however, is Marie's graduation party. Which, as seeing that I am missing the graduation itself on Friday, I would not miss her party. I think that did not really matter because we have Friday and Saturday, not Sunday. So, back to what I wanted to update about. 4.5 hours of school left! 7:45-9:45 Chemistry and 10:00-12:00 History. I am not worried about either. Chemistry a little bit, but I suspect it should be fine. Okay, yesterday I was sitting at Dunkin Donuts drinking my orange coolatta right? Well, an elderly lady, an' I mean the elderly lady you catch in Vegas with her catty friends, comes in. Leopard pants an' all, baby! Then, following her is her normal, seemingly down-to-Earth husband. Figure that. Well, she brings their stuff to the table right next to me. Of all the open seats, she goes to that one. Their stuff included a newspaper and crosswords. For the record everyone, I hate having my back to motion, and will tend to sit with my back to a wall and face out a window because I enjoy watching the people and cars go by. BDunkin Donuts is great for this because it faces the pike and I set the sun through the massive windows, which there are three in front of where I sit. This lady proceeds to go to the windows and begins closing the blinds! I figure, oh well, she is only doing one. Then she moved on to the next one. Okay, a bit irritated. Then I looked to the third window and thought, oh...hell no. She did it, all three. As she seated herself with me giving her a bizzare look, she smiles and says hi. Then she sits and begins to complain about the toughness of the donuts. A message she will not receive but was running through my head: Look, you are not at home. You could sit somewhere else or put your back to the window, however, right now you are infringing upon my rights. It is 3 in the afternoon...and you expect the donuts would be fresh? So on and so forth. It was funny when I was rambling it all out in the car. For some reason that was frustrating. Any thoughts on this? TuRbOfReAk05: if death is the greatest adventure ion life, then whats the sence of living? TuRbOfReAk05: i mean what is there to live for> Jaenen6: I do not believe hat death is the greatest adventure in life, so I cannot answer that TuRbOfReAk05: well lets say it is Jaenen6: Then your other adventures in you life may not be the greatest, per say, but they are still worth having. Along with for the people in your life TuRbOfReAk05: are they really? Jaenen6: I believe so TuRbOfReAk05: Do you really know who you are? Jaenen6: Yes A bit odd. Whatever. I have to run. Meeting tonight. Me amo ti mucho, siempre, Matt! Tengo ganas de menos de ti! ::hugs::
"Quick thoughts" are never very quick with me, are they? I always ending writing so much. I guess it is not really a bad thing that it does not take very much for me to write a lot. That works for me, probably bores you, the reader, who is reading this. lol, sorry if it does. If it just gives you something to read and you really do not mind it, then I am glad :-) Overview for the day: -Leaving for school around 9:30 to arrive at 9:35. Then I intend to wander until 9:45 and then find friends who just got out of their third period finals. At 9:55-ish, I will go to my Spanish class then begin the final at 10:00 and end at 12:00. -Home, to do ... nothing? Probably clean...if I can make myself do it :- -Organize some more FOCC stuff so that I have something to talk about at tonight's meeting -Help a friend with a problem -Meeting tonight from 6:00 - ? usually 8:30. Jay should be back which means that I will have Project C.R.E.A.T.E. also. -Hopefully talk to my one and only. It is such an awesome feeling when all you have to do it think about someone and you cannot help but smile and feel completely uplifted. I smile a lot now :-) Hm, I could have slept in today, and hre I am....wide awake at 6:30. For whatever reason I was waaaaay too tired last night. I could not stay awake. I think it is just the rapidly changing weather accompanied by finishing out school. So close. Well, I hope everyone has a great day and to talk soon! Matt, gracias por todo que hagas. Me amo ti mucho!
School that is. It is bittersweet. I had a really good time this year and really enjoyed my teacher. This has been a hell of a year for me. The social pressures and experiences that I had. The chances I made. The maturing that I did. The friends I had the honor of having in my life. The friends that I have the honor of having in my life. Not to mention finally being truly happy with someone. I want to go over the major experiences after this academic year. I wish that I did it in years prior. Wait, why the hell not.

I missed them so much. I am also talking to all sorts of new people. One has come up being very negative, but I am not going to hold that against him. I understand. I think... People no longer see me as "quiet". They see me for who am I, and we have fun together. I love laughing all the time, and I usually do. Nothing has been able to dampen my spirits. Things work out, everything happens for a reason. Life is finally the way I want it, I am living up to who I want to be, I am doing the things I want to, I am succeeding. Most importantly, I have all of my friends. I love being able to care for them, and in return they care for me. It does not matter where we all go, we have fun just the same, because it is about the company. I hope to become closer to some again, Jennie...since I do not disrespect you, I would love to hang out more. Rils, you are my best friend, and we really do need to hang out All of us, I want us to go and do what we have always dreamed of. What is my short-term dream? Go somewhere special, like the Enders, bring everyone's favorite outdoor lunch, radio, and just be there. Reminisce, make new memories. I would love for it to be Tycho if he wanted to bring someone, Ari, Billy, Brian H, Britt, Christine, Frank, Izzy, Jennie Tim, Jess Shawn, Kristen, Heather, Marie, Mon Mon, Murky, Rils Nick if she wished, Roni Andy, Robbie and his crew, Shawn, Steph, and others. That is the core group lol. Maybe more people from other robotics teams. That would be a massive party lol. Actually, I think that is basically all of my friends. I should invite the entire Aces High team, I consider them all my friends...tehehe. Wow, I have been in such an untouchably good mood. Some things hit here and there...but I get over it. It is so great! Ea tebea liubliu Tych!!! :-D
Well, barely slept last night. I basically re-did my entire room. When I woke up it was off to school, where I did my best possible on the precalculus. It was not as easy as the first half as I had expected, but it could have been worse. Left school, got brunch with my mom, and as we pulled in so did Robbie. After getting gas, caffeine, directions, and a new windshield wiper, we were off. I was ecstatic! We were on the Mass Pike, and I was counting down the miles until Boston. Then, Robbie got a very concerned look upon his face. He could not move the shifter. The clutch probably blew. We were stuck in the middle of the pike, I think a ways out of Palmer. Got towed back to Enfield, CT. Got taken out to lunch by Robbie's rents. Then, they gave me another surprise, which I have reiterated like four times now lol. It lifted my mood immensely, but it is still low. I have that headache that I used to have when I worried excessively. Am IM that I also just received helped immensely. Listening to DKM too. I was so close. Now some of my friends have had a bad day also and wish to take a walk to unwind...and I am not even in the mood for that. I just feel ill. Very physically ill. My dad is starting to think that I have blood sugar problems and need to see a doctor. Crap. Well, I am going to go, and remember, Tycho, don't give up on me ...
I just messed up on an entry in Livejournal, which showed me a whole new way to do posts. Either I am slow, or this is new. When you are done posting, and you are in the text box hit "Tab" "Enter" and it brings you to a different screen where you can put other nifty things in. I do not know, maybe it is something old that I just discovered, again because I am slow... Whatever. Today I woke up early, called my mom to discuss a very important issue, then headed out to McLean's park. I walked up to the summit and then waded around in the brook. It was sort of cold, but it felt wicked good on my feet. Then, sprawled out in the parking lot on a towel doing the shorts/bikini top things in order to tan a bit. The heat of the sun was so relaxing. Then, basketball. I have not lost my touch :-D I was proud of that. Again, napped in the sun a bit. That is why I sleep with my space heater. Something about direct heat on my back or something, it is just relaxing. I know something else that would relax me and finally allow me a truely good nights sleep, but that may take a while. I am willing to wait. Last of the precalculus final tomorrow, this is good. I am looking forward to it! I am getting out of school early tomorrow :-D. Hopefully I will be on my way to Boston with Robbie and whomever else. After I get there they can do whatever. I just want to see my certain someone :-D. This means that I am going to spent the night cleaning, but that is okay Not sure what else to post. Had a pretty good phone conversation with Tycho. I was so happy to hear his wonderful voice again, I missed it immensely! Have a good one, -J9
Well, I was going to do this huge post on all of the awesome things that happened today, but I have discovered that they do not mean shit if you are prevented from being with the person that you really want to be with. -Slept until noon -Hiked with dad, stepmom, brother, his girlfriend, and Cali -Lots of ticks and bug spray -Chased frogs -Got home and then set out to chill with Robbie and Paul -Swung on huge rope into pond, swam a bit -Chilled at Paul's girlfriend Lauren's house. -Made friends with a kid that I thought I would not like due to Jon -Discovered that Jon talks a lot of crap about me behind my back and that I royally fucked up his transmission -Got offered to play paintball with them all and kick his ass -Thought about partying at Pauls, but then we all went bowling -Got home, and now all this The part of my life that matters most...is probably having the most difficult time with his parents ever...because of me. As I said to him, I do not believe that I have ever hurt so bad in my entire life. I got home around 1...got told a few minutes later...it is now 1:32 and I have been crying since. Why does it have to happen this way. I do not want to loose him...ever. I wish I could just run there, not caring what anyone thought or said. There is only one person who matters. Here Without You - 3 Doors Down A hundred days have made me older, since the last time that I saw your pretty face A thousand lies have made me colder and I don't think I can look at this the same But all the miles that separate They disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face I'm here without you baby, but you're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby, and I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby, but you're still with me in my dreams And tonight, there's only you and me The miles just keep rolling, as the people leave their way to say hello I've heard this life is overrated, but I hope that it gets better as we go I'm here without you baby, but you're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby, but you're still with me in my dreams And tonight (boy), there's only you and me Everything I know and anywhere I go It gets hard but it won't take away my love And when the last one falls, when it's all said and done It gets hard but it won't take away my love I'm here without you baby, but you're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby, but you're still with me in my dreams And tonight (boy), there's only you and me
I had a good post...good length...then...the update page "Could not be found"...so now my post is long gone... Blast. Okay, short short version Road in front of house = paved next week Maybe driveways too Precalculus final = multiple choice = easier than anticipated No hike - PepBoys, thought a lot about my car. Although not standard, going to rice it out, and automatic is probably a better idea for now. Hope Tycho realizes that no one has anything on him Miss him ::sniff:: Soon! :-D Pink series of Hondas (4) on the pike. Evan's Saturn "on steroids" kicked the crap out of Mike's Civic...TWICE. I would never want to give that credit to Saturns, but I have no special fondness to Civics (minus Del Sol), but that was awesome! Rims, neons, stereos, spoilers, vinyls, NOS, exhausts, mufflers, everything. Tycho and I had serious talks, which I am grateful for because then I know what is going on. I appreciate you giving me the honor of lisening when you had something to say. Please have a good one, take care. -J9
Friday, finally. I actually woke up earlier than I was supposed to this morning and headed off to school. Marie was not around for rides which meant that I had to fend for myself, which is also known as trying to remember where the bus went, and when it did so. I headed out at 7:03 AM and stood there for several minutes talking to the construction workers. I guess they were supposed to pave the gravel sections of road in front of my house this week but they are doing it next week. They may also do driveways, ::evil grin:: Precalculus final = multiple choice = I did much better than I was anticipating. Anyways, did not hike. Instead we wandered around PepBoys. There is a lot that I wish to put into my car, however, I would like a more race-worthy car. Or a standard transmission anyways. The automatic is just a better idea for now. The Laser will look good, but not race well ...can we say RICER? lol Then, it was off to the pike. The first part was simply talking to my favorite person ever. Some serious conversation came up, but that is a good thing because we should be able to talk and I am extremely appreciative that he gave me the opportunity to listen. Then, the awesome cars started coming out. Rims, neons, exhausts, mufflers, spoilers, kits, everything. A few races. I finally must give props to SATURNS ON STEROIDS lol. Evan kicked the crap out of Mike's Civic, not once, but twice. Not surprised. I am not seriously over-joyed by Civics, although I am fond of the Del Sols. New amp...sounds like ass. Sorry Tych. Series of PINK cars. Hondas all. Funny! One guy had a blow-up doll for a passenger! headed back, and scoped a couple side streets for short races tomorrow. I will probably video tape them. We want to bring the pike out to Ella Grasso lol. Now I am letting the adrenaline cool a bit, I was allowed to drive. WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE lol. Bad part of evening: I knew only a handful of people and presence of drugs. ICK Anyways, I am going to run, please take care. Have a good one! -J9
As difficult as it was, I left y'all a day to recover from my previous posts lol. Today was my last real day of school. Tomorrow and Monday I start finals, which detracts from them being normal days. Schedule from Friday on: Friday - Final 7:30-8:30, normal day WEEKEND (Saturday is a fund raiser with Lego Maniacs, maybe...) Monday - Normal class, Final 8:34-9:34, normal day Tuesday - Final from 7:45-9:45, home Wednesday - Final from 10:00 - 12:00. home Thursday - Final from 7:45-9:45, final from 10:00-12:00 Friday - Leaving for Worcester probably about 10:00AM :-D Last night Dave e-mailed me and contacted Tony about heading up the meeting which I finally got to do fully :-D I walked to John's house, got the keys, then walked the rest of the way to the meeting where Tony, Frank, and I chilled outside and played a bit of frisbee while joking with some kids on the other side of the parking lot lol. I think the girls were hitting on Tony lol, because his kick ass car. Too bad he's 24 (4 right?) and they were in middle school lol. The meeting was quick and I got a ride home. While dropping off the keys Stanhope ran up and told me I probably got more done than Dave :-X lol Today: English: Watched Macbeth Contemporary: Did Spanish project Study: Wrote a letter to people that I will probably never send :- Spanish: Slept a bit Chemistry: Took over a lab, fun stuff Precalculus: Slept, discovered that I will be taking that final not next Wednesday as planned, which would leave me more study time, but TOMORROW...from 7:30AM to 8:30AM! Then again on Monday, 8:34AM-9:34AM!!! Ack! Then I got my summer assignments for my English 111 course. I need to check some text books out for the summer. A full year...like...365 days with those books ahead :-\ I am a sick human being, I am looking forward to it! Reading some classics, like Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte (as I have already done), short stories, essays, poems, and then writing my own essays. I feel like this course is going to be very good for me :-D College work! College freshmen course :-D Damnit, which means all of those UCONN things I avoided on that CT thing count towards me. This course if a collaboration with UCONN and counts for credit there. Oops. Stayed after with Pease. At least Chemistry is all cleared up. Tonight I get to drive for two whole hours. I am helping teach a course tonight in Tunxis. How do you spell that anyways? Well, that. One hour up, one hour back. Fun stuff. Practice for driving for long periods of time this summer lol Speaking of, that letter I wrote n'such were all in regards to one situation that has put ice in my gut all day. I realize that Tycho was getting in trouble to the phone last night and I hope that I did not tick his rents off for keeping him on the phone for so long. I have been wicked worried, I do not want him or his rents POed at me. :-( I hope to contact him at some point today. That was a huge part of what was on my mind today, that and missing him. Well, I have to go in a few. Talk to y'all later! -J9
I scored a 56% on the "How Massachusetts are YOU?" Quizie! urlLink What about you? THIS IS SO TRUE. I wrote if I followed it or not after each in bold lol. 1. Going to IHOP at midnight is an acceptable dinner. Usually Denny's, but yes it would be 2. Your neighbor, their best friend, and their mother in law all drive Jetta’s. One of my best friends does and my brother lol 3. 90 percent of the population between 15 and 19 own a car. Yeah, that is about right 4. And 80 percent are SUV’s. Ouch, not really. Honda Civics... 5. You must order DMB tickets 6 months ahead of time even though they’re doing three shows. Most definitely! 6. The “meadows” doesn’t mean a field-type place. Meadows means the UTC Regional!!!!!! And DMB concerts... 7. unless you live in Coventry I don't live there 8. You don’t even hear of Coventry until you’ve lived in CT for a good twenty years plus. I am not 20, but I have been to Coventry 9. You thought the only highways are 91 and 84. There are other highways? Just kidding, I am on 2 and 6 a lot also :-P 10. Your high school rival football game is the event of the month. Eh, more like basketball 11. You own a bikini and snowpants. Yes, actually... 12. A trip to Cape Cod is “just another weekend.” Hell, I almost moved there 4 years ago! 13. You actually think Hartford’s big. I live in Windsor Locks, what isn't big compared to that?! 14. It amazes you each and every time you see how small CT looks on a map. Pretty much, but then I look at Rhode Island and say, "HA HA" in a Nelson-like manner. 15. And then you look at Rhode Island and laugh. Oops, I should have read ahead...I suppose that further proves that this one is certainly true...that is creepy...I need to move lol 16. The entire goal of summer is to get a tan that will last through November, at least. Agreed 17. The most exciting thing to do is go to the movies, and you even have to go out of town for that. Sadly enough, it is out-of-town... 18. UCONN basketball rules and nobody can tell you elsewise. Damn straight 19. You think bars are only for those 21 and over. Liquor stores are for 21 and under...but you have to go to MA for that 20. And parties are for those 20 and under. Hence the liquors stores...this is pretty dumb coming from someone who is anti-alcohol... 21. You know what weed is by the third grade. Definitely 4th...so probably. Proud to say, I do not know it first hand :-) 22. Scratch that, first. Let this "screw you" go out to whomever made this...but kinda true 23. You notice each incoming freshman class is getting shorter and shorter. Hell yeah they are, no joke!!! 24. You, your best friend, or your mom has attended UCONN. One friend at UCONN 25. Your “backup” schools are central, UHA, URI, Northwest, and Eastern. I have lost so many friends to those bandwagon schools, I am schooling in MA! 26. You wonder why everyone calls CT the “rich state.” Kinda...I am not rich! 27. You complain about the minimum wage being only $6.90 when most states barely break $5 (honest, CT is highest minimum wage in country besides DC). Actually we are over $7.00 now I think... 28. Timbs are meant for both men and women. Yeah, they are boots...honestly 29. “word” is an acceptable response. lol, not from me 30. Your home ec./foods teacher is male. Nope, ha! What now?! 31. Foods is a class offered at your high school. Yeah...thankfully I have never taken it! 32. A 3.5 is something to pout about for a week. Hey, it could have been a 3.6! Wait, does that mean that we are smart here? 33. You cannot pronounce your C’s and T’s. It is the "R"s that I fear...lol :-P 34. Therefore Connecticut id pronounced ki-nedda-cuh. Huh? 35. The word ghetto has at least 20 different meanings, non even near the real one. In the gheeeeeeeeeet-tooooooooo! 36. You can complete the sentence: “Blazin’ 18 ___” "Blazin' 18 Hits In A Row On The Hott 93.7!" 37. Cow Tipping sounds like the greatest field trip ever. If the cows would not get hurt, that would be pretty funny! 38. You have the need to go on a “roadtrip” but just drive around your town for hours b/c you’re afraid of getting lost. We drive around town because we have school the next day thank you very much! 39. You promise the second you’re 18 it’s out of CT forever, but you end up going to UCONN and living here for the rest of your life. No UCONN, I am moving when I go to college...NOT AT UCONN!!! 40. Except for that year you decide to “try out” NYC Meh... 41. And get scared and come back. Fun-ny ha-ha 42. Theatre isn’t just for those in black turtlenecks with coffee mugs. Well, it isn't! I've seen dark blue! :-P 43. You’ll “settle” for Starbucks. Starbucks is good... 44. You think you’re the coolest b/c you’re walking around with a coffee mug (filled with hot chocolate). Hell yeah, hot chocolate WHAT WHAT! lmfao 45. There is about 30 variations of “Park” in the state (road, street, ave, etc.) Oh yeah, in this town alone!! 46. You hear people moved halfway across the country just to go to your school. We have a few from different countries! :-D 47. Everyone else goes to UCONN for the good education. You go because it’s only $4,000 a year instate. I would, but I do not like party schools, and I wish to be closer to someone. My ideal school is in MA 48. Scratch that, its EDUMACATION not education. Ha! True! 49. Your AP Calculus class is filled with sophomores. If we had AP calculus...we are mathematically inept 50. Flannel PJ pants are the official attire of midterm/finals week. Isn't it everywhere? 51. Midterms don’t exist. They are “midyear assessments”. I have heard both lol 52. There are at least 5 coffee shops within a quarter mile of each other. In Hartford yeah, Bill and I used to raid them lol 53. Buckland Hills and Westfarms become your favorite two (well, three) words. Buckland is okay, Westfarms sucks. Holyoke, now you are talking. What about Enfield Square? 54. You’ve been thrown out of and sworn a life of misery if you ever return from at least three stores by age 14. If only one was Brookstones lol 55. You own at least 10 hoodies. There are a couple from robotics 56. And wear tanktops under them. (if anything at all). What is wrong with that? 57. a night of hanging out at the center doing... nothing sounds like the best fun youve had in weeks On occasion 58. IM isn’t an extra, it’s a necessity. Oh yeah, definitely 59. You (or your girl) has had at least one miscarriage by the time you’re 17. Have not personally, but have known plenty 60. You use the term “mad ghetto.” Maybe? 61. Half the kids at your school are mad ghetto. Sorrowfully...just add " " on either side. Damned posers lol 62. Mad is no longer an emotion. To some 63. It’s called a grinder or sub. What else do you call it? 64. “Bradley” is a place you look forward to going. 65. You’ve not only read every Harry Potter book to date, but even reread each numerous times. Sooooooo... 66. As well as the movies. Not all of them, oops 67. You address your friends as “hoe” whether they’re male or female. Eh, jokingly maybe... 68. You park in an illegal spot just so you don’t have to walk. Um, I usually walk. My bad...how un-Connecticutly of me... 69. You are overly amused with this number. hehe 70. 104 Fest and Big Day Off are the two best events of the year. Do not forget Ozzfest! 71. You are wearing at least $200 worth of clothing at all times, whether it be an Abercrombie shirt and jeans, or baggy jeans, fubu tshirt, and Timbs. Um... 72. The kids from the “ghetto” wear $80 jeans, $ 30, shirts, Timbs, and seem to have a sweat headband to match every outfit. Yeah, that is so annoying 73. You have the need to match ALL the time, even when you’re going to bed. That is just my OCD 74. You’ve discovered that pre-wrap makes an awesome headband. It does? 75. Bandanas are a fashion statement. FIRST, hello! 76. You own at least one pair of guy’s pants, no matter what sex you are. Yup 77. Punk underground is underground no more. Heh, true 78. You know almost as many people that can freestyle as there are in Chicago (or at least they think they can). 'fraid not 79. You have life “so hard” because you have to wait a whole week to get that velour hoodie pants you wanted. We aren't THAT bad! 80. Beer Pong and a Bong are musts at any party. It is funny watching people do that...at every party lol 81. Weed is the drug of choice. Seemingly, bah 82. Knowing gay or lesbian people is a commonplace. DON'T GET ME STARTED. It is, and it is NOT a bad thing! Ode to Comtemporary American Issues! 83. Water bottles are to be filled with vodka. Everyday. which is why we could not have bottled water at school... 84. You see a Hartford cop walking down the street with a beer in his hand on St. Patricks day. Would not surprise me... 85. And you then feel the need to yell “Do I smell bacon” at him. Yup, someone usually does 86. Before stealing his beer. Uhhhhhhh 87. You’ve discovered the cup holders at the crown can be moved up to provide, uh, “more space”. The crown? 88. And you understood that the crown was a movie theatre from the moment I said it (unless you though supermarket—then you’re from West Hartford). Dude hey, seriously 89. Jay and Silent Bob were the smartest idea since, well, ever. Since Monty Python... 90. You know what happened on the last episode of real world, road rules, and the challenges. Hell no 91. You actually have enough spare time boredom to have read this far. It is like 3 in the morning! 92. You use movie lines from mall rats and halfbaked in everyday conversation. Mallrats actually lol 93. You start conversations with random people on the street on a regular basis. Oops? 94. And half those people pretend you’re not even there. Heh, how did you know that? :-P 95. You are scared to ride the bus alone unless you live in Hartford. I do not ride any bus but the school one 96. You own a cell phone and have at least one “accessory” for it. Yeah, that is commonplace 97. GO GIANTS AND PATRIOTS! Do not care, to be honest 98. You’ve seen hockey, basketball, figure skating, and a boat show all at the civic center. Actually yes, I worked at the boat show!! 99. Canadians are the silliest invention ever. GRRRRRRRRRR, I am Canadian!!!! 100. You have said “THAT’s SO TRUE!” to every other thing on this list. But as much as we dis it, we Connectican’s can stand (uh, short) and proud and say I love CT. Whoops, typo. I mean I LOVE NY!!!!! My bad
Well, I was hoping that only positive entries would make it in here, but once more there is a few things that I need to get out that I really cannot post on LiveJournal. I could only imagine the reprocussions of that. English - watched a bit more of Macbeth and could barely stay awake Contemporary - listened to a lady drone on about her college that had no appeal to me Study - went to the library and did a good chunk of work for my English final Precalculus - actually took a quiz and answered all questions. If I had answered them correctly or not is a whole different story. I need to stay after with him and go over material for the final. Chemistry - took notes and got confused all period. I eventually have to look at that material tonight. I am staying after for review for that final tomorrow. History - watched a movie and Sjodin gave me her personal phone number to call her and remind her about bringing in another movie which I did around 7:15 pm. My dad forgot about picking me up from school this afternoon but once he did we headed over to the middle school so I could give Michelle the applications and tell her what was going on. I also put in an announcement for the middle schoolers. I told her about my dorm experience and she was basically shocked. It was pretty funny. She and I need to chill sometime because we need to catch up and I want to show her my pictures n'such. Got home, got changed, ran for 20 minutes. A short time after I got out of the shower and talked to my stepmom about joining her and my aunt at the gym/getting a nutritionalist, the power died. For about 3.5 hours. I just used my cell phone to call everyone. I found a spot where I get wicked good reception. 40 minutes without a problem :-) Talked to my stepmom about not volunteering this weekend. I am all set now. Time to rest a bit this weekend for the big upcoming one. I also talked to her about my getting my own apartment in a few years. We discussed me maybe doing a dorm for 2 years, then a 5-year lease on an apartment in MA. My rents are actually thinking about moving out to Holyoke. After high school anyways, where I will have moved out on my own. But yeah, she agrees with me doing my own place, roommate recommended, but I do not forsee that as being a problem. Well, there is a lot of work for finals to do and things are on a roll for FOCC. I am going to talk to people tomorrow night and get in contact with Rage about finally getting a large meeting in :-) Oh, 2005 FIRST Update, compliments of RJ from Rage: MyMountainDew173: 2005 championship criteria is posted Jaenen6: Oh MyMountainDew173: and only 3 utc teams are eligible Auto response from Jaenen6: I will be right back. Jaenen6: Oh MyMountainDew173: yes Jaenen6: Are you guys? MyMountainDew173: no MyMountainDew173: most of utc teams are not in the right tiers MyMountainDew173: that are eligible MyMountainDew173: so only two are but another one is going cuz of their nat'l chairman's win Jaenen6: Buzz is MyMountainDew173: yes MyMountainDew173: but other than 3 teams- the rest of us are in a dog fight if we all want to go Jaenen6: That sucks MyMountainDew173: no kidding, do you realize how tough our regional is going ot be MyMountainDew173: its going to be a fucking war zone Jaenen6: lol, Aces High will not end up fighting for it.

The criteria is posted, and Aces High is probably screwed. My senior year, thanks kids. lol. Oh well, no problem. I have other things (cough people, namely one person...who reads this) to look forward to seeing :-D Okay, I think that I am all set for now. Have a good night all. -J9
Well, this morning I woke up becaus of a very annoying and loud noise which I could have sworn was emulating from my boombox. This caused me to try to turn my boombox off by changing the station, volume, and unplugging it. Then I rememeber thinking to myself, "Oh, it is my phone." Yes, my alarm clock was going off on my phone. I turned it off without even considering the need to wake up and went back to sleep. I woke up at 8:10AM, thought about staying home, remembered the freshmen orientation, and began walking. My brother Billy ended up seeing me and gave me a ride. Thankfully. Random side note: My foot is very asleep...as usual School English: missed it Contemporary American Issues: Made a poster Precalculus: Same story as last class - slept Spanish: Listened to review group ramble on senselessly Chemistry: Brought Marie her juice and caught a glimpse of the freshmen of whom I would be a reigning senior. Mu hu ha ha ha History: Was being a robotier for the freshmen Came home and got a call. I forgot about hiking. I got dressed and we headed out. Quick hike, all good. I am still very sore from the sit-ups. Time that I do more soon though. I feel badly. Came home, talked to my favorite person, and told my dad that I was doing so. :-D Now I keep thinking about the same issue. This issue being wanting to say something, but being unsure of how good of an idea it is. It is something I am lax about with friends. With some friends it is true, such as Britt, Marie, and Rils. I will not say what it is here because that would contradict this paragraph. However, I do not wish to be lax with it, because I want this person to know that I am very serious, and what I am saying is very true. Arg, I will probably slip up and say it one of these days. I have already come very close to doing it. I am so glad that Tycho and I have gotten so close. It makes me feel so incredibly good. Well, hence my recently prior hesitations. Well, none of that is making it obvious. Oh well. lol It still feels like 70°F. Tomorrow it is supposed to get up to the 90s. Good hiking weather. I intend to take a very long walk, and maybe try running some. More of a workout. I know there was more that I wished to post. Oops, y'all get off easy tonight, so please have a good one. -J9 Song related to thoughts for the night (And I love singing Sarah McLachlan and her lyrics are always so deep. This is one of my favorites besides Angel and Building a Mystery)Bold parts are the big hitters. I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories Remember all the good times that we had Let them slip away from us when things got bad Clearly I first saw you, smiling in the sun I want to feel your warmth upon me, I want to be the one I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories I'm so tired,I can't sleep Standin' on the edge of something much too deep It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word We are screaming inside, we can't be heard I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to lose Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night Gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light And I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories Weep not for the memories -I Will Remember You
Well, I have survived another weekend. Now there is just one more to go. Then I will no longer be a junior at all, no more academics, and, most importantly, seeing Tycho. Wow, my fingers do not want to wrok to type tonight. Very tired. Wet out with my mom for the morning. Then cleaned. Then went to Jennifer's with Rob, Evan, and Mely. Did nothing. Remembered things of old and watched them beat the crap out of each other. Then Justin and Jenniger felt to baby-sit and the rest were to follow to get smoked up. I requested that I be brought home. Ended up plying pool again. Did fairly well for my standards anyways. Well, I am sooooo tired. Talkt to y'all, later. -J9
Well, I am doing much better today. I even got a coffee that I refuse to drink. I am turning up caffeine! lol, my dad did not think that the jalapenos that I ate after my caffeine rush were a good idea. Got woken up from "sleeping in" at 8:30 by Rob calling from Jen's phone. They want to hang out and work on Justin's car today. Hell yes. Hopefully I can make it out there since I am cleaning my room now. I cleaned it earlier too and got some of my mother's things back to her. Now I am trying to get more done so I at least have a bed again. Then I can begin to rearrange things. This would not be such a horrible process if I could just take it one step at a time. Arg. I will get there. I have done it once before, and I will do it again. lol, all I could say when I got that call was, "You bastard, remind me to kick the shit outta you when we all hang out." Jen is looking forward to seeing that since she says I am about 1/4 his size lol. She believes that I can do it though ;-P. Yeah yeah Tycho, I know you are probably sitting over there thinking about saying something about me being a pretty intimidating person :-P. I am learning. I hope that you had fun, and I look greatly forward to talking to you again :-D Thank you to those from LiveJournal who commented, by the way. Let us see here, I shoud probably get back to cleaning, especially since I have updated so much in Tycho's absence. I wonder if he'll take the time to read all of it. I am kinda scared about his reading of my last entry before this one. It was just one of those moods. I am out of it now, can you tell? Please? C'mon! I am serious, I am all better! Why do you not believe me? ::sniff:: Just messing around right there. I am not only out of the bad mood, I am in a pretty goofy one. Okay, I am done now, seriously! Have a good day y'all! -J9
Not the best night on earth. Chilled with Leeanna and Lisa at the mall for a while after drinking regular Mountain Dew and Mountain Dew Livewire. That was pretty funny. Chilling in the arcade was fun. They dropped me off and Jen n'the crew picked me up. We hiked and they brought me out to a dam which was awesome. It was very peaceful and I wish I that I had brought a camera with me. I should start doing that anyways. Rils called me which is always pleasant. Luv ya hun. :-D Otherwise, listening to some of the conversation during the night brought up a lot of painful memories and thoughts. I do not think I have ever felt my heart hurt so badly. I feel very emotionally drained right now. I miss Tycho so much, I have really come to need him for me to even be okay. It is basically inexplicable. Whenever I get to talk to him I just become a happier, all-together more optimistic person. I become more of the person I really wish I was all the time - as opposed to having these down times. I decided to try to cut out the pain by drinking more caffeine. Got Monster. I tried to drink it very quickly after only having a salad around 12:30 this afternoon and it started affecting me immediately. Like the No Fear from New Hampshire. What happened with the No Fear was that my hands and arms went cold and were shaking. I could not sit still. My heart was also racing a little bit. Tonight was much worse. My heartbeat was astoundingly, and definitely terrifyingly quick. I could barely breathe. I do not think that I have ever been more scared of something happening to me from an energy drink. Actually, I have never been scared, nevermind terrified. I am not sure if I can give up on caffeine, but I am definitely staying away from it. I layed down and basically had to sleep it off. No worries though, I am back to normal now. Just very depressed. I am sure that I will get over it quickly. I am looking forward to finally being able to sleep in. Of course I will not though. Just because. I think I update too much in this. Maybe I do anyways. It is just nice to finally be able to freely divulge information, which has not been poor information really until tonight. I apologize immensely for the negativity of this post. I assure you that it is strictly temporary. I can never really stay in a negative mood for long. As of the moment thinking of Tycho and Rils is making me smile, so it really is not that bad. I just needed to get it all out. And I do feel that even after this post that I am still going to desire a small amount of support and/or reassurance. I hate to put a load of any sort, but I am sort of looking to Rils and Tycho for that. I know Marie can help me out, or at least help me to turn it into a joke so that I can handle it better. I need a ride with her I think lol. Rils and Tycho, no one is closer to me than you both. Neither of you could ever believe how important you are to me and how much I appreciate your presence in my life. I do not know what I would do. Marie, you never cease to get me to laugh. Whether I am just having one of those days, or there is a new grave and the day has been going along poorly, I always seem to perk up at lunch with you and Brittany. You can always relate, and can understand me. You and Rils always forgive me when I am being moody and act poorly towards you, and I appreciate that a lot. I have written all that because I realized today how important it is to let people know that you realize what they do for you, and let them know how much it means to you. I do not want to loose anyone else. Y'all are my life. I could never wish to have better friends, because they do not exist. Tycho- I really hope that you do trust me in how I feel about you. I could never imagine having the good fortune of being with someone as amazing as you. I am honored to even know you. By being who you are you have taught me so much. lol, it is still hard for me to believe that we are together, just because it was something that I wanted so badly and things never had really worked out the way I wished they would. I am so incredibly happy that this has worked out and I pray that nothing changes it. Thank you for being in my life. Rils- From just starting to talk in the 8th grade to where we are now has been amazing. Our friendship literally just seemed to grow and grow. I have done some pretty dumb things, but you saw through them and stuck by me. That means so much. Bowling, the Hippodrome, World Civ, ridiculous movies, Spanish, Chemistry, English, lunch, sleeping over, freezing my ass off, just everying. We have had so much fun, and our friendship means so much to me. I am so glad that you know that you can call me anytime and that I will be there to help you. And thank you for helping me. Marie- the morning rides lol. You catch me at just about every main point in my day and my mood can basically be determined and altered by our talks. In the morning when I am in a poor mood we are usually able to turn it into a joke that we are able to look back at and laugh about. Especially our graves lol. We have this uncanny way of being able to relate to each other, and you always understand me. Thank you for helping me through, and helping me to remember to smile and laugh. Brittany- who probably does not read this, I am sorry for not really mentioning you much earlier, but you also mean a lot to me. Since 4th grade we have had one of the oddest relationships that friends can have. But that is just the characteristic of it. The point is, that we always end up back as friends. FIRST, student hosts, the dreams, the sleepovers, odd food mixtures, movies, becoming who we are together. Thank you for coming back, listening to me, and showing me a good time. Well, aren't (stupid conjunctions, I avoid them as much as possible and then I get a situation like that) I being incredibly sappy? Like I said, I realized a good amount of things today. Perhaps I needed it. I think I have said enough for one difficult evening. And I am feeling better. Please have a good day or night. -J9
Well, Jen said she was going to try to call me today and see if she couldn't work something out with her boyfriend and her brother so we could do hang out on the pike. I do not even know if Robbie has his car back or yet :-\. If Jen cannot get ahold of him I have no idea how I am supposed to lol. I really need to store her phone number in my phone so that I stop getting so confused when she calls me. I think she is the "Jm" in my phone that I forgot who it was. lol, too bad I have no idea what her last name is. She is wicked cool people though. Anways, it was either to wait for her call...or find people who were around now to go spend the day/evening with. So far, I have found a few people...I guess they were actually waiting for me to call since they were not sure when I would be back from SATs (which sucked really bad, by the way. The math section on this one sucked. I am nowhere near as confident on this one as I had been in Windsor Locks). So, maybe we'll chill for the day and if Jen calls me the night will be reserved for them. I need to survive on $15. Crap. Not good. I need a job which barely requires for me to be there. Maybe I will only buy a colatta this afternoon and I will pay for it in change giving me the illusion that I saved money lol. Meh, I have about 15-20 minutes before I have to head out on my walk to meet them. I was going to try to make myself reorganize my room some more. It is not going to be done until we have that tag sale, because there is too much stuff in my room and I hate the clutter like that. I would so much prefer if it were barren. I could have sworn that there was more that I wished to write in. :-\ Poo. Anyways, question: Who have I actually told from LiveJournal that I moved here? Please comment just so that I know. I know about four poeple who read this for sure but I just want to check. Thanks muchly! That works for that anyways. Arg, I know that there is something that I am forgetting. ::checks handy-dandy planner, crosses out yesterday, for it is one more day survived:: Well, there is nothing listed. I have no idea. I think that I was supposed to call my mom though. Whoops. There is always tomorrow. Okay, well, it is nearing time for me to head out. I shall talk to y'all later. Tycho, I hope you are having fun camping! Sorry about my sleeping last night! -J9
Well, today was decent enough. English - pop quiz on Macbeth which I got a 92% on. One 8-point question wrong. Precalculus - Panaccione went off on a tangent about having dreams the whole class. Study - made more applications for Aces High Spanish - listened to a presentation bu group 1. Slept through most of it actually. Chemistry - couple of worksheets with Rils. Pretty basic. History - wrote a letter with Rils in Miss Sjodin's defense and slept through Hitler movie. WDhen I got home I took a shower and came into my room for an hour long nap in the sunshine. It was nice, and much needed. Woke up to a call from friends to hang out earlier in the evening. I walked down to Dunkin Donuts and got a strawberry colatta (spelling?) then we left for the Holyoke mall. I ended up buyig a new DKM CD and belly button ring. Fun stuff. They bought the William Hung CD which also had a DVD so we listened to it all the way back to their house and then watched the DVD. William Hung is actually a pretty mean dude. It was funny. We plan to bring it to Battlecry. ::sigh:: Battlecry... As I was getting dropped off I was finally struck with the best part of my day every day. A call from Tycho. :-D I'm so glad that we got to talk. I miss you!!! Also, I do not know if I should take offense to this or not: Slickknick2001: wat kind collage u want to get in Jaenen6: Law/Business college Jaenen6: Western New England Slickknick2001: oh great u make a great lawyer lol Well, SATs bright and early tomorrow. Heads up for the longest weekend for me EVER. Not only do I have to wait for it to be over, I probably can't talk to Tycho. I hope he enjoys himself immensely and that I will be able to hear fun stories later on. Enjo everything you do! -J9
Well, after my last update I walked to Denslow aka Cemetary Park and sat on the swings for a while. I even sat through a brief rain shower. There were some rather contemptuous girls there, who oddly enough had British accents. I was a bit confused. All good though. After that I began the walk to the high school. The air was a bit chilled, but the walking was pleasant enough. About 2/3 the way there this purple van pulled over and I saw my friend Mark aka "Shmarky" stick his head out and ask if I would like a ride the rest of the way. I accepted, and then felt bad because now I haven't walked enough. I was grateful of the lift none-the-less. The concert went well, everyone performed well. One soloist went a little bit too freestyle, however, and it wasn't his best idea ever. Hmmm, foot is asleep again. After the concert, April aka Rils - her grandparents gave me a ride to Friendly's with them and got me dinner. Buffalo Chicken Wrap. Yum. A lot of people were there and it was a lot of fun. Thank you so much Rils. It was great. School tomorrow, Senior Skip Day. Should be nice. Hopefully it will go quickly, although nothing is going to be swift enough until I see Tycho again. Finally figured out a date for all of that too, good thing lol. Talked about a lot tonight actually. No clue what is going on tomorrow night, but since Tycho is going to be out I should probably find some way to preoccupy my time. There is always someone I can find to chill with. Well, I was originally going to keep this short but that never tends to happen so I will end this here. Have a good night/morning/day/evening lol. -J9
Woke up on time for once this morning lol, that's a good way to start the day. First period my precalculus teacher embarrassed me a good bit by singling me out and saying, "Did everyone know that Janine was such a good speaker? She did such a good job, you are a very good speaker..." Suuure, increase my ego some more there Panaccione. There are a few things that people can say to really make me feel pretty good about myself and expand the ego, and that is one of them. Second period, more talk of potentially making an appearance in court. Luckily, the school gave up. Worked some more in the technology department ... where I found out that Shannon, Rils, Paula (who didn't really need to take it in the first place), and I get to skip the final for Contemporary American Issues. YAY!!! I get out at 9:45 instead of noon that day because of that! Third - Study hall I made applications and announcements for Aces High...how very productive of me. Fourth - Spanish, signed yearbooks. Lunch, sitting there as usual...and then my bag started vibrating across the table. At first I just thought that it was a text message but it kept buzzing so I look at it to see "Tycho Main Calling". I didn't answer quick enough so I hit "Call" and put the side of my head to my bag. I was pretty worried. After I found out that it wasn't anything bad I calmed down and was really happy to have talked to him in the middle of the day. The bad thing was I had not told of my friends about Tych because I did not see the reason to just come out and say it out of nowhere. Now that he has found out a while after the fact he probably feels betrayed and is a little upset with me. It happened like that before in a similar situation. I felt like shit after that. Fifth - Chemistry - Mr. Pease got suspended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How horrible is that? I am fricken devastated. It is so unfair to him, he is such an awesome guy. :-( Sixth - History - Video on Hitler. Now I think I am going to head out for a walk to distract myself from being hungry. My cell will be on and with me. Music department concert at 7:00pm at the high school. I think that I am going to go to that. My cell will still be on during, but I won't answer right away. If I get a call I'll give a quick call back during an intermission. Well, talk to y'all later! -J9
Today started off in one of the most interesting manners ever! But first, I must tell you about a time that I planned to take a two hour nap. From about 6:30PM-8:30PM. I set the alarm on my cell to wake me up, and did it correctly, however, it did not go off. This made me iffy on the status of my phone. I can't really remember when Tycho and I went to sleep, but I know it was after 3. Ihad planned to wake up at 6:15AM to get decked out for the assembly. Well, this morning I snapped awake and without putting my glasses back on, checked the time. I saw 6:45AM, which meant that I had 10 minutes to get ready and go. Even the clock in the kitchen seemed to say so. I rush around and book out of the door. Once I got to Marie's I was confused to see her garage door shut. I then figured that it would be best if I walked back out to the bus stop. I get back there and finally pause to look around. It was dark-ish, no construction workers were out, and my neighbor was not home yet. Very odd. I look at the time on my cell phone again only to find that it read 6:03AM. Without my glasses, I thought for sure the 5 was a 6. Oh well. The senior assembly was postponed because Mr. Czarnecki was late. Once it finally started it was awesome as usual. Rils and I even got in the show. There was a pciture of the two of us at prom in the senior slide show lol. Shattered dreams? No? Oh well. Our assembly started a bit late, but I was decked out in my scally cap, duct tape vest, gold medal from BAE, and button belt. Caution tape as well. I went through school like that :-D Brian had blue hair and his lab coat. We got to show two movies and did our speeches. The attendance was awesome. We also recruited a lot of new members! I now have a project of setting something up for them at the Aces High summer picnic. Which reminds me, I have to see if Tycho would like to accompany me to that... After the assembly I spent half of my next class helping to put things away. Once I got to class, I collapsed on the floor and that was it. I remained there the rest of class. 5th period I blew through a lab very quickly so that I could finish it and sleep. Which I did some more of. 6th period, we had to accompany our teacher to the sophomore class officer elections. I slept through that too. Got on the bus...slept. Got home, checked on my dad who is doing great, went into my room...and slept. Went to meeting, same old same old. A member from Techno Wizards 809 may be joining us because their team may no longer exist. Emhart is pulling out of Enfield which would take away their main sponsor. LEGO told the Lego Maniacs basically to go fuck themselves. Not in that terminology, but team 96 no longer has sponsorship either :-( Well, I am going to go chat now and wait to hopefully talk to Tycho tonight. Later all. J9
Okay, now that I am done with the bullsh little Livejournal entry I can finally done some real writing. And quick thanks to those Livejournal users who now stray from their friend's pages to read my life here lol. Today went by much more quickly than most days. Usually I can tell when it is the last class of the day, but today I was ready for one more. With that extra energy, Jennie and I walked home making fun of the demographics of our town. lol, I could not think of the word "demographic" so I went out into my kitchen and gave its definition and right away my brother Jon pops up and says it. My other brother Ben just looked at him and started with the, "Haha, Jon is a bookworm!". I thought it was kind of funny. I asked him what it made me since I was looking for the word in Jon's defense. I did not stick around for the response. I did not want to know. I need to walk or something, hearing about the "hott chicks" at robotics totally slaughtered any self confidence that I had today and I really feel as though I need to do something about it. Arg, stupid bad weather. ::looks at watch impatiently, waiting for 8:45pm to roll around:: I am looking forward to the two assemblies that I have tomorrow. One is for the seniors, then the rest of the school joins in. It is a slide show of pictures and memories for seniors...they play sad songs...speeches I think. This is one of the big things I had been looking forward to in High School: In the auditorium, each class has their own section and it moves across the establishment. I believe that it is Freshmen - Seniors - Juniors - Sophomores. Well, after this assembly, the seniors leave for their senior outing and the order changes. Juniors bump up into the Senior position and are welcomed as the WLHS's newest graduating class. It is awesome and extremely symbolic...which is great for me as seeing that symbology is a big focus for me. Sentimentally n'such. So, looking forward to that. Then, the Aces High assembly where I get to do a lot of public speaking...on stage...with a microphone!!!!!! I also get to do a bit of competition-wear and attitude for the day. It will be fun. Robotics rarely ceases to make me happy. The only time it did not was when a person who was unafiliated was giving me a hard time and now that was a long time ago. Now, I get robotics and Tycho to look forward to :-D I also wish to apologize to anyone who tried to talk to me before the middle of 2nd period today. My mood was very foul and I should not have acted in the manner that I did. The tech department, Riso, and thinking better of the situation on my mind brought me out of it and as most of you will notice had me back to normal by lunch. Extremedies breaking off...hmph. :-P lol Anyways, as Rils said to me earlier today "Sorry about my verbal diarrhea..." That is pretty gross huh? I was amused. Talk to y'all later, hopefully some sooner than others. Take care! -J9
Once Your Sneakers Throw You (to Something Corporate and Pepper Ann. I have my reasons.) Here I am. That’s what he said. It’s a foggy night. The mist burns my eyes. It’s a long way down. Are you sure about this? Once your sneakers throw you, You forget how to fly. Don’t you wish You were still a little kid? Now what have you got to show? Superman doesn’t rescue suckers. Just so you know.
Matthew’s Town (In the style of Anne Carson...I have gotten a lot of praise on this one, as old and as simple as it is. Then again, words never really age and it is pretty complex now that I think about it. Anyway, it seems to have been a favorite so check it out.) She has never looked better. He decides. She is beautiful. Golden braids. Sunny night. He smiles as she. Sleeps. She never liked him anyway. She’s in. His bed.
A Love Song from Andy (An old school poem of mine...) Today, she asked me if I liked him. Where’s his lighter? His blonde hair? You look so cute together. Too bad you don’t know how To hold hands. Need a hand? Wow, thanks for the necklace. I do like chocolate milk. I’m glad you agree. And now, I can see him Three doors down. As he approaches– I know. I know. I know. He’s yours. He’ll ask me again, Then provide me with the hug. The one you wanted. I’m sorry. Excuse me for a minute, While I go throw up. Hold this for me. Too bad you don’t know how To hold hands.
A Chrysalis Catharsis (For Matt) How am I supposed to pull this off? This whole, perfect girl thing? How am I going to stay your butterfly– your baby bat? I’m none of that. Neither are you, that’s what I like about you. But I can deal with change. I breathe change. But will you love everything I’m changing back into? I’m crawling back into my chrysalis and morphing from your butterfly into a caterpillar. One of those prickly ones. My leathery wings are tearing. . .
Written and Revised on Christmas Day 2003. For Vinnie, who may be the only person to ever have heard what's written between these lines. Something is being held out to me by the hands that have cradled me for so long. I’ve been standing on my own two feet for the last six months or so. And still I can’t lift anymore weight than the little I am. To take it would, in a way, lighten my load. (For the moment) But as all time, that moment would soon slip away. (Losing my balance.) Then I’m burdened with the aftershocks and consequences and the Did that really happen? and the grin, and the dot. dot. dot. and the Goodbye. and the Hello. and the Yes, I screwed this over. and the Goodbye. (For good.) Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. I think it would be easier, not to kiss the hands that I feed from, but rather, to bite them. Sink my teeth in. Sip. Sip. Sip. And I’ll chew on the bones like the dog I am. I’m savoring all of this, you know. Though this has cost me the sweetest, (ripest) fruit, your juices fit better on my tongue. (Always.) And now those hands pick me apart, slip in under my skin. Tearing off pieces of my face and placing them in my hand. Am I really that cold? If I drop myself will that lighten my load? (For good.)
My Artificial Night I can see why Juliet loved her Romeo. I would have wooed him, too and made him forget the name Sweet Rosaline and taken the blinds and the curtains and drapes and created my own artificial night as he wooed and I wept and wanted him back. (Maybe I should put my armor back on.)
White Boy "All he could think about was, I'm too young for this. Got my whole life ahead. Hell, I'm just a kid myself. HOW AM I GONNA RAISE ONE?" -Kenny Chesney White boy. Bright flame. Stab yourself. Take the blame. The cocoon is torn, new wings emerge. Broken and spit-on, bruised by the urge. The flame will pour from between the lips of the boy with the chains and the womb with the whips. And the tip of the tongue begins to bleed. The blood is dirty. The flame will feed upon the skin under which he crawls. He tries to run. He trips. She falls. Never born can never fly. Nothing tastes good once you lie. Slowly learning how to die. Holding hands with a burning butterfly.
(I'd dedicate this one to my Mom...though she'll never know.) This is the borderline of crying. No, this is crying. Why do you insist on tugging the tears from me till I’m empty? And still trying to suppress my anger. The rage that I’ve been keeping bottled up for so long. I’d love to drown you in it, spill it all over your body– your soul–that little round glowing orb. I’d love to smother it with poison so it shrivels up and wilts like those fucking flowers on that fucking wreath where the dartboard used to be. I’m sorry I didn’t have perfect aim. I’m sorry I ever started this game. YOU ASKED ME TO PLAY! Well fine. I’ll never let you win again. (Gulping down my bottle of regret, now.)
Suspension (of the Senses) This is the chorus of the song Greg is creating for me :-D. This is me in the school cafeteria, standing, being pulled up onto the table by you. This is not a suspension (but of my senses.) This is my petition– signed by two: Me and you.
(For Mike. Obviously.) I hope you choke on every kiss She plants square on your lips. I hope that when you try to swallow them down, They get stuck in your throat. (Still kissing frogs?) And never again will you be able to taste Anything so sweet (as your lies) As me… Not to mention the kisses that are killing you softly, Breathing all your air. God, I hate being right. Especially when you knew all along But still pretended I was wrong. God, I hate your frog-digesting, kiss-infected guts. Go ahead and leave again. And this time, It won’t be you I’m lusting after. Bastard. I’ll be sitting here (Type. Type. Type.) creating my angry teenage poetry. Punching walls And punching keys. And you’ll be out there, Somewhere, Or better yet, IN. In everyone you come across, Including Jess– Your best friend. I love the was you talk about How you’re so close When the space between you Is bigger than you think you are. When you finally get together And kill that thing called SPACE, Let me know How much SPACE you allowed for between your bellies, Between your thick skin. So yes, you’re once again IN. How does it feel? I bet it’s mighty satisfying, With a small side of regret. And with one more girl, That will lust after you. And maybe a few more angry teenage poems.
Ashes Your fingertips glide Along the valley that is my stomach, Any my entire body cringes. Nerves explode. I ignite. (You are amazing.) This blazing fire Brightens the room. At first all I see is desire. At first all I see is want. But I look again. I see time. Regret, maybe, that crumples time.
Just Just slit my wrist And in you slip– Under my skin. You like tickling me from inside, don’t you? Don’t you like playing in the pools of my hot blood? (I’m hot for you.) Just change this. Just change me back from North to South. Repel me. (I thrive on your attraction.) I’m not as bipolar as I thought I was. I’m just like a lovesick puppy, following you around. (Maybe I’m just sick.) Just purr, Because, Kitten, us dogs, we don’t. Nuzzle against me, Rumble my chest. Stir up my blood. Let’s just make this up as we go along. Let’s just.
To My Mind Night is creeping along your back. (Like black ants in their track. In their line.) Soon it will shadow you, Shelter you completely. The darkness grows and grows, And soon I’ll lift it up, Let a little beam of light Blind you for a split second. I’ll crawl underneath the sheets with you, And you’ll wrap your shadow-stained arms (Pale now, more pale than ever.) Around my middle. (Tightly now, more tightly than ever.) There are cobwebs gathering in the corners here. Where was I all your life? Eventually some of me Will leave my body, Numbing the nerves I’ll no longer own. Eventually everything of mine that you’ve endured Will leave even you. (After X number of years). Memory is everything. Lick me all over, Taste everything, Even my memory. Kiss all the places where you’ve licked my skin away. (Mend me.) I’ll lose myself to you. I’ll give you the egg And you be the fetus. You do the math. (The addition To our family.) Our family itself. I’m still leaving through the slits On my wrists. Like an adulteress though her window. (Back to her lacy spider web. Tie me up now, tie me up more tightly than ever.)
Due Time pt. II (for Patt) I want you to know that my mind is like a magnet and you’re the refrigerator door. That weird texture to you– I’d like to run my fingers along it, as it melts and twists into the shape of your face. My fingers brush your pink lips, like an A on a test paper, stuck up on the fridge– Triumphant. but not too proud. Something someone has earned. Something someone has to show what they have learned. Your lips are my teachers, and I crave knowledge, wisdom. Happiness. (Can that be taught?) Keep speaking! I want to know everything! I want you to show me. I want a little red A to kiss. I want you.
::Kink:: (for Indie) Pulling the hair from my head, Cocked sideways. I hope to God I don’t get a kink In my neck Without Harry around. Pulling the hair from my head. I think… India Wright You’re really something. ::Kink::
Sloppy Seconds (The Long Kiss Goodnight) Is this my long kiss goodnight? Because my lips are left alone. Resting unparted and untouched. Is this what I’m left to live with? And sleep with? This phantom that won’t touch me? I’ve always thought that those memories come back to life for the better. Well I guess I was wrong cause nothing is worse than this enticing nothing. The leftovers of a venomous kiss. What if I don’t want sloppy seconds? I don’t know. Maybe I’m overreacting. But you gave me reason to in giving me nothing at all.
This one's becoming a song thanks to Greg (:-D) so look out for it. She can wear a white shirt like nothing’s ever been so white. Like nothing’s ever been so sexy. Her hair falls in all the right places, curling on it’s way down her back, like water trickling over rubies. As succulent, as red and the apple that Eve plucked and polished and ate. …her tool for sin… …her tool for sin… Walking beside her while she glows with all my energy In her whites and her blacks. She makes me feel so ugly, so plain and boring and dusty. So unclean and unwanted, I try a little spit-shine, to maybe catch all the Adams’ eyes. It’s not that they don’t see me. It’s not that they don’t look me up and down. It’s just that she’s so much better at being a girl.
Closure (From Here on Out) (for Mike...that's right, MIKE.) From here on out, my every heartbeat will be devoted to someone else. From here on out I dedicate myself to a worthier cause. To a cause that’s not engaged; and from here on in, my heart will be sealed with a juicier kiss. A kiss that will inspire more than lustful feelings. From here on out I’ll remember the difference between a breath and a scream and that they both ran out of ecstasy.
Aye, Pilgrim! At least I said Goodnight tonight before I said goodbye. God I love the way you nuzzle the air as if someone was there when I scratch your head and play with your hair. But, Love, I must admit Love isn’t Love unless we can handle this shit. We have knots to comb out, we have rough lips to smooth with Romeo’s Holy Palmer’s kiss. Aye, Pilgrim! God I love the way you sin and the trouble you always get us in. Too bad I still hate everything.
Kiss Space (To “Brian that Guy”) I don’t know what it was exactly. Something about lacing myself all up all over. And what? Did I actually think that I could be all over you? Because I’m pretty sure my fingers were still laced through his. Woven. [Kiss space] I liked how you kissed me on the cheek and how you planted the kiss more in that empty space between my cheek and my neck. Only a fool allows a stranger to kiss her (neck). Well, I guess then, Stranger, I’m foolish. Play with me again, Stranger. Help unwind these bindings To him, My everything. (Unravel) (Me)
Indestructible and Sweet (to Vampire) It’s sweet Like raspberries and orange juice. Like how you can call me Princess and get away with it. Like plucking the petals from a flower, thinking, Please let him love me! How can he not? Maybe every flower wasted on wishes and worried little girls will come back and haunt you. (Boo…BOO!) At least when you wish on stars (like me) we’re not wasted and scattered around your feet. It drives me insane when you poke at mine. I’m as ticklish as sin. Just as I am invincible. Us stars, we shoot (through the sky) LIKE THE CRY OF A PISTOL. Nothing’s as convincing as the point of a pin and the wiry tree I can scratch into the palm of my hand, when I’m hiding in the corner where no one can find me. I’m invisible. I’m indestructible and sweet Like raspberries and orange juice. Like a star’s defeat.
Is it raining in California? (Just the chorus of a really long song I've been working on for a while... oh yeah and this one is for Ant, too.) Is it raining in California or clear enough to see our moon? Are you surfing over crashing waves or sitting silently on the roof? Thinking of me, and the way it was before... surface on the shore wash up to my front door I'll dry you off and wrap my arms around you. We can make out in the Massachusetts rain. Let's run away.
A Million Miles (for Ant, wherever you are) A million miles A gazillion footsteps away I’ve never ever cared so much~ I’ll never forget the way we made out on the rooftop under the white hot moon. MXPX playing in through the window to my room– A love song about two people A million miles (a gazillion footsteps) away from each other Both in the dark curled under the covers giggling out loud in the night. The echoes of the beeping when the text messages came through. (Nothing better to do.) (There is nothing better than you.) Two people- Shaking with anticipation Wishing they could just wrap themselves in someone else’s arms (and lips). But still I’ll never forget how I’d sit on the rooftop listening to MXPX play softly in my ear Looking at the same moon that you were looking at, too.
Inhale (for Mark) Written and Revised March 28, 2004 I want to inhale him all, my little cigarette. He soothes my blood, his mystery fills my lungs and I'm already addicted. I fit so perfectly like lock and key– he opens me. I want to hug him forever and soak all his toxins in, my little cigarette. He turns me on, I light him up, and everything's fine. I miss him so much. I need another drag so I can sit still. One more kiss from the lips of my little cigarette. Fighting these cravings, God, do I crave him. Friends like a thousand surgeon generals screaming from the pages of magazines and time. But I'll inhale him all. He's mine. My little cigarette.
Grey Grey Actor and Other Grey Things Written and Revised April 1, 2004 There actually are more than fourteen shades of grey. And though I still don't know for sure what grey matter is, I'm sure my body is covered in it. I'm sure it's multiplying by the minute. After attending a musical I curl up with my grey. After attending a musical starring all my friends– the stars–little grey stars-–my friends being stared in the eye so straightly by a silver-eyed, brown-haired actor. Humor emits from his ears and his eyes– he doesn't blink, Why won't he blink? Grey matter in his mouth Grey matter on his cheeks. I'm sure it's been multiplying for weeks. A grey grey actor soiled costume, disheveled brown-hair brown-hair and grey-eyes grey-eyes stare. stare. WHY WON'T HE BLINK? I still don't know for sure what grey matter is but it peels away at his eyelids and leaves me grinning like an idiot and I blush– I'm sure my blood is silver, too, though I'm no unicorn. No magician. No actor. Just a grey little girl lost in a moment wondering why wondering what any of this even has to do with the color grey.
Mad Season/In Your Mouth (The Fuck Yourself Poem) Written 4.2.04, Revised 4.3.04 (and again...take it as you will...) I'll bleed all over you then try not to look while you fuck yourself. The sound of water rumbling in the pipes inside the wall– you washed a little bit of liquid-me and whatever else– flint rocks flint rocks Fucking stop it! You're sparking me. You're sparking me! Masturbation is a silly thing like bleeding in someone else's mouth without warning. ( I'm sorry! I swear I didn't know! ) I'm not listening. I promise I don't feel a thing. I'll try and think of something else: F is for Flint Rocks. U is for You, You, You, You. So many things that start with C- Creation. ( Oh, please, GOD. NO! ) I'd beg. Castration. that spot on the wall that spot on the wall At least your room isn't excruciatingly green-blue (69 69) At least your room isn't lined with too many trophies. That's all I ever used to be... all of this is making me feel like maybe I should help, I should obey. oKay. oKay. (I let you win...)
"I'll never doubt again." -Buttercup, The Princess Bride (^I think this is going to be the title of this poem. It is kind of...um...controversial is the word I think I want. Take it as you will, it is art and art is only how it is interpreted.) Written 3.1.04, Revised 4.4.04 I can't every be you I wouldn't fit into your shoes. (My feet are too small... Maybe all of me is too small...) But I have an idea. Let's switch bodies for a while– Let's be inside each other in more ways than one. You can play the stepfather I am so much afraid of In my own silly way and rape me. Give me something new to give a rebirth to my wallowing in and maybe you can baptize new faith while you're laying all tangled up in our own skin, fair and thin, and never doubt again. Maybe I can make it easier– for a while anyway. We're both safe under the sheets drowned out by these screams. And you won't have to love me. And I won't have to walk anywhere in your shoes. I like it right here where we are, doubtful.
Darling Nicky Written 3.28.04, Revised 4.5.04 The boys and girls are out tonight. They unbutton blouses. They unzip flies. They take off shoes. They turn off the light. The glimmering creatures are full of lies. They are eating each other. They are overfed. At night, alone, I marry the bed. -Anne Sexton "The Ballad of a Lonely Masturbator" Do you like having control, Nichole? Do you like to be able to choose how he smells? of coffee or smoke or grass or mint? Do you miss all you fell for when you fell in like? All that you secretly loved about him– the little things he changed to entertain you? Now I bet it just pains you to watch his trenchcoat drag along in the dirt. So Nichole, Did it hurt when it hit you that what you're kissing today has cured the delicious virus of yesterday?
Revised 4.5.04 (For Jake...you're welcome.) A kitchen filled with a thousand roses– nothing to be jealous of nothing to be jealous of Save one for me, I'll do anything, please. Just make me feel special. Petals of attention, sprinkled with dew drops of salt from your lips. Nothing to be jealous of, Nothing to be jealous of. Okay, you can keep the petals, JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING! I'll take the stem. The leaves, whatever. As long as it's from you. Call me tomorrow when you get home from working– selling a thousand roses. and remind me nothing to be jealous of nothing to be jealous of I though you were a safety net. Scratch me with the thorns. I thought you were a safety net. I could hang my halo on your horns. Anyway, I'm no cherub. And there were no sparks flying. NOTHING to be jealous of, like I'd be jealous of a couple sparks...
Written on 3.1.04, I felt like if I revised it even the slightest bit I would lose something, so this is the original version and the way it will stay. This is one of my all-time favorites, along with Due Time pt. II . If I had to dedicate this poem to anyone, it would be to the bricks in the wall in that spot in my school that I love. . . The drumline is pounding. POUNDING! and still somehow it's so serene. It's been an eternity without a drop of sunlight to baptize me. But I'm fine now. I'm okay. The psychobabble seems to sway the way I dressed and set my eyes. I'm sitting where TJ kissed me. Where he wrapped his arms around my middle and lifted me up by the hips and I wrapped my legs around his middle, and held tight. His goose down coat, I thought I was tangled in a cloud. But I was tangled in a liar. I remember feeling the warm metal of the ring through his lip, pressing ever so softly against mine. (We could have pierced our lips together and have been fine!) But the beating had resided and I'm sitting on the dusty floor, the bricks holding me where he did. Even though we both knew it wouldn't last somehow I'm satisfied with the little things like lip rings and clouds and bricks. Somehow I'm satisfied with the past.
Written 12.10.03, Revised 4.5.04 (I actually wrote this in a McDonalds...) I can feel the pressure building up behind my eyes. I don't know if it's tears, or blood, or brains, or what. But my pupils feel pierced by a little gauge. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Burst. Spin. Spin. Spin. Back to feeling fine. Towel dry. Try to hide. Everything. Shovel it all back inside. Chew. Swallow. Chew. Swallow. Eating pride. (So this is what my ego tastes like...)
Written 3.21.04, all the appropriate revising was done in the writing process. I have yet to title this poem, which I actually wrote when I had that retarded Nickelback song in my head. Yes this is word-for-word my own. Yes this is word-for-word for MIKE: I love your collarbone. I love the way you fall asleep on the phone. I love the scratches on your arms. I hate all your little hidden charms. I hate that damn Nickelback song. I love that you still think I'm wrong. I'd love to suck the salt from your wounds. I hate your Anime cartoons. I love the way you're way too white. I love that you hold me so damn tight. I love the way that your lips curl. I love the way you make me HURL. I hate the way you smell my hair. I love the way you never care. I love the neck I hate to bite. I LOVE YOU PIST OFF WHEN WE FIGHT. I love the way you have control. I hate how much of me you stole. I love the way you make me cringe. I love that love is just a binge. I love the smell of your sweat. I hate the day that we met. I love the way I'm just your pet. I love all the rules that you set. I hate the way you get me high. That sexy green ring in your eye. I hate the Godess that you praise. I love that I was just a phase. I love the dullness of your teeth, the way you nibble underneath the thin blonde layer of my hair. I hate that nothing's ever fair. I hate all the thoughts that you think. I love your promise not to drink while you sneak another sip. I hate the way you bite your lip. I love that you refuse to cry. I love that you don't bother to try. I love that you're waiting for your wings. I love that there are no 'little things.' I love the way you crack your neck. How you're just in this for the sex. How you walk so fucking fast. All the dark secrets in your past. I love to watch you bruise and bleed. I hate the veins from which you feed. I love the ground that you walk on. I hate that you always sleep through dawn. I love the grave you've dug for me. I love your limp, your fucked up knee. I love the pockets of your coat. that you're a castle, I'm your moat. I love the fingers that you cross. I love the way that you're the boss. I hate the softy underneath. I love to forget to remember to breathe. I love that "I'm sorry" doesn't count. I hate that I don't even amount to the Sapphires in her eyes. I love that you also leash up guys. I hate how everything's the same. I love when you act so goddamned tame. I love the knowlege in your head. I love the tears you make me shed. I hate the way you let me in. I love the thickness of your skin. I love the way I clench the sheets every time that your cold heart beats. I love that I'm still seduced by you. I hate the way I was one of two. I love when you jack off on the phone. I love your collarbone.
I'll Make it to Hell (The Beholder) July 27, 2003 To Erin, though the original version is for Greg Jarry, after it had undergone revisions and I built structure (that's right, I used STRUCTURE) I altered it to tell a different kind of story...for Erin. It's so cliche that I may cry, but what it crying versus death? What devil is this that tattoos his Hell With my every choking breath? Another night I lie awake, My face is masked by dark. My eyelids are heavy, my fingers are numb, And my still body is stark. I’m safe within these four walls, But Edgar Allan Poe once said: ‘That any beholder Might fancy me dead.’ The beholder thinks she’s ugly, Unless the mirror lies. And on this 27th of July, This damned beholder dies. But there’s one angel Who seeps through these walls. I’ve never thought of this one angel, As one whom cares at all. I’ve always thought of this angel as The goofy kid in the back of the class that ive known since third grade. And though this isn’t a tale of his rescue, The sadness inside me began to fade. And when I turned to pay respects to the boy who saved my life I had to look away. Any beholder aside from myself Would sneer with dismay. But now I think I know the truth. This angel simply lied. As I offered again to pass on his good deed, I could see it in his eyes. No tourniquet can stop this bleeding, Stop this hurt inside. Sometimes I hate the angel, too, But I know that at least he tried. Maybe I’ll be an angel, When this bleeding its through. I might regret the choice I made, But what else was I to do? So, my angel, I’m sorry for wasting your time. Maybe I’ll see you around. I’f im not up in heaven, I’ll make it to Hell before the stars shine down.
Serenade 1. I have 1.2.3.4.5. fingers on my hand. The bed is dripping off it's frame. My breath rolling over the surface of the phone like oil over water, all rainbow around the edges, slippery. That spectrum, seducing me. Myself is dried and peeling off of my fingers, like old, crumpled bark. Remember we had a tree? Remember it didn't like you? I like you-in 1.2.3.4.5. ways. You're the 'ow' in wow. You're the stains on my fingernails. I kinda sorta somehow... I kinda sorta somehow... I swear to you, my God again, PLEASE. Prove that it's not me, and that it's just my 1.2. hands. I'll kiss you like an ant kisses the sun when a magnifying glass is held over it. I hold you over everything- My 1.2.3.4.5. ways, My 1.2.3.4.5. I turn them over to you. My 1.2. hands in yours. I give you my sweat. I give you my pores. 2. As I turn on my heel to step into the shower, I catch a glimpse in the mirror of the little ink Star I drew on my ankle earlier with my hormone pen: you refill me. Only the Star, that's all I see, for, what is my ankle? what is the tile? My nothing bones see to be asking. Everything is just the background. Everything is turning brown. Left shining like a blacklight through the mud- that little Star, diggind it's 1.2.3.4.5. little thorns into my pores. 3. I step into the shower and let the hot water crash over me, like the oil of my melted screams. Like you. I findmyself unable to stand, losing balance. LOSING CONTROL. Clawing at the shower curtain trying to steady my weakening knees. Urine around my feet (goldplating the Star) RELEASE RELEASE Knocking down the rack of razors , white blood cells seeping through my gold, tattooed pores.
Written 3.1.04, I just uncovered it in a pile of old papers and I liked it a lot. So here is is: With a quick flick or my achy shaky wrist I can do anything– and I will. My magic wand, this ballpoint pen. I can create whatever I want. I can create perfection. And I will. A kittenlike girl with long dark hair and eyes that seem to hold me and lips that ask me to kiss them. And I will. Because I can do anything. And I will.
Kingdom Written 3.28.04, Revised 4.5.04 You have no idea. I'll be your queen, you can reign more than just your neighborhood. I can't believe that I am about to write this, but I'll be your kingdom.
Someone Please Just Kiss me Written 3.26.04, Revised 4.5.04 A simple hug used to soothe me. (I hate the world. I hate the world.) Inertia– Around and around and around I'd go. (I found you. I found you.) I think I found a world I don't hate. It's getting late but it's still so early. Do you appreciate me as much as I appreciate your mother sheltering my knocky-kneed smile, my kind story, and my confusion? Are you as confused as I am? You have nothing to fear, you are invincible, and I am so seduced. I guess maybe all this abandonment is only in my head. (Everyone loves me. Everyone wants me.) If you understand what I mean and mean what you say, someone, please just miss me. Someone please just kiss me.
In fear for Sam's Dignity Written 4.1.04, Revised 4.5.04 I fear ever walking into an empty arcade these days. Especially, I'm sorry Sam, I'm sorry Sam, if the punk in the powder blue polo shirt is anywhere near. I fear, for your well-preserved innocence. I fear for all the black makeup on your face. You are not the only victim, stay out of his way. It wasn't a dream. Run, I swear. It wasn't a dream! I bled it, I felt it when you'd scream. When you'd scream. I would have surely been ripped back into this dimension when you'd scream, curdling my blood. The world in which he lies in wait behind a Street Fighting game, I think that is. It's red, it's red like the blood he'll tear you open and bathe his- skin- in you're pooling scarlet mess. It doesn't matter how dark your clothes. You better run. I promise you this. Stay out of his way– more blood. more pain. more time thinking "IS MY SKULL SHATTERED YET?! I'M SCREAMING SO LOUD WHY WON'T ANYONE LISTEN?? IS ANYONE THERE?? SOMEONE PLEASE!!! COME FUCKING SAVE ME!!! HELP ME, SOMEONE!!! anyone."
Written and Revised 4.11.04 This is breathtaking. This made Amy cry. She read the rough draft. She had tears streaming down her face. Maybe because it is about her and the child inside her, but it is still one of my absolute favorites. I read it back to myself and I was like...woah... There’s an angel in her womb, I can feel his weakness when I look at him. He’s buried under Layers of skin, sheets of Membrane. His bones are so thin, his Eyes never open. He is Nameless, he has that advantage. He has not yet been numbered, Though he has been labeled, Has been judged. The doctors say He’s too big to be true. But I know that’s just his wings all Tucked inside that embryo. The Umbilical cord is so thick, So his thoughts can get out. But Somehow they’re all just clogged Up in there. The doctors want To get him out. Everyone wants To get him out. But he’ll freeze. Plaster him in tiny blue clothes, Put booties on his feet, but The world is too cold. The world Is too cold. He needs a Hero like a blanket. He needs A childhood somewhere outside To thicken his bones and whiten His feathers. His eyes will open, And all the sights will close his Mind. Somehow I know that he’s Better off inside her. Somehow We’re all better off not knowing His name. All the years and Moments will take him over And he’ll find himself Under the mistletoe. His Aged lips kissing the host Of his own angel. Wishing That she’ll get to keep Her wings.
Written and Revised 4.11.04 Does she think I’ll be the one To wrap a blanket around her? Does she think that I’m the One who can smooth the Goosebumps on her skin? I’m Not there to play doctor or nurse. She wants a mother. She wants Someone to grow up for her So she can stay young forever. Does she think I’ll give my imagination, All my wit to her? Does she think I’ll Make her peanut butter and jelly Sandwiches and mix her chocolate milk At midnight when she can’t sleep? Does She think I’ll be her education? She’s Not much shorter than me. I can’t be All she can’t be.
Written and Revised 4.11.04 I thought it was about time I wrote something new for Jess. I actually really really like this peice. Everytime I read it over, my grammatical side says that it's really incomplete, but my writer side says that it's perfect that way. It adds to it. And anyway I still really like it a lot. Every time I crack my knuckles, The sound rings you into my head. The poofy Easter dresses of All the egg-hunting six-year-olds Crinkle when they squat down To grab an egg from underneath a Bush. It reminds me of the Sound of all those perfumes sprayed In the Greyhound coach. You came Home with me and I threw up Shrimp lo mein while you listened Through the wall. I’m never in the A forest anymore, it’s never serene. But the pencil in my sketchbook I remember you called that poem “Alone” when I was exploring only footsteps away. This little blister on the tip of my tongue rubs against the back of my teeth and I can see you in my head, fixing the makeup job-I wasn’t good enough because God forbid, anyone was going to see you that night. You have other friends names Meagan with 2 A’s and girls you always tried to hate because they dressed so differently, when really you shopped at the same stores. They giggled too much, you never ever Did. But when I giggle it’s fine. It’s fine Somehow. We used to believe in aliens. In 2012 will you still be breathing? Will you still ask for a nice ripe Piece of fruit when you’re feeling Slightly dry. You’d always crave. You keep D.C. waiting, when really You’re just waiting for a chance to Admit to yourself that you want to Strip him of all the white he wears And his perfect blonde hair. I thought You were getting married! I thought he Was your snowflake! (You published That notion, then went running to Your rock star mother and fed her The story of the year you were five. And she ate it all up and then burped It all out and you smiled.)
Written and Revised 4.11.04 When the subject of this peice comes across it, she'll know it's for her. I still can’t figure out why she let me Read through all her journals, read The scratches of her pen, forming Words of all the things she never had. Boys named Eric and Mike and Alex. Each one seems to be so stupid, yet They’re perfect targets to her aiming Love. She has all these feelings Swelled up in the bottom of her heart But they taste so sour, taste so chewed-up, Thick and sticky filth. No one will drink them Out of her. No one will let they’re tongues So near. She showers over and over And she still doesn’t know why no one Wraps their arm tight enough around her. Why all the kisses are just on her stomach And her cheeks. She doesn’t know. She just wants someone to absorb her, But she’s drenched in perfume. She’s just looking for her bull’s eye. But everyone is just so fucking square.
Written and thouroghly revised 4.11.04 This is for Egypt and I somehow know she'll understand. Always scrawling sad words on notebook paper. She’s shouting “READ ME”, though the letters Fall clumsily off her tongue. So instead she Swallows a pill, and listens to it slosh inside her. At lease it responds to this tan girl with tight curls and the heaviest world In her hands. She doesn’t understand that she is Turning, she is revolving around a universe of Lying suns and little cracking stars. Nothing is Real. All those feelings that she thinks she feels are Only the mercury spilling out of the center of the Broken stars. Dripping, dripping, like acid rain It melts the thickness of her skin and she’s so unsafe. I know that all she’s longing for is a hero…someone To save her soul. And all the stitches sewn across her Heart aren’t anything but creation. Her art. She Would give anything, anything to find a rescue, But she’s okay, she doesn’t need to be saved. Her Tight curls are hanging loosely now, and her makeup’s All smeared below her eyes. But I can see through them- A brain like a planet, but she just wants to have rings. She’s an angel who refuses to know she has wings.
This one has a nice strong start then dies because Steve came over and I lost it. (Actually I fixed the ending just now when I typed it, it's a bitty bit better) Oh yeah and if u mix kisser and killer is makes KILSER yeah! 4.16.04 And this is why people cheat. Because they can't walk away with what could have happened plastered all over the walls of their weak minds. If they'd kept it all up there then it would have been fine. And this is why people suffer. This is why people sometimes die inside because they can't live without indulgence. And I'm sorry I killed you. I'm sorry I tried to kiss you. I don't even know why you're reading these words. Everybody already knows that life is nothing but a scrapbook of moments, each skull is nothing more than a bulletin board stuck with million trillion tacks. It would have pricked me to kiss you but I pulled out the pin and killed you I guess. I am everybody now because I finally know that life is nothing without screwing up for that one unscrewed-up second. Maybe less. And this is why people exist. To follow these screwed-up guts that make up the killers and the kissers that whe are.
I just wrote this. For Sam. It has yet to be titled but I will title this one. Anyway, it's 4.16.04 and you can guess what (should have) went down. I think... I'm so confused because first it was me with my arm around someone and my eyes around another and it was Sam who sat with me on the cold ground while I wrote and wrote all the things I was thinking about the ferris wheel and the shadows and the way her lips fit nicely in her face. But I am lost in my own head, for I barely bothered to look up and watch her go by, spinning, spinning, like she does in my head. Sam was sitting right by me. Right there! I could reach out and touch her (I still don't know why I didn't.) And anyway she just wanted to be kissed. For someone to heal the scratches on her back. And though I am usually the one causing the marks I'd have kissed them better if it wasn't for the ferris wheel.
I'm missing her voice today. It makes me smile, the little neon lights in it. So I guess this is for the better. So I guess this is for the better. She hung the little cartoon I drew her next to her bed. Next to all the photos of the boys. And she tells me she'll kiss my wings and steal my devil but while she's in the shower she thinks of someone else.
Am I that bad a person that I steal from Jesus? because my stomach is so big and my eyes are so small? I woke up this morning and stretched out on my bed like a dancer and splashed in the silence until my sister cannonballs in, kisslips fir the dog to come, jingling collar, so I have to dry my brain off and go downstairs like a good little girl and eat.
And you say "thank you" before hanging up. I mean it when I say I could hold you forever as long as you wear your brown hair down. You have so many boys but I'll pretend they're not there and I'll kiss you if only on the side of the face and I'll smile. I'll oil you when you stiffen up in the prescence of a spider and I'll brush your wings if you ask me to. I'll place flowers in your hair so all the devils will smell you, so all the devils will envy you. All these things I will do for you if you just let me is. Become blind to those other boys and I'll say "thank you" before hanging up.
First she laughs out loud. "Everything is fine!" she exclaims, little flowers on her sea green maternity shirt. She just keeps laughing, like the world is so funny. Like the color of the walls were telling jokes. I slam another plate into the dishwasher, and she hands me the bottle of Ranch Dressing, and scolds me for not putting it away. And she laughs again, and turns to my father. She's got him wrapped aound her pregnant little finger, she thinks, and she cackles on. I wonder if the child inside her will develop these symptoms, these delusions of thinking that the world is stuck into her stomach like the needles she can't live without. The world is no bigger than the head of a pin. This is a funny thought, I know she is telling herself. I squirt dish soap and get some on the back of my hand and so it smells lemony-fresh for the rest of the night. I can't stop smelling my skin thought the scent disgusts me, and my father lies in my bed, rambling on about the moped he had when he was my age. I wonder if when I am his age I will find someone to impregnate with a laughing little angel, and be able to hear all the jokes from the walls.
Yes, this one is in Spanish. I had little use of a translator, because I actually am very good in Spanish. Anyway, if you understand it, you probably won't like it. So like it in Spanish, mysterious. ¿Le llamaré en otra lengua, pero si, usted contestará? ¿usted siempre de todos modos? Voluntad usted lleva a cabo mi mano mientras que pecado de yo y despluma las pocas plumas blancas pasadas de mis alas sucias sucias. (te amo.) amor de yo cómo se siente cuando usted los rasga de mí, cuando usted rasga fuera de todo el que importaba. Y le llamaré entre de mis labios asquerosos que se encrespan. Y usted contestará, Sé, o continuaré descomponiéndose.
Sour Sweet-Nothings Written in Greg's van, I was upset...well, I guess you could call it that... 4.24.04 you are my jewelry diamonds in your eyes– you cut me. you are my white blood cells my armor– you fight (for) me. you are embers– ashes of your complexion, falling. you blush in my prescence. you are my candy– sweet now, sour soon. puckering up... you are unknown in a maternity ward– even i don't recognize you here. you are the fingers you close around my ear and whispered into. you are a secret. you shouldn't have told me.
4.22.04 (You might not be able to make sense of it. Whatever.) Are you a dilemma, a disaster? I could forget you all together, You could come find me and kill me. You can keep writing me letters You can keep talking sweet, sweep me off my feet. But you're still only tripping me... again and again and again. You are the car when we're driving down the highway in the falling rain with the sunroof wide open. And you are the shadows, like bridges over the air. You are the urge to dance in front of my dad (the music is so perfect.) Everything is always just so perfect. Even when I fall on my face. Even when you come find me and kill me.
Nothing Exists... For Nick, who does exist... Written 4.21.04 One day you'll burst inside me, I read. Then you'll exist. Because every bomb wants to be embedded within the heart of a heartless bitch. And anyways, Joe and Anthony weren't explosives, they were nothing but morning glories, their vines wrapped around my heart. (Cat's Cradle with my veins.) I don't know who picked them, but they are still all tangled up inside me, and I'm hoping you can scorch them loose. Because no one exists as a person, nothing exists anymore– except this match... you scare me so much when I set you off.
I just found this like minutes ago and finished it. Kind of ehhhh-y. (I just made that up! YAY!) Ok. Bye. Sounds downstairs, the creak of the bathroom door. I imagine her broken water all over the floor. I imagine my aunt sleeping on the couch when we awake at noon. She was supposed to wake us for school. We should sit by the phone. We should sit by some lost patience. We are all just patients here. I imagine we can sit still. But none of this is real except these tears. No one knows how proud I'll be. If I can find a way to conquer these fears. I don't even know if I'll be afraid at all. I don't know how this will happen, I keep thinking as the darkness fades into another empty day. No patience. No doctors.
4.23.04 Ramblings-on about my newborn brother, Oliver. Written in the hospital room. I have never been so protective of anything in my life. I will shower him in safety, he no longer has his wings to hide behind. What will be his armor? His blanket? Coat and hat? Someday he will be someone's Prince Charming. Someone's knight in shining something great. Cradled now, carried by blood. He has a body now, carrying someone he will someday want to love. He wrinkles up his forehead and squeezes his eyes shut tight when something changes, when he isn't sure that something's right. He breathes so heavily. I can feel his itsy-bitsy stomach against mine. In and out. In and out he breathes, against mine. And everything's right. Everythhing's fine.
Corridors I wrote this in the hospital while I was waiting to go back in and see my newborn baby brother. My father took me for a walk down into the lower levels of the hospital. Damn, was it something. 4.23.04 The mirrors follow us as we walk down thin thin white corridors. The voices from behind the walls plead. Out of the corner of my eye, the bloodiest face on a stretcher, all stretched out and demented. These walkways are narrow, they almost swallow me whole. I think I'm going nowhere. Everyone walks by with a limp and an accusing look in their eye. I try to watch the tiles (I'm not guilty. I'm so unbroken.) and there is no dirt anywhere. I scan a vending machine, as my tomach turns over, for any sign of relief. But a father-again in scrubs and gloves turns his head and my eyes creep back to the floor, all stuttery and blushing. I know inside the walls are x-ray machines and wires and tubes. Ever since I was little, I never much liked hospitals, they give me the chills. They'd stitch me all up and fill me with candy, so I would stay sweet, but it all starts to rot. And my age turns around and I pull the threads out. Taking something more that just string, my sanity. (This isn't sanitary!) Narrow and winding I lose myself here. I don't know where I'm going and I don't much care. As long as I make it out without patches or scars. I want to stay this nervous, rotten wreck that I am. This thin thin corridor of a girl that they've made me.
Ladylike I wrote this on 4.25.04 in the middle of the night. I'm just a thin girl with a handfull of thumbtacks, one wishful thinker can't destroy the world. These are the thoughts that curl up at the base of my brain as I step down the carpeted stairs in the night. I don't know how to build a bomb. I could never get out of this burning building, I'd burn alive. Alive. Alive. (Am I still alive?) Women and children first- Women and children holding hands. It's not polite to put oneself first. These are the thoughts that cause the world to die. Burned alive.
Not liking this one much, feels a little too empty....but maybe it's just me. 4.26.04 My mind has already decided that it will make some room for you. Like the peircings in my ears, you can slip in in bewteen... A stud, but only on the outside. Your crystal. I still don't know how cold you feel when you're stuck through my ear, for my nerves are frozen over, like icicles of wires.
I wrote this while eating breakfast. Short and sweet. Fun fun fun. 4.26.04 Guzzle down a Coke with my morning dose. This pulse in my stomach, a thick heartbeat, as I sink my teeth into this buttery bagel. That's rain pounding down outside, isn't it? For just a moment, then it slows.
Rainbow or Chocolate? Written in the car with Lisa on 4.22.04, on our way back from the hospital at the Dairy Queen drive-up window. The head wouldn't drop down. The head wouldn't drop down. And so they slice her open. My eyes are so dark sapphire today. Mike knows what all of that means, for him, at least. For him. But is it fear? Are the jewels from the eyes of the fetus fallen into me? The cousins hungrily scarf down plastic cups of ice cream. They paint their lips in it.
4.21.04 Rambling... I think I believe in jinxes again. Actually, I never didn't believe. But good-looking waiters in good-looking shirts: (they're all so tall, they're all so red.) What's not to get? I'll stretch my light blue shirt around my shoulders a little more. And he vanishes into the kitchen. ~Gourmet What?~ It's like a movie, with the dishrag in one hand, and one of those grey pastic wash basins in the other. And the scene ends. Fade to black...(everything is red, everything is far too red.)
4.21.04 You are the minister, I am the chapel. (Can foundation pray?) You're alive only to bless me. My brothers and sister are the fingernails, their mouths, blackboards. (No lesson to be learned here.) You can't hide behind a pillow! I'm going to have a brother tonight. I'm going to have a brother tonight. To watch a pregnant wonan swing and to know that that baby has MY BLOOD . Their excited voices echo echo echo in the crisp air. (Why is it so cold? Isn't good news supposed to cradle??) The playground is too red yellow blue for this afternoon. Later on, this world will find him, and color him black and white.
04.27.04 "If I keep holding my breath I'm going to disappear..." -Thursday The knife through his chest means nothing to anyone, except for those who have breathed against it. The glare from the sun on the flat silver reflects in the eyes, blinding everyone who tries to care about someone else. And the blindness turns to madness (a knife through the core of the earth) until the whole world is crazy. The whole world is getting angry. Keep raging on and on until everything is dying. No one left breathing on anyone's chest.
Crime of Passion 04.27.04 I've expired. I've expired inside your lips. My rotting body I'm dragging somehow back into behind your eyes. You're resting your head on my lap. I'm resting on the ends of your nerves, like a bed of nails I'm sinking into... Pull me back up by my strings. I'll be your little marionette. Pull my back up by my strings before I bleed you all out.
Eager to Please Written o4.27.04 Chipping away at hardened lips to find the small and hidden fossil kiss. Layers of rock, layer of skin. I'm not that hard to sift through...
4.21.04 Just writing for the sake of writing. Right now I love everything periwinkle. Right now I'm feeling carsick, so carsick. Right now I'm laughing at burp and fart jokes. Right now the sunset makes me strawberry blonde. Right now I'm willing all the water in my body to break so I know what she'll feel like tonight. Right now I can hear her voice inside my head telling me all that stuff about the love of needles. Right now I am held down- We are held down by Murphy's Law. Right now I put down my pen.
04.29.04 I was bored out of my mind in Biology last period. Here goes: In Biology, supposed to be learning about gene mutations and my mind wanders to the sewers, green water and filth mutants rise. Like snakes with four eyes and rats that can fly and the twisting together of species somehow. And the slime and their blue blood and black guts and visible genes. I see my teacher there, four arms, deranged, distorted features, golden brown scales, serpents for hair. Breathing fire, like the words, rambling on, burn my bored-to-death ears and I still don't want to even pretend to care.
5.01.04 I wrote this one on the bus to North Hampton two days ago, and began to type it in Pride Zone, but got distracted. So here it is. Because safety pins trip me up like arrows aimed at my feet. Because fishnets trap me up like a mermaid under the ship. Because the bridge we are crossing as I write gives me a sudden sense of height. Because the crow suspended in midair- flapping its wings, beating the atmosphere- brings back the searing pain in my shoulderblades. Because there is a scratch on my arm and I don't know where it came from, I know I am unprotected. Because I have to save myself I have to stop writing this poem and just do it.
05.01.04 I wrote this in NoHo too...it was about a thousand degrees. That's all I have to say. With envy I sit in the wet grass. With envy of two strangers (as envy usually speaks) rolling on the ground, melting into each other- it's so fucking hot out here. We will all burn. But when the clouds roll overhead we will stiffen again and I wonder... (We're only wax!!) What shape will we take? I close my eyes and feel myself liquify...
This poem is kind of incomplete...I'm not happy with it. "I don't know who you are but I, I'm with you...I'm with you." -Avril Lavigne 5.8.04 To Be Friends Again For Danielle I'm sitting in thhe skating rink. I'm sitting in the past. Someones arm around me, doesn't matter who. Never mattered who. Your song to Rose or Amber or one of your girlfriends, I tried to dedicate it to you but you refused. You always refused. Your first kiss from a girl. IT WAS ME. But I'm not colorful enough for your hand in anything. Just Megan, not Crimson or Burgundy. It all just wasn't me. and all the things you said all the things you said. WHO'S RUNNING THROUGH YOUR HEAD NOW? I was never good enough fo you. Crystal could hold you, no questions asked. Clear as a diamond (not quite as sharp). and anyway, I can see through you both.
5.8.04 This one is really serious...I wrote it just for me strictly...but here it is...take it as you will. I envy things like Stephanie C.* and the way she stretches her little lip out, grinding her teeth, when she's worried (as am I) about dying. Just because of having the time of your life . It's her time, and it's her life, afraid to live it and live it right. If the cancer's there, the cancer's there. (We're only going to die.) She reminds the world, fearstricken. A little sex never did any harm until sex ed sets in. And the fear of the things you've done, because they're so very done - and they are why you fear you fear you are too.
The Worst of Me 5.7.04 Upon returning from the mall. Everyone is finding their reason. you are the reason I cant start a new notebooke. You are the reason I play all the music that my ears have retired after so very long... You are each note. I fill my head with a thousand reasons. I fill my head with you.
On Bryan II he's a needle he's only been a tool he's only been something to do he's only fulfilling your intentions of breing forever the world's pin cushion.
On Bryan I bottom lip rings, you ring in my ear and my head so loud never through piercing
5.8.04 Remember when you asked me if I was one hundred percent sure? Stimulate your fucking soul, wear out your young bodies how old we try to grow so fast. I watch you sleep I watch you aging... I look at me and what has become of choice of impulse of being in love (I love you.) Stimulate your fucking soul like this. Recycle everything you threw out when she left you to rot like compost; she dumped you. Now you shove all your waste into me. Little gnats all over my skin- your kisses...eating -away- at me. Catch a wisp of my hair between your teeth. Remember when you asked me if I was okay? Remember when you asked me
Sex Pistols Redefined (There is No Spoon) 5.9.04 I like the lack of capitals and punctuation here. Makes it flow really nice. its only are all weve created a little girl your bullet shooting up into my arm into my womb my heroine my daughter shes a sculpture only art our crack-cocaine snorted cause we laughed so hard at the thought its melting on a silver spoon burning bending these bodies curve were stainless steel (there is no spoon) ill kill myself under your gunpoint ram it through my head ill laugh at the thought of painting with blood and brains and amniotic fluid water broken all over the bed were rolling shes only art shes sid were nancy we watch her bleed and adore the scene watch her swirl down the drain and we curl up inside our little silver spoon and remember cracking melting
Bedroom Eyes II 6.4.04 When each little yellow capsule opens and swallows up a little red sip of her blood, he watches her sweet cells turn bitter, her sour lips turn blue. Her spectrum hands, soft black shirt slipping off golden shoulders. He watches as she walks though walls, as she turns water into wine. But he hates it when she acts like she's drunk. She's so sensitive, like gold. Yet so polished and silver and brass. Fragile as glass, he tries to hold her back. Three different color knots and still she floats away. A pink balloon, a neon kite. (The sky is biting her) and his white white tongue is SCREAMING out her name but the letters are absorbed into the little yellow capsules and though he knows all of her weak spots he too easily abuses all of his strength.
Mistress, you've done nothing wrong, unless you consider breathing a sin. Though the air you inhale is filthy and dry, You can blow it back out again. And anyway last night I sat, huddled in the corner of my room, smoking one of Matt's cigarettes and writing a poem for you. It was about feelings and the way I want to fall. It was about passion and the turquoise of your walls. It was about the joint that I'd wish you'd pass to me for once. It was about breaking through the locks that have held me for months. But I don't want to go back, I just want you to step up with me. I don't want that shit to bind you. I just wish I could set you free.....
Mistress, this is for you and no one else. The only thing in disguise has been my fear. Maybe I haven't tried hard enough to save you. Maybe I've been so deaf to hear. Or maybe you just don't scream for me anymore. Maybe you don't ask for my assistance. I think that the drugs are just locks and chains and you've grown too weak to resist it. But I don't know what it is exactly, so I don't know what to say. If you still think I'm perfect, I still think you're wrong, but I'll stay here anyway.
bloodstained16: monday, you are being forced to endure at least one real hug from me, for i need to prove that your still there. Alright, know what, I'm not done rambling for the night if I don't have to be...I made a decision when I started this journal that it would be for ME to write it...somewhere to spilllll my guts all over the place and not have to clean them up. People read imy words, and that makes me happy. It does. Matt isn't the only one who cares...I know this now. Bloodybiter487: there is no way in hell i could ever live without you here Bloodybiter487: i duno wat i wouldve done if i had lost you Bloodybiter487: a part of me would be gone SicTransitHero: ...really? Bloodybiter487: yes really Bloodybiter487: you amaze me every time i see you and i mean it's not even becuz of any of your outside butbecuz i kno how you feel soemtimes and becuz you accept me adnd i can just be me around you without even worrying. i could be the ugliest person in the world and you'd still care about me Bloodybiter487: and your so just wow Bloodybiter487: you take up a good portion of my heart Bloodybiter487: it kills me to see you in pain I got off the phone with Mike because there were NO words being exchanged, and he wanted his pizza, and then he put on BD...and...I teared up. The BD thing is like a disease, I spread it, like the caffiene pills thing. But now everyone is addicted and chronically shaking and I want to take it all out of their systems but I can't...it's a part of them now. Not the same way as it is to me, but I caan't be selfish. I can choose to fight the pangs, but I can't demoolish them. I'm still trying to decide how I feel about Indie...whether there was Fitz or not, I couldn't act on my feelings for Sam, I'd hurt Indie. I think that's maybe what sizzled my feelings for her, that she's always so sad about things, I never got to see her happy. But Sam is always happy, except when she's upset about Mike, and she talks a lot about how no one wants her and that she wants to die and all of those things, but it's not like she's the next NickBrown. She can still smile. And her voice...awe, ir's so happy and full of energy. Oh, here I go telling Sam I like her...when she kissed me in NoHo...I was so completely blown away, like, I thought I would never get that chance and I did and it was all on her part and...wow....what a feeling. Matt and I are talking about loss and gain and death and rebirth. I am trying to get Perfectly Die out of my head now...:(....I am lonely, now I want to wade in this somewhat geeky-kind-of-cute patheticness and listen to the Postal Service. Today I added another song to the list of the most all-time bestest most heartwrenching tear-jerking songs ever to me. MxPx's "Special Girlfriend"...for the first line. "When I meet a special girl, she always lives somewhere else in the world..." It's true, Justin, Brad, Jared, Will (?), Brett, Hacky, Christoph, Ant, and...well...Nick Brown I guess. I know not a single one there is female, but distance changes everything and I absolutely hate it. But I heard this quote on the radio the other night in some song, Mom said it was the Eagles but then she said nope, it wasn't and she couldn't think of who it was. But anyway, I haven't forgotten a word of it: "You can spend all your time making love, or you can spend all your love making time..." -apparently unknown It's too true...like Sic Transit Gloria...Glory Fades : "You don't recover from a night like this, a victim still lying in bed completely motionless.......(this is so m e s s e d up.) ......" That song was on the list the night I first listened to the lyrics. JC, they were like a blow to the stomach...I don't know. Whatever. Everyone have fun stealing that song from me too!! While you're at it take "Konstantine" and "What a Good Boy" and "Off the Hook" and "Konstantine" and "Crazy" and "Konstantine" and "Special Girlfriend" and "Push" and oh yeah, "Konstantine." I am naming one of my little girls that. Maybe Beau, like a middle name. But Beau Konstantine is whack. We'd call her Tinie. Beau should be short for like Beauregard, right? But what about BEAUtiful? Because she is.So her full name can be Beautiful Konstantine. Beau. and then Chrysdolyn Felicity or Chrysdolyn Konstantine or Chrysdolyn Drus/cilla...and then Jacob, we decided on, but if any others in the future, (FAR FAR FUTURE) they are Deff. going to be Remington Pierce and possible Hike-Richael Allen, as originally planned. Those and Chrys. Felicity and Kidrey Danielle. Now that Dani Webster is a part of my life, maybe...her. I have a L O T of time to worry bout this. you have a way to capture me the things you say bring meaning to what I dont know I look at u and wonder what millions of things run thru u r u in love? did u stop beleving in love? U take the world in your pocket and me in ur heart wen i see you I understand y sum ppl smile for no reason -Maureen (N.H.) Madre approaching. I better wrap this up ( YOU JUST HATE ME CUZ I'M BLACK. ) I need to medicate and then piss and then drink lots of caffinated cola to keep me up until 2 when Josh supposedly gets home and then explain to him all the events of the past hours. Then attempt to read, make another water-glue collage (explain this one later i will because it is exciting and these i cannot scan and sound like dr. suess i do.) and then pass out, all the while scolding myself for not being able to stay up. But I lived through some kind of tragedy I guess...so...I think maybe I deserve a little sleep tonight. I'll see Josh tm if they swing by and drop me off while house-hunting...(o ya my mom is moving, she told me b4 i left on my little morning escapade...i was bummed, but now i think maybe it will be good to leave this area...after what happened and Steve being there and Braeburn St. and such. Dad, too. I need a lot of serious change.) Thank God. Thank you, Matt, Sam, Indie, Maureen, Greg, Patt...everyone who has been there for me through this and in the past. Thank you sooo much. I feel like I'm on an award show ("If I only had a brain..." -sb) so go 'head, change the channel. This show is way way over. I'm done. Turn me over.
I just got home from Egypt's party, thank God I got an escape from my mind for a while. Julie was there, and this girl Stephanie who is really cute and yeah...we watched Scary Movie 3 and the George guy made me think WAY too much of Mike, and I missed him, and yeah....and a lot of the lines made me think of Patt because he was quoting them one day and he drew The Ring in my sketchbook at lunch and stuff and I still see it a lot so yeah...but anyway, we laughed a lot and invented the word PHILOSOPHIZE and ASSUMPTIONATION or something like that, I forget. But yeah, people in that movie got hit by cars a lot and every time I cringed all up inside...didn't know what to think...still don't. Yeah, I'll be fine...it just seems like of all the people I've told so far, Matt is the only one who has really truly cared, besides Steve the Mute, but I'm not sure if he cares really or is still trying to get in my pants. I can't stop thinking about everything, but I can't help it. I know I'm not the only one who wants to stop thinking altogether sometimes....right? I'm just so...I don't know. To many things for my own good, I guess. Mike says he will always be there for me...WHY ISN'T HE THERE FOR ME NOW!? I mean, I DO need him...he says I need Fitzy because I'm his girlfriend, but he's not here, he has no idea what even happened...and I just need someone to care for once. I didn't think that was asking too much, but now that I know it is, I'll shut up. All I ever seem to do when something happens, when I am upset, truly, or something like that, is ANNOY people, bother them. When I'm 100% spiffy, everyone wants to be there for me...is there something wrong with me? Honestly? Right now I'm trying to decide why I am typing all this into an online journal because it just makes me look like I'm begging for sympathy and I'm not, so this is dumb. I'm keeping everything bottled up from now on if I can, but I'm such a heart-on-my-sleeve kind of girl that I can't help it. I need someone. My Fitz? ...I really would honestly have preferred Mike to comfort me tonight, even if Fitzy was around...Mike can make me feel soooo much better about myself than anyone ever has been able to, I wish he could see that, I really do....It still hurts me all the time to see him, and then the other night when he asked what would I do if next time he saw me he just randomly kissed me, I really really wanted to say I would kiss him back...HARD. But I couldn't. It wouldn't have been right even if I didn't have a boyfriend. I miss being single, but when I am, I miss having people there for me without trying to get with me. I wish no one wanted to get with me and everyone was just a close friend. I'm going to call Mike now...I don't think anyone wants to continue to scroll down and read me ramble on and on about my stupid teen angst or whatever because there are more important things, like life itself. I learned that this morning, and know what...? ....I don't think it was really to my cost. I learned from it. If not to look both ways before crossing the street, but to keep my fear to myself...everyone has there one issues, and know what? I will be fine....(sigh.) Goodnight, sweet dreams.
This is not an average entry, and it's so hard to type, so excuse any and all typos. I know my journal is so happy-go-lucky, so gleefull, random spillings of all that's swimming around like swan boats in the tunnels of love. But this is different. This is very different. Take this seriously...very very very seriously. There is no light at the end of the tunnel to go running to...it flickers out so fast, it's all gone so very very fast. Last night I was walking with Fitz to.....the new local dwelling........and I mentioned that I didn't believe in death...I am very solipsistic, so no, I didn't...I don't think. I mean, really think about it, when someone else dies, you experience grief and whatnot, you almost die inside, but to die yourself? To never smell, see, hear, feel anything ever again...and to be so unaware, yet not even so much as that. NOTHING. I couldn't lose it....God, I couldn't lose it..I can't even think about it without tearing up. But once it's gone, it's gone. A taste of death is nothing unless it is a taste of your own...I mean it. There were crowds of people asking me if i was okay, tons of them, strangers, caring for me? (!!!) I mean, I just...left the scene...it wasn't mine. I didn't want it to be mine. they could all have it, go home and said to their families and friends............you'll never believe what I saw so up close this morning...then again.....yeah, it's all too believable. But for me, I really don't think it happened, it seems so very unreal. it was just so.....fast. Did they just feel bad?? They all stopped and got out of their cars, maybe 10 or 15 cars backed up on a side street, because of me, lying on the ground, bent, like in the Hoobastank video, I guess...but a lot more real. Then again, not...it.....oh God. oh God. This can never happen to me. This will never happen to me. Did it?? In a way, I feel deprived. It wasn't much, no battle scars, not even a bruise where the pavement kissed me, no blood where the painted lines bit me. No proof that it even happened at all, just...flashbacks, and not even clear ones. bloodstained16: of course they were caring for you.....just think about it megan. how many of us would give our life to protect you? im sure i can believe, but anyone who hasnt been in the situation can only understand up to a point. i...i dont know...it just reminds of all of our mortality i guess. just that no matter what happens, where we all end up or anything, i love you and you know you can rely on me. I said last night that I believed in self-immortality, immortality of the mind, the soul I guess. Maybe even these temples that our bodies supposedly are. (Not a scratch, not a scratch) but...just...wow. We're...I don't even know what we are (or aren't). I haven't exactly explained the situation... Benjamin St...right lane, if you could call it a lane. The far one. Champagne colored car...old, cheerful kind of man...his wife, staying away...young man...20-30ish, his little ones, just...me, on the ground. I think. I don't know where I was, what happened exactly. I heard so very very very very loudly, as id there was no other sound but this, the thud of life against the hood, mirror, door of a plasticy, materialistic...........car. I felt like I was under the tire, if I wasn't so physically fine (I still don't know how this happened) then I would SWEAR I slipped beneath it. Maybe I did see the light, but it was gone so fast...I don't know what I was thinking. I really don't. All my thoughts were smudged out by the thud. . . . . "Driving home to be with you the highway's divided, the city's in veiw. As usual, I'm almost on time. You're the last thing that's on my mind. Wish I could tell you the way that I feel, but tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel. no commotion, no screaming brakes. most of it's over before i awake... from the ceiling my coffee cup drips, while out my window the horizon does flips. THE WORSE PART WAS HITTING THE GROUND NOT THE FEELING SO MUCH AS THE SOUND. can't help but wonder if all this is real, cuz tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel. Rubberneck traffic and passersby. Slow-motion waltzer, the fir engine guy. Stand around with their mouths open wide... heard some idiot ask if someone's inside. With the jaws of life they tried and they tried... nobody here can know how I feel cuz tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel. (I guess it's over now, cuz I've never seen so much, never seen so much, never seen so much... I guess it's over now, cuz I've never seen so much, never seen so much, never seen so much... b l o o d...) In all the confusion there's something serene. I'm just a posthumous part of the scene. Now I'm floating above looking in as the radio blares and wheels spin. I can see my face slump with a grin and you. . . you're the last thing on my mind. you're the last thing on my mind. you're the last thing on my mind. you're the last thing on my mind." -Barenaked Ladies
Really really really sleepy, I am trying my best to focus my eyes on the little white letters on the black keys but it's not working to dandy...blech. Dammit. Now my eye muscles hurt. Okay, so you take it I just woke up, and yes, you are a mighty fine guesser. I just go tup to a call from Greg about Rocky and I wanna go soooo bad but it's so incovenient the nights that it is :( I'm bummed. Then my call gets cut off by the madre calling about whether I was going skating or to the mall, and I'm like Neither, Ma, hullo. Don't ya know nuthin?? Nahh, I was like Yo, the new joint...ya kno...the secret secksy one...yeppers. But now I deff have to get a hold of Fitzy and I don't know where he is...:-/ he didn't call me this morning before school, which is fine, but like, where is he now?? I just miss him and I haven't exactly seen him since last Wednesday so that's not too keeewwwwllll......bleh. I am still really tired. WOAH...it so sounds like something just fell on the roof.....SANTA!!!???!?!?!?!? OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG *presents fer meeeeeee!* Yeppers. Hold on, I will now depart to retrieve the gifts destined only to be in the possesion de moi...i mean, brb. *frown* *frown* *frown* *upsidedown smile* *frown*...osiewell. gtg. love.
Library. Bundles of fun, I know. F, just now I got to go on the orange swings and it was sexy and yep. But Marky-Mark-Creepy-Jimmy-Jim-James-I-want-your-last-name-Sexton was thurr and yep, he's an odd one. Unnyways, Katie is hurr with me and she it typin too....yippe....I am bored and all sweaty from Gymeven tho we only SWUNG. Right now I am going through a crisis of whether or not SWINGED is a word. And then I decided I don't really care!! This morning Vinny was dropping off Tasia as usual and I wansn't in the caf I was outside with Matt and Nicki and Tougie and I ran over to say Hi to Vin and Arcadio comes over like Let's go, Let's go..and pulling me away I'm like JC Arcadio WTF!? So I follow Matt and Nicki and Tougie across to the arena for some s t r a n g e reason and DJ and ...sarah... were there I guess as usual but I wouldn't know and oh yeah, WOULDN'T CARE FOR MY LIFE!! Anywhoo...I saw Maureen smizzoking and I was like bllaaaahh hun u can't keep on doin that :( and she was talking to um...this girl who did her hair like me though she did it before me thats the only way I know her. Yep. But they were talking about stuff and Maureen said she got to make out with Brenda and she was all excited about it and then I was like bllllaaaaah summore so when Brenda came trotting over I left and joined the rest a the gang...Matt, Nicki, Tougie, Deej, and ........sarah. They were talking about Pyro-day which apparently today is so I just sat and attempted to, yet again, sketch Matt. I'm telling you, that's what the fucking movie Mission: Impossible should have been about because know what, it is! And Nicki and I talked a bit, actually she kept cracking up for NO reason so I was laughing at her a lot too and there was just tons and tons o' laughin' goin' down. The end! Speakin of going down...I miss my Fitz so much, I really do. Katie is here and I am thinking about how some ppls call her Fitzy too because her middle name is Fitzgerald and anyway I don't see why she doesn't like her name, it's so pretty-Kathryn Fitzgerald Foley-so I think she will be Kathy from now on...(*Katie I betcha you're reading this with a GRR face on...mwah, i love ya!! haha) Okies, I am sooooo fucking female these days, so today I a little bit better pulled a Dani Webster but I wanna shave my head and go GQin at Eblens (Dad: "Do you suppose Eb and Len are gay?") and then I can be her...Speaking of... I was thinking about it, and I am a bit like Dani, I really really really really really am, though I bet ya all think I'm crazy for saying that (those of you who read The Game ) but I am!! Not like you all probably see me, but I am!! And on Cut ,I am not not not Callie. I am not! I am like...the Amanda/Manda. I am. Yep. Callie's got the amazing insight thing like I do, but she could pull off not talking to anyone...it is 12:24, but I think they're gonna hold the bell for a while. Okay, so I'm deff deff not Scratch...she's like the Angelina Jolie in Girl, Interrupted ...Okay, let's talk about something important...last night I was on the phone with Fitzy, but I wasn't exactly. I'm getting a lot better at Astral Projection, and I love it, it is my escape, my cure. I can run away inside my head and run my hands through the waves of his hair and feel him crash all over me...I wrote that last night, you like? I'm thinking of writing a book a la Francesca Lia Block ...or a Koertge like Brimstone Journals thing going on, all in poetry. That would be such a challenge for a writer like me though because I am like obssesed with details. I am thinking about what it would be like to be blind...to never be able to see colors or angles...or to be deaf, never get to hear your sweet whisper in your ear and all that romantic crap. That makes me think of Donkey which makes me think of Noble Steeds and Stallions which makes me think of the Faun I drew in MCAS and he's pretty gorgeous, but that makes me think of Arcadio trying to tell me he takes the form of a taur and he's like asking me the diff between a taur and a tyr and I'm like okay, so how you gonna tell me what I drew if you don't know? This makes me mad. I chain think. You know how some people like chainsmoke, well I chain think, REAL BAD. (adhd its not my fault I swear) but yeah urm that makes me think of this poem I wrote once about Batteries Included Jeff, aka Jeff Chewy...about that time he came and talked to me about ADHD and that I should start smoking pot because it will mellow me out and I was trying to picutre him as a young'n and it was soo cute cuz he's a cutie as it is, bein 20 and all. I am going to write a Love/Hate poem about Fitz, like I did with Mike, but I don't know if I have much to draw from because it's seeming like our whole relationship is one big dream, a cloud of pixiedust that I'm trying to peer through, it's all energy. Whoopsie, bell. More later. Love.
I am on the phone with Fitzy. Mike just called me Hott Stuff and I bit my lip and it hurts :(. I was singing "Annihilation of the Generations" and it was hot. I drew a really good sketch just freehand off the top of my head of this girl and I am calling her Velle. She was pale and gorgeous and then I got shit on the picture and so I had to darken her hair and I freaked...ask Matt, I was on the phone with him at the time. I only have a second to type though as usual...it's 9:28 and I have a 9:30 curfew...I will say some significant things. In GSA, I almost cried. Ms. Horowitz is leaving!!! Oh my god!! Her mother is sick, and she's moving to NY and Northup is taking over but that's beside the point. It's really sad. She's the Rena. (RGH, look what you guys got me saying!) But yeah, Fitzy will "brb" and I can here Bryan in the background and he sounds like a dying brontasaurus and now come to think of it he looks like one too! I really really really don't like him. Icky icky. Anywhoo...I really love Fitz (*joshie*)...I really do. He makes me smile, he's the only one who, upon asking me to do something that will cheer me up, I actually do it instead of pretending to. I talked to Schizo Meg on the way home today for like literally an HOUR but I guess it was actually really cool. I have to go medicate now. Is anyone actually reading this? One time I was listening to 89.9 and this kid's on there like "is anyone actually listening to this? I'm on the radio talking to the airwaves and no one is listening...." it was weird because I was listening....I was like REBELLIOUSNESS YEAH! Okie so in GSA Jeff and Kyle-Kate like gave GOODBYE SPEECHES...it was really realyl really sad. I mean, really. And I, personally, had a convo with Jeff because he saw me sketching Maureen and was saying how I was really really good and it got into like should a person have to really choose between being an artist or a writer, or like having one be their specialty over the other. It was pointless, but one of those conversations that are just nice to have, ya know? Like the Schizo Meg convo...it was kinda nice to spill my guts..."...as I rip my self wide open on this stage while I am paid to spill my guts...o I would kill for the Atlantic, but I am paid to make girls PANIC while I sing..." -bn...I think I should wrap this up because Fitz wants to talk and I want to hear his SECKSY voice...and then I'm going to shower and medicate and read this dumb Echo book with this secksy guy who is an angel. It's neat-o. And her mother dearest lies on the kitchen table naked with crystals all over her taking in all the light and the rainbows and I want to be her so I told Matt that I am her from now on the end. Okies, I'm leaving...Don't miss me ...(EXCUSE ME.)-Dobbs.
In the library, I don't really even want to finish my earlier entry really. I don't have much else to say though...ehh, the MCAS math part SUCKED but I got to miss 1/2 of E so it was all good. Nicki came and caught me on my way in late this morning to get the book from me to give to Matt because he was going to Ethan's or something and then coming back for all 3 lunches....come to think of it I should probably go find him now, but whatever. Anyway, yeah. So GSA is in 30 minutes when I'm done writing, though I'm not sure I even really want to go. If I remember correctly (because yes, I am medicated today) Matt won't be there....don't know about Nicki, but that's of less importance...doesn't sway my choice. But yeah, I guess I'll go to see Maureen and Tiff...Mostly Maureen...I liked GSA last week...it was....nice. I'm not looking forward to hearing *coughHER-DICTATORSHIPcough* (and by that I mean Dictatorshi T .)but I'll sketch a bit. I was supposed to sketch Kelly too, but I haven't been able to. In honesty, at first I really didn't even want to, but you know what? I think, I might as well...as long as she understands that it will be like the first picture I've ever like given away EVER so I'll need so much as to scan it first. And then Amanda Peliteer asked me to draw her somehting before she leaves to hang in her new place in FLA when she graduates. That's 2 by next Friday! Ehh, THEN I have to do the Cookie/Jackie sketch I want to do for them for a grad. gift because when ya get right down to it, Cook's my brother. He may be a complete idiot and he may have hit me for no reason every two seconds when I was little, but I got used to it and I love him...plus Jackie GQed him all up! She's wicked good in my book. Anywhoooo...My hallucinations are getting worse. It's not good. I mean, I used to be used to them, and then I got used to the meds as like a rat poison for them or something. They were totally gone and I guess that was fine. But now they are back, and they stick...they don't just come and go. The up-side is, D-N is back around. I think that's a good thing...I don't know what he's there for, but when he is there, it gets me thinking about stuff, it's like....excersize for my third eye or whatever you want to call it. I don't know. I'm rambling, I'm sorry. Friday night I have no idea what's going to go down. (Heh, heh) but actually, yes I do. I really really do. I'm not going to the mall. All of you who are reading this and expect me, get it now. I will not be there for any reason whatsoever. And (I'm gonna get hit for this one I bet...) I'm not going skating. *FLINCH* Sorry, guys...no, I'm not though. I'm going to the new local dwelling with hopefully *Joshie* and maybe Matt will meet us there, if people don't pull the whole guilt thing on him or whatever...Mike does that, and I thought I gave in too easily. Ehh, Matt is so much there for everyone that I don't think he ever really knows what he truly truly wants, and if he does, there is someone else pulling him from it, making him think that he wants something else. Poor Matt, I guess...ehh, I love him anyway, he's my best friend in the whole wide world and I hope we can get together Friday because we don't chill enough. But if he has something else to do then that's what he's gonna do and I respect that. Matt needs freedom. He really really does. I hope Sam will tag along, too. I think it will be a P E R F E C T environment for her. For the 4 of us. Mr. DiVenuto is the man. He's all "whhoooo there's a typist right there....you know, at that rate, you can make a LOT of $$ in college. In my day, I could do like 75 wrds/min and we had typerwriters, not computers....phhhew I made a looot of $$." Yep. He's the man. Anywho, erm, where was...oh yes...Sam. Yeah, it would be a really great time, I know it. I've really reasoned out who should really madly deeply be there without bringing half the mall, because I mean, the point of it all if breakaway, I guess. Change, maybe? I don't know...maybe like just an escape? Something better? Closer contact within reason? I mean, it's a bunch of stuff I guess, but the point is that I just want OUT of the mall. Us 4 would be the best, if it works. Few things I plan work...so I don't have high hopes at all.... I have like, a ton on my mind right now, so I guess I'm just rambling on and hoping a lot of it spills. Like this: Last night Dad asked h y p o t h e t i c a l l y if we were to move to somewhere where I'd have to change schools would that totally and completely bother me and I didn't have to answer...my eyes did. And that's a good sign. I know I have my "looks" and people who know me well know by now what a lot of those looks are and what they mean. I have lost my ability to fully communicate with my eyes, I think. Or maybe no one just understands and can read them anymore. I don't know. Why am I hitting the keys so hard all of a sudden ? Dad was also talking about cutting of all the cell phones except like Amy's or whatever for assorted reasons. It wouldn't be a total loss, I never exactly talk to anyone anymore or use the AIM on it or even the camera, so what would it matter? Yeah there would be less freedom I guess..but I can live with that. It is 12:25 and the bell rang as I was typing the time, so this is goodbye.
"when you see me on the street don't believe my face, you can bet i'm a muthafuckin basketcase..." -BedDestroyers Depression Morning all...oh, god, don't make me get into the BD thing. Not now. Anyways...I don't even really feel like writing, I only created this journal so I could have something worthwhile to do in the library at school now seeing as I have given up hope on getting any work done on urlLink my site and I haven't been as good about my poetry lately as I have been...so yeah, here is my solution. Time isn't the coolest thing in the world. It's really not. I mean, look at yesterday...SUCKED. (The entry is it's own little page at the moment, don't feel like copying and pasting it.) Okay yeah, but here's the deal...TIME. I hate it. I really do. I've always pretended to like, love it, but I really don't. I'm still recovering from yesterday, I can't stand another bad day if they expect to keep lowering the medication. I mean, seriously, though. Because I called Matt back last night as soon as I was off the phone with *joshie* to certify thay he'd be at the flagpole in the AM so I can give him that book so he can read it and get it back to me on Friday because yesterday wasn't successful on that subject. But NO. Amy has to wake me up with a "you- do -know-it's-7, right?" and I FLIP. Of course, my throat feels like someone hacked through it with a hacksaw (that is what one does with a hacksaw, right? I'll post-it that one...) Okay, I only have like 2.5 seconds to type because I have been sitting here waiting for MOM to get me and bring me to school late. NOT COOL. I don't see why Cookie can't get off his puny white ass and drive me, HE HAS TO GO ANYWAY, but whatever. *Joshie* called me this morning to wake me and I couldn't talk :( so yeah, sorry about that, Dad just called me in to talk about my Meds...about have u missed any doses? you don't wanna miss doses... okay GREAT THANKS! Gtg, mother's arrival. More at noon.
Before I explain last night, here is my day...the important stuff anyway. I HATE DRAMA. I like Sam. A lot. So much, that I was actually considering thinking about leaving Fitzy for her. That's pathetic, I know. And that patheticness has only been proven farther. This morning I asked her if she would ever consider being with me. She said maybe, she'd have to think on it...but probably. She tells this to Mike. She tells everything to Mike...her best friend. And so come the threats. He IMs me: "You're on my shyt list" and later "Stay the fuck away from Sam." They're together now. Congrats to them. Don't know what happened to Mike. Guess I've always known he's like this. But yeah...I don't care who reads this. I will tell the fucking world...because "keeping quiet is hard, cuz you cant keep a secret if it never was a secret at all." She can tell Mike things I don't want him to know, I will tell the world what she probably won't be happy about me showing. I'm not doing this to be a bitch or to hurt her... I'm doing this so I don't have to relive this heartbreak. TeArStAiNdSoUl6: whats wrong? TeArStAiNdSoUl6: you did the face thingy TeArStAiNdSoUl6: ??hello?? TeArStAiNdSoUl6: i take it you dont want to talk to me TeArStAiNdSoUl6: awright then cya SicTransitHero: hey SicTransitHero: hi SicTransitHero: sorry Auto response from TeArStAiNdSoUl6: TeArStAiNdSoUl6: In my room,call me if you want 781-6238..alone....

SicTransitHero: it was all hypothetical anyway, and why is he mad at me because of that??? its not like hes with u TeArStAiNdSoUl6: if you want me to leave you alone, then stop talking....its only making this harder then it already is TeArStAiNdSoUl6: for me anyways SicTransitHero: ya and u telling mike made everything harder for me TeArStAiNdSoUl6: welcome to my world megan SicTransitHero: you dont realize what you've come to mean to me, and dont argue that because if you did you'd not ave told him SicTransitHero: *have TeArStAiNdSoUl6: just stop talking, iv made shit alot worse, so why the fuck are you still bothering me? just go on and make things better for urself, leave me like everyone else, goodbye SicTransitHero: IM BOTHERING YOU?

TeArStAiNdSoUl6: do as you wish, its not my decision SicTransitHero: yes it is TeArStAiNdSoUl6: your the one that told me to go away SicTransitHero: it was your decision to tell him, you were mature enough to mkae that one. TeArStAiNdSoUl6: i tell my best friend everything SicTransitHero: i told you to leave me alone, not to go away, im upset SicTransitHero: but if he is your best friend i honestly dont understand why he has the right to keep you from being happy SicTransitHero: that's not a friend SicTransitHero: a friend wouldn't threaten people because they care about you too SicTransitHero: a friend should let you live your life SicTransitHero: a friend should understand that you have your own feelings SicTransitHero: a friend shouldnt control you SicTransitHero: or the people you like TeArStAiNdSoUl6: hes more then a friend megan SicTransitHero: sic transit gloria mundi TeArStAiNdSoUl6: what? SicTransitHero: i know, sam...i know. SicTransitHero: i thought i could be too TeArStAiNdSoUl6: you go out with fitzy, he asked before you broke up with fitz SicTransitHero: sic transit gloria mundi, it means "so passes away the glory of the world" TeArStAiNdSoUl6: if you werent going out with fitz still, i woulda gone out with you TeArStAiNdSoUl6: but its a little late now SicTransitHero: i wasn't asking you out, i was asking you if you would ever consider...even if i wasnt with him i wasnt asking you out...and what a great boyfriend to threaten other people you care about...seriously sam. you know mike, youre not going to be with him forever anyway... SicTransitHero: so im not gonna give up on you, whatever it takes SicTransitHero: and im not going to break up with fitz anytime soon because this has put things into perspective for me TeArStAiNdSoUl6: good SicTransitHero: someone who cares about you should respect you and your feelings and give you space and let you live... TeArStAiNdSoUl6: i dont want space right now love, i really dont need space, i need someone to always be like he is TeArStAiNdSoUl6: i need to be controlled TeArStAiNdSoUl6: otherwise im not a loyal mate TeArStAiNdSoUl6: nor a loyal friend SicTransitHero: so let him control YOU. not me. TeArStAiNdSoUl6: dont let him control you SicTransitHero: he shoudlnt be trying! TeArStAiNdSoUl6: he cant ifyou dont let him TeArStAiNdSoUl6: i dont know hun, i just dont know SicTransitHero: i dont want to be threatened by him, i dont want him to push me away because of my feelings when you share them with me TeArStAiNdSoUl6: do you want me to tell him that? SicTransitHero: he should be more open and not stupid and realize that if hes with u nothing will happen between me and you anyway, and just let it go SicTransitHero: why bother asking??? YOU TELL HIM EVERYTHING, REMEMBER!?!?! TeArStAiNdSoUl6: omfg, megan...im just gonna go away SicTransitHero: I'm so confused because first it was me with my arm around someone and my eyes around another and it was Sam who sat with me on the cold ground while I wrote and wrote all the things I was thinking about the Ferris wheel and the shadows and the way her lips fit nicely in her face. But I am lost in my own head, for I barely bothered to look up and watch her go by, spinning, spinning, like she does in my head. Sam was sitting right by me. Right there! I could reach out and touch her (I still don't know why I didn't.) And anyway she just wanted to be kissed. For someone to heal the scratches on her back. And though I am usually the one causing the marks I'd have kissed them better if it wasn't for the Ferris wheel. TeArStAiNdSoUl6: f i see you around....i see you around....do as you wish from here on out without me because i dont know what you want from me right now, im wicked confused....goodbye SicTransitHero: by leaving you're only giving up. you are choosing to stay confused rather that understanding and fixing everything. i don't want anything from you now...not anymore..i just don't want to be threatened for liking you whether i act on it or not...i dont want to be made guilty for feeling. ever. you shouldn't either, sam. i don't know what else i can do, i only know that i don't like seeing you confused or hurt or anything because of what he does to you. when he leaves you and such, you are devastated...i know it, everyone knows it. he hurts you again and again and what makes it hurt so bad is that you can't stop loving him well know what? this is what you are doing to me by telling him things that aren't his business, by letting him control you so much that he's trying to control me. you know how bad it hurts. it's gotta hurt a lot worse to inflict that pain on others. Auto response from TeArStAiNdSoUl6: TeArStAiNdSoUl6: ......just kill me....... TeArStAiNdSoUl6: ....it does.... This is my entire entry for tonight. For a while. My reckless abandonment had led me back to paper... and I like it that way. My feelings are mine. Threaten me, but now your hatred has no backbone. You asked for it. Sic Transit Gloria Mundi.
LAST NIGHT WAS AWESOME!!! I don't really have much time to explain. I will write later, I just wanted to let all of you peoples know that I haven't forgotten about you. I will be back. Don't worry. Love n sex n PLUR over n out (TALLY HO) hahaha
Library. Last night I didn't write because I was really really upset. I went to Dr. T yesterday and he's like talkin about going up and up and up with my meds. This morning I took a double dose and I'm feelin pretty damn fine if I do say so muhself. I'm sh-sh-shaking a whole lot. Last night I got some bed news. THE LITTLE OLD LADY MOVED OUT OF HER SHOE AND MY MOM IS MOVING IN! That's right. I am moving to Chicopee. That is so bad. Bad bad bad bad bad. I cried for hours last night. Everything today is reminding me of lines in Thursday songs, I don't know why. This morning I walked to the bus, got on the bus, made fun of the rap with Tougie...Got to school, let Nicci* like hang all over me, went into the small caf cuz the big caf was taken fer senior brunch, then as I was walking over to the table I passed Jake and he pulled me like over and on his lap and like flipped me all over the place and I thought I was going to die but it was nice. It was fun. Then I ran around trying to find B block's class cuz we weren't in the auditiorium and so I found em in 225 and we watched KATIE DO "LITTLE GIRLS" and it's sooooooo funny. It's hot tho, I must admit. Thank GOD I don't think Katie ever reads this journal because I really like her so much. Matt said something the other night about "if anyone can turn katie bi its u megan"...I WISH IT WAS THE EASY!! I REALLY DO because yep, she's amazing! Urm...anyway...let's not talk about my little plans..he he okay sOoOoOo ya B was fun. Then we went to C, and it was alright, like usual, and Jake like wouldn't let go of my hand the whole period because he didn't want me to leave, as in leave Central or SPFLD or both. Anyway he put on my sweatpants and wore them thru C and while he walked me to D, it was cute. BUT WHAT IS WITH GUYS ALWAYS PUTTING ON MY SWEATPANTS!?!?!?! Seriously? Then in D Patt was there and he is hott and yep. Okay so we watched the class day thing on the telly and me and .........sarah............ sat and talked about the meanings of life and i had to try and convince her that i don't have BORDERLINE because she has it and is convinvced like everyone else does. So then I was just like ok whatever I don't really like you. And went back to my story which I wicked figured out. E, we got in a fight with Ms Lee because she gave the whole class detention because the creepy purple hands hunchback sub lady we had yesterday told her that someone in our class stole the attendence lists. People are dumb. Then I came here and Egypt is here and Arcadio just showed up and zippety-do-dah we are getting KRRRRRRUNKED. That is a word Egypt found in some random persons journal that just popped up and she doesn't knwo what it means, so it is out word. Okay, I am going to go do something else on here because I cannot concentrate. Ps. The Senior Prank is great this year!! I'll tell you about it later.
I forgot my medicine this morning. It wasn't intentional. I did. But things like last period (F) are perfect examples of why I made this whole reckless abandonment decision. I was in gym, and alright, I was okay, so yeah, I'd actually play volleyball instead of avoiding the ball for the hell of it. Yesterday somehow it ended up being literally 20+ people on each side of the net. It was just like, who could slam the ball harder across the gym, then run for it and do it again. It wasn't volleyball. It most deff wasn't. I didn't give a shit yesterday. I just stood quiet and stepped to the side when the ball came flying viciously at my FACE. But today, okay it was like Marky-Mark-Jimmy-Jim-James-I-want-your-last-name-Sexton, Steph B. Steph C. that black girl and I. It was fun. Then people kept jumping in the middle of the game, but it was okay because I was actually playing, which I love to and usually do, but they all assumed that I was always what I was like yesterday. SoOoOoOoOoOo...then A M A N D A-im-a-barbie-girl-W E S C O T T jumps in and okay, let me first say hat I don't know what her problem with me has been from the beginning, but she has not liked me and given me all kinda of real subtle shit in the past. Yesterday real bad. But today thet fat-fuck-freshman who whips the ball at everyones faces not knowing his own strength (in ANY GAME HE PLAYS) im not kiddin either, jumps in and like whips it at me so i duck rite...it woulda been outta bounds. N everyone who just showed up n didnt see me hitting the ball more than anyone else before is like IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HIT THE FUCKING HIT THE BALL SIT DOWN! YOU DONT WANT TO FUCKING PLAY, SIT THE FUCK DOWN and I'm just like omg it was clearly out. n basically the same thing happens again tho it wasnt even a 3 feet within the spot where I was standing, but literally everyone like stops and turns and just looks at me, it was like a cartoon. So I flip. I mean, jesus christ, I flipped. So I just leave and go sit in the weight room with all the 300lb black girls and their Usher. Then they put on "Burn" and tears are pouring down my face, but they're too tough to talk to the crying little white girl (THANK GOD) so i was left alone. I went back in and changed, did a lap around thishalf of the 1st floor waiting for the bell, and then on the way here Jimmy-Jim-James comes up to me and is like hey r u ok? and im like no not really...he's like well ya kno i didnt mean to hurt ur feelings or anything im like ya i kno, its not that, its just, yesterday i didnt want to play because i was in fucking pain because i got hit by a car this weekend and hes just like OOOh. and im like yeah. and then i go on, well so i wanna be in a good mood and play today n everyone takes the game so fucking seriously and hes just like well sorry and walks away back to lunch. ehh, whatever. it's not like he's one of my close friends....he's not. ive started seeing him that way, but I really don't know why. He's cool, but like, I think he's scared of me or thinks im like a total freak or something. I don't really care. I don't. But yeah...they just HAD to play "Burn", right? Nocera called me Elfie in the hall a minute ago and I almost like forgot I was Elfie. That side of me has died. I think. I know that I am schizophrenic, but like, all these old sides of me are shining back through my big open pores and I cannot minimize them. Haha, that was so corny. Ahh, don't make me laugh. I lerned a new exercise, a meditation one. About putting a hole thru my fucking head. It works. It's hard to explain, so I won't. I don't really know what else to say right now...I've been thinking about taking this journal, because I write in it so much, to a character, and edit it a lot, ya know, but make it like a story. I have been meaning to piece together The Diary of Ellen Chevelle ...but I don't know why I haven't. Probably just the same reason why I have only ever finished two stories. I have a ton! - Ronnie and Nadine - Beautiful People - The Diary of Ellen Chevelle - Sanctuary - In Vegas - that Emily Lime story - that Allen and Delia story - Silent Keegan - the execution story - Tearstain Between part. II etc. I don't ever finish anything. I don't like not being able to finish things.I really don't. I am getting very bored with this journal. I am. I need to motivate myself back into writing in it constantly. I am redoing my site (again) i know. But I am so pleased with this new layout. The last one was all experimental with pics and marquees and such, and I am now making it all work. And yes, I believe a lot of you will be pleased with the new color sheme. I am going to get polls back on it and a personal feedback button, I want my guestbook to fill up with things...comments, questions, suggestions, recommendations, ideas, jokes, stories, "shout outs" haha, or just type in it for the hell of it. My goal will be like 404 (worthwhile) entries/month. Think we can do it guys? I mean, there were 838 hits as of last night, so once it's bigger and better you never know. The bell is going to ring in 2 or 3 minutes, so I better wrap this up. I have something to say about Fitzy and my relationship with him. Something is missing...I don't know what it is. The same exact thing happened with Matt and I. That was the bell. I have homeroom, but gotta publish. Over and out.
I don't like this. I am in the library, though I am starting to believe it is useless to say that every single day in here. You get the point. Anyway, today was dayone of my Reckless Abandonment. Yes, I spoke. I didn't think I wouldn't...I knew I would, I had to. And there were times when I had to give in just to hear my own voice. This will come gradually to me, I know it will. I've known it. Lara is in the library. She is on the computer near the front where Keith usually is. Actually there are two computers there, but only one is ever taken. NOW I KNOW WHY. He is sitting next to me. I am not generally a mean or prejudiced person, I'm not. I just...it's uncomfortable. I'm trying my best here. Anywhere, where's Matt when I need him? Oh no, wait, he's talk to much and make me talk back. Last night I got 194 IMs when my away message was up introducing my silence, and saying that at 404,404 I will return. I still intend to reach that goal, so I will add the nights, the IMs and speak to no one. If you catch me at a good moment on a good day, I will talk to you on the phone. I am getting nausiated. I really am. I don't like sitting here next to this poor kid, I'm sorry. Oh well...as long as I don't puke. Actually, I wouldn't mind puking much. I was planning on fasting today, but in the caf this morning I couldn't stand it, so I ate like a pop tart, throwing a good lot of it at Pedro. So really I didn't each much. But then I had like 1/2 a pack of Skittles and a juice box. Just some glucose to keep me going. I am hypo....hypoglu something. Hold on, I'll so myself some research here while I'm on the computer, and on the other thing Fitzy brought back into perspective so now I have faith in it again. I will just post the info I need into a blog, so I am going to save this entry so far as a draft, then change blogs, get info, publish, then come back if I have time. If not, tally ho. Cherish these words. There may not be many more. Okay. It's called hypoglycemia. Mom said I have it and you can bet your bottom dollar it's true. I am eating in the library...HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT, LITTLE MISS LIBRARIAN? O man, I am on the 2-minutes fast computer, so I have to go in like 3. Keith is humming. Before he had his hand down his pants and I'm sitting here like oh my god you are in a school library. Hehe, nevermind all of this giggling. I don'd get to hang out with Mike today, and I am so bummed. I have a BATgirl sticker from the doctor. Gtg, that was the bell. Adios. Over and out.

I am sitting here at the father's and I am listening to Candy Kid's Skool of Eurostyle cd. It is soo good. I put all my bracelets back on, chilled with Oliver for a bit. HE IS GETTING SO BIG. Subs don't help my little sensitivity problem, but osiewell b/c ther are good wit good techno man! I am talking to Matt and Mike and Greg. Greg's getting me more CDS! YAY! He's so awesome. Mike and I didn't hang out today, cuz of Dr. Kearney's. And TM he doesn't think we should chill b.c i have rehearsal until 330 and he doesn't want to wait and he wants to hang out with Sam and I am really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really bummed. I really want to go hang out with him. I am so sad. I am getting sadder and sadder. And Fitzy has my little gold box. No one cares if I leave my journal for a while, right? From here on in, I surrender. I am abandoning my voice tonight. Do not, I repeat...do not miss me. (Why would you?) bloodstained16: im assuming this has to do with your whole withdrawing thing or something. every time i ever did that it only made my situation worse. i tend to need ppl, contact with them and being able to express myself to them including through talking. but hey, w/e works for you. This is goodbye. Jaked. Love and Sex, P.L.u.R.R. Tally ho, adios. I'm done...turn me over. Over and out.

I just remembered to say goodbye. I hope this is goodbye. Jaked.
Well hello there fellow Americans. I am in the library and sick to my stomach and chewing this same piece of gum that I have been chewing since this morning but I can't stop chewing something all day or else my jaw will lock up because the dentist popped my jaw out of place and it hurts. Matt is sitting here with me YAY. He has the trenchcoat. I have missed that fucking thing. Urm, last night I made the rounds on the telly...Mike beeped in on my phone call with Matt and he was freaking out and not doing good so I hung up with Matt and went back to Mike and was there for him as best I could, until I started getting fucked up too. It was the storm. Something about that fucking storm. I started hallucinating really really badly last night, things were dancing, changing color, bleeding rainbow blood. I won't get into it, but it was weird. The energy in my room...Lust. It was fucking with me. Like I said, it is the most powerful. It truly is. I wouldn't dare fuck with it, but it fucked with me. I threw up all the energy that was in my because it wasn't good. Then Fitzy called and we talked about it and I don't know...it was bad. I passed out quick though. This morning I work up and my right hand was swollen, red, and it hurt. I took all of my candy and bracelets off. Things like that. We left for school, my stomach still mostly empty because I could barely eat with my fucking jaw like this. I shouldn't have eaten at all, esp. after puking because the I could meditate and be able to channel energy easier...I'm getting back into the Psychic Vampire groove that I used to be in. And I love it, because I have greater control over energies. Thie means I will have to start fasting again. If I use this to my advantage, I can rise out of this depression, I can fix things, change things. Be myself again. Have control, and actually use it. In Gym today, I decided to silence myself...through voice, not through expression. I will type in my journal more than ever, and I will write, advertise myself, let the world see what I want them to see of me. Of my thoughts. Know what? I know it's not practicla to be completely silenced, then I would be a hypocrite and join Steve the Mute in his delightful muteness. WHoooY. Matt is mean and is keeping me from typing. Blahhhh...but yeah, I will keep to myself more and more as time goes on. I lost my necklace from Fitz this morning. I don't know what heppened...it wasn't around my neck when I reached for it, I FREAKED. I needed it's energy. I found it on my last period class, A, and I don't know how it got there because I had it last night and everything. Its energy has changed, it is emptier. I have to fix it. I like this power. I also like how I am getting annoyed with Matt not shutting up and by the way that was SARCASM if you didn't notice, but yep. I hope this is goodbye. Ahh and si, it is. Tally ho.
Hey I have just a quick question...or did, can't remember it now. I was going to have everyone post a comment or two with answers...now I forget. I might as well bullshit one while I'm here. I need a little boost... What is like the best part about me? Like, take that anyway you want, but I want honesty and details and stuff. I just need a little cheering up. If I think o' the cool question I had I'll letcha knowzles. Tally ho. (Actually Tally's not a ho.) ps: MBCSkater: megan MBCSkater: HEY!!! MBCSkater: megan MBCSkater: megan MBCSkater: megan MBCSkater: megannnaaaa MBCSkater: megan MBCSkater: MEGAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MBCSkater: HEY U SEXY FUCKER!!! MBCSkater: OK FINE!!! MBCSkater: BYE MBCSkater: I FUCKIN LOVE U!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (all them s are :-*s) Ya all love me and you know it. Ovurr and out.
Thank God I got to the computer. C Block after lunch, Ms. Barry, OUT OF NOWHERE is like "I AM SICK OF YOUR MOOD SWINGS! YOU'RE A GOOD STUDENT, BUT I CAN'T TAKE YOUR MOOD SWINGS ANYMORE! EVERYONE HAD PROBLEMS! YOU HAVE TO GET OVER IT AND MOVE ON!!" and I had said nor shown any sign of a "problem" or even any kind of anguish really, not much difference than I regularly am in there..I burst out in tears, I snapped. I weeped, sobbed, I couldn't breathe. For the rest of the period. And then she made all her little "doodle" jokes b/ me and Stephanie are always doodling well sorry we are two of the 8 kids in your class that are passing and you fucking take all your anger out on us!? I really really cried and cried, and Jake walked me to D, where I cried so so so so so so so much more. Patt cheered me up, and I am really grateful that he did because I couldn't cry forever. I'm not that much of a Dani Webster. Anyway everyone over here is completely serious about this move. Most likely it's looking like we'll end up in Agawam, we drove by the high school and everything tonight, *tear*. K0819KT: your not moving K0819KT: i dont care wat u say..u come live in my closet After school I got a call from Fitzy and we talked about everything in my last entry and it was nice. He really is sooooooooooooo great. I just, I don't know. I have to sort out all of these feelings. I'll admit, I am crazy for Mike all over again, and remember the pain he put me through, I couldn't stand it again. I mean, I have gotten so much stronger so it wouldn't be so bad, but still. Why go through it if I don't have to? That's Mike's like, ONE flaw I guess. The only one I've really seen at least. Um, but yeah. I just have to figure this all out. then I went to the D E N T I S T (ayye) not fun!! Only, I went in and they numbededed me up and it hurt cuz he put the novacaine in a badd spot. Dr. Lai, this new guy, is awesome. I've had like 8-10 fillings/refillings with Dr. Houle, and he never gave me enough novacaine and it suckededed. But last time, with this new guy, he kept on givin me it. He was like do u want more? do you want more? I'm like PFF YEAH I DO. And that one, which was a really bad one, deep, and so like, I slept thru it. I felt nuthin. This one...I endured the pain. I just held so effing tight. Ya know how I explained the vibrations thing? NOT THE BEST PLACE. Though, I decided that I'm going to take this to my advantage...put a meaning to it all...so I listened...to that and FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD !! Oh, Pat Benetar came on. The Pat Benetar thing lately. It's everywhurr. Then I went to Ma's and GREG CAME OVA!*~* I gotsted me a CONE!!!!!!!!! Everyone, I would like you to meet CONEY JR. (LOVE OF MY LIFE) He is the bestestestestest ever. (Wo. that was hard to type.) I got like a bazillion Rave CDS and that is sOoOoOoOo awesome [instert getting buffness] YESH! CANDY! SicTransitHero: MATT bloodstained16: MEGAN SicTransitHero: i am not going to central next yurr bloodstained16: GRRRRR YOOOOU!!!!!! (im not really angry at you just very very upset and turning my misplaced emotion into anger) PLEASE DONT LEAVE ME!!!!!! Urm...GUESS WHAT OMG!! THE PADRE HAS A NEW BUSINESS HE IS GOING TO BE THE ICE CREAM MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE IS GETTING A DING DONG CART!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but guess what? Along with losing my school, i am losing my phone :(. I think that thunder means I have 2 choices: 1)go buhbyes 2)death by computer Bruises are showing up on me. On he back of my neck now too. All over. Gotta hide, gotta hide from this world. Hey Fitz, we made it through today...does this mean we're FREE? I'm going to go finish a collage I started called Eternal . It's coming alone eloquently. Heh heh...gonna ring Matt, then Mike, then Fitz. I think that's it. Alrighty. Tally ho.
I am at school in the library...B period lunch, but Katie is not with me as she usually is this lunch. She is mad at me because I told her I am probably not going to be at Central next year but I told her it's not really anything I can control and I don't want to leave! It hit me today that NEXT WEEK (thurs) IS MY BIRTHDAY. 16th, blech......Last GSA for the year is this Thursday, so there goes that which I was looking forward too. My day just keeps getting better and better. Last night Fitzy called and I told him I couldn't talk because Ma was still awake, which she was, so I really couldn't. I told him to go read my journal and I think maybe that was a dumb idea considering the things I've written in the last few entries. Urm, but yeah...he still did. Shit. Shit. Shit. Um, then Mike called and we talked until I think like 3:13 am but I apparently fell asleep and I woke up with the charger cord wrapped around my neck. Scary shit. Um, Tuesday I am "staying after" so me and Mike can hang out b/c we haven't seen each other in about 4 weeks. That sucks. But I woke up to Fitzy's call this morning and he told me about a buncha stuff in the past that has happened to him, situations and stuff and what came of them, and told me to think about it. I know he didn't mean it that way, but it seemed kind of threatening. I hung up with him, got dressed, collected things for escuela and then headed down for the morning bagel...onion. Yummmmmy in my tummy, that's fer sure. But today it tasted like C R A P. :( I was not planning on "remembering" my dose this morning, but I took it anyway. I wanted to just cry aeverything all out for a day and then be better, but I have enough to worry about because OH YEAH I AM IN SOOOOOO MUCH PAIN I CAN BARELY SIT, STAND, WALK, MOVE, etc. Really. I talked to Ms. Kelley 1st block in gym and she said that I could sit out, and that I probably have lots of internal bruising, which makes sense. She said its normal that when you get hit by a car you don't feel the effects for a few days. True, true. She said something I'll never forget to me this morning...It's rare I remember things like this...but she said "You are lucky. Not lucky, blessed ." (And then a volleyball hit me hard in the side of my face, no lie, perfect timing." But yeah. I told Teej what happened, and Maureen was around. I told Tasia, I told Steph (B) and Michelle and Ms. Kelly obv. . .I told Kris and Josh in Math 3rd block...holy shit today is going by fast. Josh said that I am fucking stupid as hell for not going to the hospital, and he's all "START WALKING!!" and I'm like I AM NEVER WALKING ANYWHERE AGAIN AS LONG AS I LIVE OMG...[fear]...no...[TERROR]. Ooie, I haven't typed much yet and lunch will be over soon. Lessee....urm....I told Arcadio and he told me about some time when he was little and a car ran over his face or something, I don't know. Then I pulled out a folder of things to go through and my 5th gr. class pic was in thurr for sum reason and so everyone in G block like had to look at it (including Dowd) I'm like oh my god........blah. Now it's B and we have to do McBeth McBETH McBETH!! AND I HOPE OUR THEATER GETS FUCKING CCURSED FOR ETERNITY...as long as I am not here next year. I've been thinking about it, and I'm okay with switching schools...This kid is sitting on the comp. next to me and out of the corner of my eye I can see him looking over at me like every 5 seconds. Not sure if I mind or not. I saw Matt on the way down to B but he was with *Nicci so I didn't get a hug or to talk to him or nuffin. Argh. I am shaking real bad. I really hope both Katie and Fitzy stop being mad at me. I don't know what to do or say! I'm like having this really bad luck streak or something, I don't know, but it's not cool. Fitzy gave my my birthday present early when I was over yesterday and it is a necklace and it is absolutely gorgeous and I love it so much and it had THE best energy...I have barely let go of it all day. A picture of Josh in A with those weirdo sunglasses he had on keeps popping into my head. I made a collage last night, it was really gorgeous. The background was all strips of black and white pictures all shredded and pretty...that took about 2 hours. Then in the corner in like assorted (great word YEAH) pinks and reds is the word YOURS ...There is that terrible vibrating again. I hate it. I am so sensitive to vibrations now...and NO I DO NOT MEAN THAT IN A DIRTY WAY. But every little vibration in anything I'm near, whether it's the motion or the sight or the sound, I see it...all. It's annoying, because I can't think straight when it won't go away...I think it's the printer or the copier, I don't know but it's here every day, just today it's louder. I heard it all thru MCAS last week too. That deff was not cool. I have to wrap this up, I hurt a lot anyway, but I have what, 7 minutes? I don't know, I am not used to 2nd lunch anymore because last week was all 3rds so I adjusted myself to the time period IN DIGITS. I really can't believe Fitzy has my blood. Matt read that and was like HE BETTER FUCKING APPRECIATE THAT!! HE BETTER KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!! And I'm like, from the looks of yesterday, I doubt it. (Should I, baby?) Katie!! PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT ME!! I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU!! YOU ARE LIKE, WOW. You probably know this after the whole Patt escapade and the poem, but I have had the biggest crush on you from day one. I mean, like really. You are so amazing. You are the most gorgeous, beautiful person I have ever seen. I mean it. You are flawless. I can't bear to see you hurt like you are now with this thing with Paul, and I hate when u sing the Oscar Mayer Weiner song all thru B block every day forever and ever but it's all good...You should hear some of the things Patt and I used to talk about...There's the bell... Over and out.

RuneBladeWielder: i.. i love you too
"this is the first and last time he said. she fakes a smile and presses her hips into his..." -Brand New I just got home from Fitzy...I know that this is like my 50th entry today, but oh well. I need this to help clear my head. I'm going to be completely honest and raw about this and no one get mad at me or anything, i dont know. But like, the last few days I have been thinking about this huge change that happened in my and Fitzy's relationship. I...honestly...I wanted to break up with him today. I did. (...sorry, baby...) but I don't know what ("would it be so bad, if u were to pretend that u were so happy?") changed my mind. I don't. I'm still not totally sure. I explained a couple of my cuts to him that I have never told anyone else about...("are you happy? i'll decide. these stories are so old, how they match your eyes...") He has my...stuff that I use for them...he has a bottle of my blood in his closet. I hope he knows what that is to me. My own blood means more to me than anything. I WISH IT DIDNT HURT, HURT LIKE THIS TO SAY THESE THINGS TO YOU. I'LL SACRIFICE ONE MOMENT FOR ONE TRUTH IF WE GET THROUGH TOMORROW THEN WE'LL BE FREE... ITS JUST ANOTHER DAY ONE MORE CHANCE TO GET THIS RIGHT. I'LL SACRIFICE FOREVER PLEASE JUST FOR TONIGHT. IF WE GET THROUGH TOMORROW, THEN WE'LL BE FREE... THE WORST IS OVER FOR NOW TAKE A BREATH NOW LET IT OUT THE WORST IS OVER FOR NOW TAKE A BREATH NOW LET IT OUT THE WORST IS OVER FOR NOW... My thoughts all all just a blur. I got to meet Robin finally, she's wicked cool. She really is. A lot of the time I was with Fitz today I was thinking about Mike unwillingly. He wouldn't leave my head. That used to happen to me real bad whenever I went over Matt's house. Mike is like haunting me or something. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing (fold the corners JUST FOR TONIGHT) and I have a feeling he really doesn't often take the time to read things like my journal so I guess he'll never know that. But it's true. OMJesus I can't believe I spilled that, but yep. I don't like grey anymore. I don't. Not after tonight. Mike: if you were to randomly kiss me next time you saw me, I would kiss you back. I've really come to learn how fast things happen and I'm not going to miss anything because of anything else. I refuse to. (And this is why people cheat.) I don't know what to think. I've finally broken out of my disgusting slut shell but it's all coming back and I think there is only one way to stop it...I'm going to stop typing for a bit, but if I am going to write any more, I will add it to this entry. Greg got me an orange cone. He called "sorry to bother you, but do you want a cone?" Yayness. Alrighty...
Katie G just called me and I told her the news and she just like freaked out, and I told Greg a little bit ago and he was like oh man, I'm sry, r u k? all a that. *he gotted me a bday present!* he's such a sweetie. NEXT SAT. I AM PROBABLY GOING TO A RAVE AT THE PALLADIUM!!!!!!! YOU ARE JEALOUS!!!!!!!! I am so so so so excited. Yay. Maureen just left and I am waiting for Fitz and Robin to come get me....they'll be here in like approx. 8 min. I miss Fitzy. My side has been hurting really really bad but my left side and I fell on my right but I don't get it, I kinda rolled, so maybe like, maybe I pulled something, suggested Maureen. I don't know, but it kills. And dumb ex-pill-popper Megan is immune to ibuprofen and such becuz she used to pop on avrg. like 8 a day just to be numb. Ehh, I can bear it, it's just sucky. Maureen has a new flame. His name is Jay and he is 20 and I am worried about her. I hope to God he's not another "fagit". I know he's too old, but i dont know, maybe he's okay for her. I know I can't protect her forever and she has to make her own mistakes, but I am her Angel. I can't let her get hurt. I can't. I love her too much. She calls Ma "Mom". Hehe. I owe her a fish...M.J.E.D.B. is the fishes name. One of those goldfish with the humongus eyes chillin on the sides of its face. Mjedb stands for MaryJane Eric Deroche Begley. Wow. I've never had a fish named after me before, so I'm pretty damn prouda that one. I just put on Finch because I want to hear "Project Mayhem"...another good song for all you song stealers to steal. I should probably wrap this up because Will Kulig just called me and OH MY GOD I hope we don't move to Chicopee becuz then I'll have to go to his school ew. Urm..know what? They found a house they really really like in Agawam...its supposedly great n I get a room bigger than one square foot, but yep. It's near W E S T*S P R I N G F I E L D yay. Okies. Fuck this...this music is happy and turning me on and I am leaving and I am going to show Fitz this picture book I drew yesterday called "My DAY" and its about my day yesterday, go figure. I typed it all out all about it but it was in the big long entry I wrote this morning and so it is lost. I miss Fitzy. Okies leaving. Adios. Turn me over.
"I am thinking its a sign that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images and when we kiss they're perfectly alignesd. I have to speculate that God himself did make us into corresponding shapes like puzzle pieces from the clay..." -The Postal Service Maureen is here, she has been here for a while, and when she arrived she gave me a really really big tight warm long hug making sure that I was okay after yesterday and it made me feel really good because it's great to know someone I care about so much cares about me too. We put on Eminem and listened to "Squrr Dance" and "Superman" and made rull messy ice cream sundaes and it was yummy and then we planned to open our own ice cream shop and have lots of whipped cream and have whipped cream fight...ya know, the spray kind...it will be soo much fun!! We listened to MSI and like random crazy shit and she played "turning japanese" on the piano and I was exited and then we listened to 99 Red Balloons and all of that. And now she is lying on the couch behind me, probably looking at my ass for all I know and she looks really pretty in the sunlight slipping through the blinds. We're listening to The Postal Service (obv) and now she is playing gamecube...Hopefully I can go to Fitzy's later on tonight, Robin will pick me up, if I can get a ride homw, but like, I dont know...I feel bad, like I blew him off for Maureen or whatever but it's not my fault!! It's not!! I can't type long because I don't want to neglect her too. I feel like such a bad friend/girlfriend... "tell me am i right to think that there could be nothing better than making you my bride and slowly growing old together...?" -TPS I really feel like I've been like a bad girlfriend or whatever. I feel like cutting off all my hair right now, but guys, I have found my reason to keep it and grow it out...I want it to grow super long so I can braid it and whip it around while I dance and at raves and things. Anywho...it dawned on me last night that I don't think I could marry Fitzy. Really. I mean, I'm not ready to be a fucking girlfriend, and deff not a mother (:-/ ayye) though I thought I would make a great wife I can't. I really cant. (Sorry, baby) I can't. I can't even be someone's girlfriend without fucking up. I rully can't. :( Now I feel like CRAP so I'm not going to write much more. She is still playing gamecube. She wrote me another poem and I scanned it and yeah, I'll upload it later. She is so amazing...her words touch something in me I can't describe...it's like 10 minutes to 3 so I have to turn down the tunage. BRB (have you figured that one out yet??) SicTransitHero: i got hit by a car yesterday applejak010: lol applejak010: i mean applejak010: that's terrible jerk. ehh, wuteva. I am so sick of this TPS business. I am going to put on some random tunagegegegege...o.O nope I like this song. After this. I think the fam is home, but then again, I've been hearing things every two seconds so fer all I know I'm crazy. Like fo shizzle. Video gamage off. Maureen is sleeping on the floor. She is beautiful...:) I remember when we were at the mall one night and I was "sleeping" at the table in the food court and her and I think Mike Howell were sitting there and she was talking about "how often do you get to watch a pretty girl sleep" and I was like in complete awe because that was the first time that there was any sign whatsoever that she liked me and I've liked her so much for so long, so yeah. Umm hey, the fam is home...so I think like I might as well just sign off altogether. P.L.U.R.R. luv n sex. adios. turn me over.
"Hold me now, it's hard for me to say I'm sorry. I just want you to stay..." I am listening to Candy Kid's Blood Has Been Shed disc and it is so good and it's really loud and Maureen is on her way over and I am excited but paranoid that she's randomly shown up and I can't hear hur. Ahh, she's not. I am loving this, attempting to rave, but I am all achey in my side from yesterday. Blechh. I have a gross taste in my mouth from thaat weirdo alien juice that I drank this morning. Ewwie, brb. (While I'm gone, try to pernounce BRB.) okies, I have choc. ice cream which I don't even like but oh wellllls. I talked to Fitz again and he asked me like what I thought of the journal he kept last week and stuff, and like, how do you answer questions like that?! Seriously, like, sometimes you don't think about stuff, you feel it, or just observe it instead of expeirence it and such. Or sometimes you can't even explain it. Like, you really really honestly truly don't know. *~*To all thuh (pernounce that-a one) ravurrs in thuh nation*~* I don't have anything to say, so I will just ramble on and on randomly. There are little bunnies on my bracelet, bunnies are the bestist evur! Zippety-doo-dah. I think Fitz is mad at me. Our relationship is all screweded up like energy wise. Ehh, hopefully it'll revive itself. Hopefully. I really do love him. He is amazing. I am sweaty. After this I will put on TPS and maybe, urm, BD. But that will make me sad so maybe TPS n thats it...WHERE'S MAUREEN? ice cream ice cream ice cream ice cream...I wish I could tell what the voice in this techno is saying. I don't really care actually, the beat is great as is all good techno...obv. ~LUDA~ heh, urm, Next Sat. there is a rave and I want to go so I will get $25 and go with Greg . It's all ages so I don't have to wait until I'm 16. Ladeda, I will be 16 soon OH NO.!.!. I am scaredededed to drive, I am. So I will get my permit and then wait a year or 2 before I start driving. I have to keep stopping typing to eat some ice cream. ~LUDA~ urm,my hair is dry now. This morning I washed my hair in the sink to straighten it and got CONDITIONER IN MY EYE and then Matt went and said CORNEAS n I'm like AAHHHHHHHHHHHH because it was really scary. What if I died fer real? Every one/thing is out to get me these days. Uurrbuddy (in the club gettin tipsay) WHAT WHAT!? Hardcore muthafucks hahahahaha. Whooee. I just deleted a whole buncha HHHHHHs so that you don't get upset even tho u probably are already because you are just so damn concerned with my well being. Oh my goodness, oh me oh my, where is MAUREEN? My wrist hurts now too. Know what? Know what? kNoW wHaT? my cuts are mostly all healeded. I tried to tell myself I wouldn't do it anymore, for me, for Fitz...that's about it. But it's an addiction, ya know. Look at all the muthafucks ((haha)) that r like "im quitting smoking" like everyuutha day n then u see em outside sucking down cancer sticks like theyre....like theyre....like they're cancer sticks. I am going to put on The Eminem Show now. I know, you are jumping for joy even though you can't hear it and I can!! I WIN! ZIPPETY DOO DAH!! MAUREEN IS HERE!!!!! Yay! Yay! Yay! Okies, adios. Turn me ova.
The fam is off for a few hours and I am being the reason why they are moving, they just don't know it. :-D Fitz rang just as they were leaving, so I am stuck at home with permission to invite only female friends over...dun wry guys, we'll be good. Hopefully Indie and Sam will come over. Maureen's got her away message up so I don't know. My mom said girlfriendS...heh heh...I love people that don't realize exactly what they're saying. Alright, well LEN is skipping and I am going to eat and I am blech now because I had to relive the accident again for Fitz...bblech. Okay, well here I go eating u out of house and home and then *painting. Turn me over.
Right now I love: 1. "Steal my Sunshine" 2. The blue paint all over my fingers from last night 3. "Steal my Sunshine" Right now I hate: 1. Blogger 2. Blogger 3. This POS keyboard 4. Ma nd Craig sucking face in the kitchen 5. Blogger 6. The "I am away from my computer right now." away message. How very redundant. 7. Blogger 8. That I probably won't get to see Fitz today :( :( 9. See #2 10. See above. 11. Family 12. Aches and pains and trauma 13. That this Venga Boys song has a sound effect of like VRRROOOOOM. 14. This Venga Boys song. Actually, not. 15-34. Blogger 35. The tears all dried around my eyes that feels weird. 36. The VRRROOOOOOM thing 37. I suddenly crave The Rasmus. Hmm. 38. Onomatopoeias 39. "Come as You Are" 40. Blogger 41. This list. Turn me over.
I hate Blogger now, I really do. Or this midget crap keyboard. I really am crying over this one. I typed a LONG significant entry and out of nowhere, IT'S GONE. I know my journaling on here is just for me to get it all out, but I'm a packrat with words and my hidden feelings too. This is not good. It was really really long. Forget it. I am not typing it again. That would just defeat the purpose all together. This is why I left Blogger the first time, last year in "Lost in the Shuffle." I surrender. Turn me over.
I hate missing days in here. Argh. Mall last night, cool...made friends with Kittie, that was neat. Eh, hung out with Mike and Sam and Matt and DJ and Indie and Steve I guess mostly all night. And Crystal. I am going to give Slipknot a chance. Um...mom got my a black light fer my room and it is sooooooooo fun cuz it lights up the entire litte 1ft x 1ft room and so much of my stuff glows in it. it is soooooo awesome, you have no idea. We ordered the party kit, and it's like a vamp thing so it'll be pretty swell. Last night i took caffiene pills and got really bad heart pains. I painted*. No one knows what that means yet. My book of paintings* I hae decided I will not give to anyone. I wrote a poem about Mike and Sam last night, soon I'll get a lot of these new poems into MAiM guys, don't worry. On the 3rd, I broke up with Fitzy. I am tired and way out of it so I am going to go. plur megan vladimir star butterfly laroache creepy megan the lesbian mookie joe
Look up the lyrics to The Postal Service's "Nothing Better." That's all I have to say. Goodbye.
HEEEEY! HAPPPPYYY BIIIIRRTTTHHDAAAAYYY MMMEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! I am excited. I am a whopping 9 years old today! Haha I told Ms. Barry that and she was like, huh? She got mad confused, it was AWESOME. F-gym, walked the track reading, with Katie and Debra and OH YEAH and Marcelino. Katie TACKLED me in the locker room. Like a full on tackle. G-slept. A-hahahah "instant messaged" wil...on paper, with the instant message boxes drawn and the screen names adn *ands and direct connections and like pop up ads and links and knock knocks and junk. it was funny. Btw, Irish is pregnant with Josh's baby. Good to know. B-acting, found out I didn't have to do MCBETH in the show on friday. Speaking of, last night was our play. Intense. I GOT DRENCHED in ketchup. It was soooooo gross. It was everywhere and it reeked and it didnt even look like decent blood. Hahahahahaha. Sucks for me, I know. Anyway, other than that last night wasn't that much fun except for doind personality quizzes with mom and craig about can u pick up love signals and "do you spark or leave no mark?" and I said, hey mom, I must cause a spark because REMEMBER MARK? I LEFT HIM. I mean, He dumped me, but in my head we were already waaay broken up. What a waste of so many kisses, Man. OH YEAH, AND SPEAKING OF MARK AND B BLOCK, MARK WAS THERE!!! at Central, with Josh. I must admit, he looked really hot. But like, he was all "Hi Megan." I'm like SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME. and he says happy birthday and then i say thank you all delightfully and walk away. Goin out to buses, he was thurr again wit josh (l) and like, I went over and gave him a hug and he did his little "hey" and then is like so now u give me a hug. and i let go and walked away. AJ is hot, he actually like talked to me today for the first time in so long. We used to be cool, now i guess its sorta kinda maybe gettin back to that which is coooooo cuz hes a coooo kid. Mom gave me Anne Sexton's complete collection of poems today. I was sooo excited. She is GODDESS. Omg. and she gave me pop tarts, the good kind, and made me breakfast. It is really hot out hurr in the office and every one probably wants to spend time with me because today is like acknowledge megan cus she is the best ever day. Obv. Gena sang the best birthday song ever: G:Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. I don't know your name. Me: Vladimir. G: Huh? Me: Vladimir. G: Huh? Me: V-L-A-D-I-M-I-R G: Vlahhhuh? Me: (sigh) Joe. G: Happy birthday dear Joooeeeee....um. Happy Birthdayyyyyyyyyyyyyy.....
Library, Tueday morning, but you already knew that. I was so surprised it was lunchtime. I have noticed that the days after I pull an all-nighter I am wide awake and energized the whole next day. One would think I would be exhausted and the day would go by slow, but I guess not. I think that's a good thing, because I can't wait for this day to be over with. Oh yikes (bikes!.....nvm) I just remembered I have to stay after for rehearsal till (5?)...Eh, I think it's six. Josh got me thinking. Josh Bobrowski, Banana Josh...he saw my thousand (technically 50) pieces of extremely bright and colorful candy and he was talking about Ephedrin. I htink that's how ta spell it and junk. But yesh, him and Dave started talking about it and though I know it's bad for me, the whole...experimental thing is not completely out of my system. I don't know what I am going to do. I go to the mall every week or whatever, I don't even know anymore, and try to pry myself away from the CVS that I love because I always want to get more of that stu Reason for the above's random stopping point: The LIBRARIAN. Here, I'll play it out for you. [Type type type, Me. Librarian (L) comes and sits at the computer NEXT TO ME even though there was no one on any of the other computers on that entire side of the library. Me, (M) Type type type, trying to ignore her ewwwwyness. L leans over so obv.ly and annoyingly to see what I am doing...I try to keep typing.] L: What are you doing? M: Same thing I am in here doing every day, typing. L: What are you typing? M: Umm, a short story in the form of a journal. [L reads the above journal entry thouroughly.] L: Who are you working for?? M: [insert extrememly puzzled look here] Myself... L: You're not telling me the truth. M: I'm not? L: No, I know what Blogger is. M: Okay....do you want me to just get off the site? Because I will. L: This is a story? M: Mhm. L: Let me see the rest of it. M: Do you want me to just get off the computer altogether? Because I will, really. L: I want you to show me the story. [She sits back down at her lovely little computer, don't ask me why after she asked to see something on mine...but anyway, I save it as a draft really quickly so I didn't lose it and clicked over to the page of all the posts' titles.] M: It's all choppy, you can't see it all together. But here it is. L: [Staring at her screen still] You're not telling me the truth. M: Yes, I really am. What else do you want me to say? L: You're not telling me the truth. M: Yes, I am. I type entries like one or two times a day, depending on whether or not I can get to the city library after school because I have a hard home life. My writing is all I care about and here is really the only place I can concentrate and get things done. So I type the entries, then later when I can...which isn't often...I edit them to shape them around a character. Most of this isn't editted yet because, like I said, I have little access to this. L: You're not telling me the truth. I know what a blogger is. M: Okay, well I only use the blog space to store the little bit I get done so I can get it on any computer because I have no one place to save it to. L: You're not telling me the truth. M: I don't understand. I'm in here doing this everyday. I know that's what it is. L: [patheticly fake sigh] All you have to do is admit you are typing an email and I will leave you alone. M: Look...[cracks voice dramatically] I am not trying to be rude, but I'm really not. There's not email addresses or anything on the screen, you can come check. I'll get off the computer if you want...really... L: No, I know you're not rude, but... I think after that I blocked her out because I have no clue what she said, nor do I care, as entertaining as this all is. I mean, what kind of librarian makes it against the library rules to check out books??? Isn't that what a library is for??? But anyway I stared at the screen saver scroll across the screen again and again and again and I will never go back in the library because of the screen saver. Spfld. Central High School - Do Not Change System Settings! Ick. So then I watched the letters dance and change colors as they went, I'm not kidding about this part either. And I watched the lights in the background that I could see reflected in the black of the comp. screen were turning in to things. This is pretty normal for me to see things like this, but know what? It was entertaining. I could feel her looking at me every 2 seconds, so I turned and caught her looking at me and she didn't look back. :-D. Intimidation. Easy in cases like this, where she thinks she has it over you, but just a look can turn the tables. Enough of that. I went to the other periods, and it was cool in D because she handed out a new book and on the book card I got the # for the Mango Street book I lost so I could turn in the one I stole claiming to have the right number and save my fourteen dollars. Nothing really super bad or super good happened today, I guess. I got a lot of recognition for all my candy, which I stayed up last night to make. This thing about Josh and the pills, I don't know. I'm still tearing apart the idea in my mind for some kind of no-matter-what-this-is-a-no-no reason. But I don't have one yet. E period sucked. F period, ehh, volleyball. Whatever. Jose and Kat and Chi were thurr so it was cool. I skipped afterschool rehearsal, as did everyone. What would we have accomplished without the entire cast? I'd still be there now...for the whole next hour or so. I came home and couldnt stomach a whole thing of Ramen, so I like, ick. Ow. Still feeling that one. Yesterday was Paul's bday. Today is Joe's bday. Tomorrow is Josh and Jer's bday. THURSDAY IS MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAY? I get to pick a friend or two to come to NoHo for all day Sat. My first thought was Fitz and Sam...but Fitz will be at realms and Sam...well, that would be nice just to hang out for a day. Esp. in NoHo. Me and Fitz, I'm kind of confused. Last I heard we are on a break, or talking about taking one, I don't even know where it ended...so I am saying that we are together for the time being until I can be sure. I am being optimistic about this thing as much as I can be. I don't know what else to say, but I'm on a roll with this entry, it has been a while, I know, and NO I am not explaining my entire weekend. Not sure if I did or not. This afternoon Mom came by to drop stuff off and her and me and dad were talking and he was talking about me missing a dose and how i can't do that and tho i have (i.e. the PADRE thing.) But yeah..that convo wasn't the highlight of my afternoon. He said in the mornings and such or when I miss a dose I am "fit to kill"...yes, yes, yes, yes I am...though I am pretty good about not becoming a psycho killer. In C, Mike Gilligan was talking about how his dad's friend used to get picked on and beat up by all the black kids at his school so one day they were supposed to beat him up and this kid (his dad's friend) came to school on PCP and ripped off a locker door and beat the the kids nearly to death. He got a 30 day suspension and no one messed with him after that. I just think the locker door part is sexy. Dad wants me to go do a load of laundry, so I gotta make this quick...or I can save it, do that, come back and add. Ehh, whatever. I have been getting really bad back pains. Really bad. I just took off all of my candy and I feel weird. My play is tm night. Ew. That sucks. Ehh, whatever. No one really cares. Really, they don't. I don't even care. I am all sweaty, so I am gonna jump in the shower when I'm done with the laundry. This is to you as the Ramen was to my stomach. Wait...ew, If that's true, sorry. I should have shut up days ago. Well I might as well just blow this popsicle stand now. I don't really like popsicles. I just realized how dirty all of this was. Haha. Shush. Esp. you Marky-Mark-Jimbo kid. Over and out...
Hello. Earlier entry lost. Not in the mood, but how common is that these days? This is for Dove. I'm sorry. *Holds you*...it's alright... To Chances at Life You're dancing so graceful with my libido and grieving– your head held high, your warm chest heaving. Come sit with me on the roof roleplay under imaginary Stars. I couldn't catch your spirit in a hundred thousand jars. All I wanted was to suck the salt from your TeArStAiNd SoUl. All you really needed was to be controlled. Your wish has become a demon's command. The ounce of angel in him kisses your hand. Hand over your little TeArStAiNd SoUl and he'll protect you, he'll console. This tears me up inside like a sugar hurricane. Jesus Christ, what I'd give to make out with you in the rain. In a field of Venus Fly Traps and daisies, your sweet insanity radiates among all the crazies. I'll wear your halo around my ring finger and glow. Your smile melts the Krystil frost, let's watch the world overflow. Wrapped in Matt's white shirt, a fallen Dove. Such a perfect target for my unworthy love. So unworldly, you traipse the mall. Like a stupid Star, I stumble and fall. (But only for you) I come unglued. Your adhesive heart, all the sticky things you do. You're like an illness, invading everyone's cells. Focusing in on your stillness, eyes filling fast like wells. Like drugs to the bloodstream, I've held on to you, but the only trip I get is a guilt trip from you. The razors that you cut with are still in your possession. Snug in your pocket despite your confession. These cuts on my stomach don't hurt so bad anymore. This pain is a million times worse than before. Like all 99 red balloons, I have to let you go. So take your feathers, your razors, your tiny halo. I'll stay here and forever obsess. A broken heart is better than none, I guess.
Sam...look, I really still like you...so damn much. I don't know what do act like around you...You just get me all screwed up inside. Blech. I am sitting here, it's just after midnight, and I am about to go to sleep because I am not even supposed to be on the computer but I am pist because I went to print a binder-size version of my book and the printer dies right on poem like 29 or something so now I have to wait or I have to print it off Dad's (When he's not around, of course) or I don't knwo what I am going to do. I'd have someone else do it for me or priint it upstairs if Mom wil let me tomorrow, but she doesnt even wan me turning on this damn computer tomorrow because it is dying so bad. No sound will work on it even. I am sick and tired of Jamie stealing all my fucking shit. I am. Patt is being all pissy at me and I dont know whay and I cant stand that. Someone, anyone, telling me to leave them alone for any reason makes me want to cry so very badly...that's what I am going to run off and do. I have bad cramps, and not only that, but I want to vomit so badly. I'm not in good shape here, guys. I hope Ma just let's me sleep tomorrow because I need it. Bad. -Bang'
I love Atmosphere. So much. Once again, I don't really feel like typing, but I'll leave this window minimized and keep coming back to it...this morning I was wicked like, blech. Well, I might as well say this afternoon. I didn't get up until after 12. No, I am not about to start up about my dreams. Way too weird, and way too many of them. Wo. Seriously, folks. But yeah, this morning I was about to smoke one of Matt's cigarettes. I didn't because not only is that disgustingly gross, but I know myself, I 'd become instantly addicted and because I like being able to mean it when I say I've never smoked anything in my life at all...ever. (And I dont ever plan on it!) Tithe has hit a dull spot. I need to get through this book, need some more focus. It really is that great, it is! GOD LOVES UGLY! Yesterday I had the WORLDS WORST cramps. Omg, I have never had cramps that bad before, it was WEIRD. It sucks. Last night I must have dont something severly wrong because 1. Sam wasn't wearing the bracelet...i guess i didn't really expect her to, but still. 2. she wouldnt even let me say goodbye. i like her so much, but i always seem to screw something up. I cant type great, my computer is being slow my apologies. i think i'm just gonna let you go. i guess. god loves ugly.
I don't really wanna explain this all. Mike, this is all screwed up. Be with Krystil. I mean, I wasn't expecting you to be with me or anything...but God. And now Dove is all...I don't even know. Got 2 Atmosphere CDs. In love. I don't know what else I sould really say, NO MATT. No. I got matt's cigs so he can't smoke them. I will probably throw them out. They are bad. I showed off my *paintings tonight. No one knows where they came from...not the surface of my skin, not my veins.... that *paint was out of my fucking SOUL. My heart...(no wonder it hurts so bad lately...LITERALLY...im not even kidding.) Tithe is so good, Oliver's doing alright. Oochie wally wally. I'm gonna just leave it at that. I want to VoMiT. -BangBang
Sadness is disgusting. Misery is an ugly, wretched, twisted, sick beast. Pain is so gross. It is NOT EXQUISITE. It is NOT BEAUTIFUL. Today, *cSHEc* said something like "Death is a beautiful thing, embrace it." While these girls were huddled under an umbrella in the rain, one of them was on a cell phone. They were haveing a moment of silence because someone died. And *cSc* was MOCKING them by doing what she always does...she was trying to be noticed as so dark. It's not her and she can't see that because she has not felt real pain, no real suffering. Wait until someone she loves to death dies... Then let her see how BEAUTIFUL it is, when her loved one is rotting six feet underground with maggots crawling through their eyes and ears and out their nose. While the worms lay eggs in their belly button and people through their McDonald's bags and cigarette butts on the ground above them, making the soil so filthy that nothing could ever grow their again to be lessed with even a blade of grass or a dandelion. When she wanted to go see them and give her best wishes the tears will burn her eyes out and make her a thousand times more wretched than she is, and she'll have to squat down on a patch of nothing but dirt to look at her reflection in the tombstone-her reflection...the ugly rotten dirty "beautiful" death she wants to be so badly...which, by the way, is covered in grafitti. I hope she has nightmares about an angel that will come and kiss her on the mouth and then vomit on her, sickened by all the death-germs on her lips. And that angel will twist and gnarl its limbs all up and she will become a gross, knotted wreck that will strangle her with happiness and she will scream because she thinks it's music when she sings...and then the angel-beast will remind her how when she wanted a nickname so bad I said I'd call her "Misery" and from then on she chopped off al her hair and her face broke out in a thousand death-blemishes (which scarred like bite marks from a cherub) and she started wearing beaded jewelry along with her ankhs...the essences of which choke her while they swing from her thickening neck because they mean LIFE LIFE LIFE. and all she thinks she wants to do is be beautiful. she was, until she decided to maim herself into horridness and then scream at the living for not loving it. The only way now, that she can be beautiful, is deep underground, with all the maggots and worms wriggling through her stinking rotting flesh and she'll try to smile with her disgusting fossil jaw while the living, the truly gorgeous, drive by. She thinks they adore her, when really they just bless her with their cigarette butts and trash and gag at the sight of her stupid patch of dirt because that is what she wanted. Death. How exquisite is that?
Today has been a day full of omens, good and bad, I think, though I am not sure. This morning I went with Mom to see the new house... -The little old lady in the shoe thing in the kitchen -Mom's shirt -The windshield wipers -"Poison Ivy" ...I have something and mom thinks it's poison ivy and it's weird and I bet it's just an allergic reaction but I don't know. We drove back to her house, I got cream stuff, ate... -Mom got a call from Matt....something happened. There was a fire in the kitchen...in the panic, someone dropped the baby and he stopped breathing...they took him to the emergency room, Matt had to go to Fitchburg, Dad was all shooken up, Jackie stayed with Nic at the house. That's all I knew. I cried. School...showed up for C block, Spanish. Nothing that happened then was significant enough for me to explain. D-realized I didn't have my story stuff on me, couldn't read in that class, so I just sat there. E-tested...but that class never changes. F-sat and read and fell so deeply into Tithe...oh my God. Why did I think Sweetblood could be my favorite book. Wow. Went out to the bus, it was so very very late. Forget the rest of the omens I guess.... Dad came home with Deb and he told us in detail what happened, I will not explain it here...we all bawled so much, my head hurts so very very bad and my hands itch...My stomach hurts of hunger somehow, eben though I have been eating like a PIG, but oh well. Cramps, PMS, the works. You know how it is. I don't have much time, this typing is like, bleccch...I can't focus, see...I have to keep hitting the backspace key. Over and over. I'm gonna wrap this up. I'll be at the hospital all night with Oliver...so you can try to call me, but I can't use the cell phone inside the hospital, so depending on where I am I may or may not get to talk to you...depending on whether or not I am home before 9:30, I may or may not get back to you, to like, explain last night and tonight and everything. Well, whatever. Scratch that (heh heh) because I doubt I'll be home in time anyway. Really do. I'll be alright guys...it's just really scary when someone you love gets hurt, ya know? There are things in his brain or something they are watching and he will be there over night. Well, I cant bear this stupid journal any more. And I'm off....
I just absolutely had to get back to you. Journal time, much needed. I just found one really old mix cd and I am listening to "Take On Me" and I just realized that I really always have loved this song, it's up there with Konstantine, ya know. Take on me.....Take on me....Take me onnnnn, (Take on me) I'll be gonnnnnnnne. do do do dooooooooooo. I really am feeling so insightful or whatevfer, I won't share, and just for that Matt will comment saying that I should say because he actually cares. Mhm. Sure, Matt. You may actually be the only one. I dont even care. Amy just said we have 10 minutes before take off, so I thought I'd get back to you. Um, I just went out in the garage to close the big door, and there was a box cutter on the table and my breath got all stuck in my throat. I am listening to Default now. I miss this stuff so much. Not all of it, mind you, but whatever. I am so tired. I think I'll fall asleep in the car, but I want to read, so I hate that...falling alseep reading. Unless I'm trying to, ya know. Anyway, I'm gonna go now to go wash up and cool down and change and pack (?) and eat and all of the bare (hehe) necesseties of life. Plus someone just IMed me. Okay, you can have summore love id you want, -Vlad-
Darn is a funny word, darn it. I am all hot and sweaty (but you already knew that)...seeing as you are too. Tougie CARRIED me home from the bus today. Well, not all the way, but when I asked him to I wasn't serious. It was cool. Tougie's a good kid. I am so tired, but I will not complain. I finished The Sisterhood book today, and yeah, it's good, I will admit. I am going to read Tithe now I think, I don't really want to, but this is one damn book I am judging by it's absolutely breathtaking cover. I hope I get to the library on Sat. just to filter out the books I've already read, cuz I have way too many in line for once. I am sleeping with Hilary's mom. Haha. Nevermind. I gotta go to Alyssa's bday thingy tonight in CT, which is good because I will get lots of reading time, and that's what I am really looking forward to. Plus, get ready to laugh aloud...I just said aloud. No but seriously...think about the date. Screw the 200 part. June 9...June is the 6th month. (You: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH HAHAHAHAHAAH HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA AHHAAHAHAHA Megan you are TOO MUCH!!! *Doubling over in laughter* HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA *gasping for air* hahahahahahahah ahahahah!!! hahah!!!! Hey wait *suddenly catching your breath*...that is so hot, [like you, Megan, of course] and it turns me on [like you, Megan, DUH] and so I am going to go find someone hot [like you, Megan...if anyone compares....hmm...screw it, where the hell are ya?!?!?!?] and have one. Adios.) Me: You wish. You: Nuh uh, you wish. Me: Neh, that'k okay babe. I'd fall asleep. You: Nuh uh, you wi--wait, what? Me: *collapses* El scenario neato. Actually so realistic-o. Erm, ok, that reminds me, I had a kind of out-thurr day. 1st block, B-laid on the stage with katie (:-D) and josh and pretrended to do homework...omg i hope i dont forget to actually do this one because I will miss the class time to do it tm!! oh no!! oh well. C-SUNG...no...ACTED OUT AND SUNG "HEAD, SHOULDERS, KNEES, and TOES"...well, in Spanish. Therefore it is: "Cabeza, Hombros, Piernas, Pies." It's sad I know that, is it? *Punches you in the fucking face*...jerk. Mike Gilligan like...oh never mind, you had to be there. D-slept. Wrote...*cough HER cough* a note about hoe she tries WAY too hard to be profound in her poetry and if every other words is 9-11 letters long, who the hell will get the meaning of the poem? It's not poetry if there can be no personal interpretation for the reader, unless it is completely for the poet and no one else. But she flaunts it, therefore, it just dies. E-I was offered 2nd lunch as well as 3rd because of the big BDAY last week, but I loathe lunch, so I got on the computer instead, expecting I would be able to come on here and write and make up for all the lost time or whatever. But Blogger was down and I was PIST. Lunch-I am sleeping with Hilary's mom, lol. Long story. I went outside to all the smoker's new spot or whatever, I dont know, I dont keep tabs on dumb things like that. But anyway, everyone was there and it was cool and Maureen was there and I tried not to think about her because she has a boyfriend (Some Tom, I dont know...) and also Brenda was there, and her presence makes me feel like I'm not supposed to like Maureen. I don't actually really know why. I have to go really soon to leave for CT. o yeah, so F, I just sat and read, no one was doing anything. Stupid lock thing again. G-read, STAYED AWAKE...I know, I never cease to amaze myself. Got to last page of the Sisterhood, the bell rang. Broke a bracelet, sucked, funny, hahah. Went home, the end. Now I am sitting here, covered in sweat and jewels...I feel like Claire...does this mean I will die? (This is weird.) I am going to get going though, I will get back to you, my lovelies, if I am home and concious before 9:30...doubt it, but theres always the chance. I doubt Mike reads this, but if ya do, Call me... This is me turning it all off like the radio. Nevermind. Cuz I guess you'll probably see me again... whether you get it or not, you no one you. Find me. Static or wherever. Love and Sex, minus the sex... -vlad today-
I have so much to say but I have approx. 7 minutes before computer curfew, at which time I have to call greg back and then see if Mike called. I really do have a lot to say. I went to Cookie's graduation just now, then Wendy's which i hate, but o well, and Creepy Kid graduated and I was proud yay, I told him haha ur still creepy but congrats man. N Melissa too...that was cool, she's so pretty. I didn't get to talk to her, or even make eye contact for that matter, but that's okay. Her energy stuck with me (and I don't even have my crystal on me!)...I am wearing NICE clothing, which I may or may not puruse at one point or another. I have this flowery pink thing on with the neck that goes all the way down so your boobs fall out and all the decent people wear like a white camisole under it. I considered not, my boobs havent fallen out of any kind of shirt in a while, but I guess I have some kind of ounce of like self respect or something...I know. A second ago I was freezing, now I'm sweating like gross so I might as well go. like 2 minutes left (I wasted most of my time typing the approx.) ...I really do have a lot to say. I started a paper journal, heh heh...but yep. I guess I need it with this hectic life ive been living somehow. Gonna go medicate and ringaling the peeps. (shoot me). I really gotta go now though. I promise, I will get back to this sometime this week and type a full-fledged entry about everything annd nothing all at once, like old times. Until then... ciao.
This whole, not going to the library thing is really screwing me all up. With like this journal and such, and getting back into the swing of lunches. Plus today Eric (N) like plastered me with mustard. First ketchup, now mustard....i dont even wanna know whats next. Today I worked with dad on the ice cream truck and that is some crazy shit. We saw jess, that was cool. I have a paper that was due this morning, that I haven't even looked at really, and I got out of being in that period because of a dr. appt...that's cool...(she wants to put me on sleep pills now too....*rolls eyes*) Yesterday we went to Osgood's and I talked mom into buying little bits of 12 diff. fabrics to make this skirt out of, right, even though it's made with 12 pieces youre supposed to only do it in like one color or whatever but it doesnt matter, so me and kayla picked out a buncha crazy peices and miraculously they all fit really well and all like scream MEGAN ot VLAD or ELFiE or STAR or whatever you call me. But they do. It's about 1/2 made, and let me tell you Missy, it is a TON of work, but o man it will be worth it...i mean look at the pieces: -Fairies on black -lime green with like spiders and spiderwebs -Polka dots of like all diff. colors on white -a comic strip one and in one of the boxes its like "WHAT ABOUT ME JEFF?" and he's like "WELL...YOUR COOKING STINKS!!" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. -one with a bunch of cats and cat faces -kinds tye-dye-ish darkish green and forest green -deep magenta with black vines all on it -my fav...a black one with like figures of people dancing that are like neon tyedye ish -grand prix lookin one, black and white checkers -tye dye hearts -blue stars -purple with bats i know, sexy. i gotta go work on it. MATT IF YOU ARE READING THIS, CALL ME. I NEED A REALLY HUMUNGOUS FAVOR that involves my stupid paper. You love me, so ya know. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. Gotta go, though, all...Josh T is annoying and I hate his shoe. Have a nice life, I'll be around as soon as possible, my lovelies. Adios.
I am bored. Actually I'm not. I'm only here because I went to go put a new poem in MAiM *curtsy* and entered this blog by habit. But I figured while I'm here I might as well write. Ok, Mistress was messed up so bad and I was mad at her yesterday but she gave me this poem and it made me cry. So I told her FUCK YOU because I was so mad that she keeps telling me I am her angel and asking me to save her, and then doing all of that shit over and over. (nOW I KNOW WHY...thats another story) but anywho...we tend to communiate thru poetry, so here goes. I wrote the following as a response to hers...: "Mistress, this is for you and no one else. The only thing in disguise has been my fear. Maybe I haven't tried hard enough to save you. Maybe I've been so deaf to hear. Or maybe you just don't scream for me anymore. Maybe you don't ask for my assistance. I think that the drugs are just locks and chains and you've grown too weak to resist it. But I don't know what it is exactly, so I don't know what to say. If you still think I'm perfect, I still think you're wrong, but I'll stay here anyway. Let me know..." and then she wrote me back with: "Here I go again crying over your words what was there to scare me into doing this These drugs lock me inside my nothing When I tried to scream I lost my breath just like I lost my heart you Its hard to know whats real anymore Mademoiselle I love you and I need whether I can say it out loud or not I am waiting Angel take me away and save me...." and last night I wrote her a wicked one that is in my bimder sumwhere (ill type it later...maybe...its kinda....INTENSE) but yeah, I just commented in her journal where she put the above poems with this: "Mistress, you've done nothing wrong, unless you consider breathing a sin. Though the air you inhale is filthy and dry, You can blow it back out again. And anyway last night I sat, huddled in the corner of my room, smoking one of Matt's cigarettes and writing a poem for you. It was about feelings and the way I want to fall. It was about passion and the turquoise of your walls. It was about the joint that I'd wish you'd pass to me for once. It was about breaking through the locks that have held me for months. But I don't want to go back, I just want you to step up with me. I don't want that shit to bind you. I just wish I could set you free....." ans that it what I was going to put in MAiM. *DUCKS* but now i am going to die. I am a hypocrite. Aye, I'm sorry guys, it was so gross. Im sorry Im sorry!! EW EW I feel dirty, I feel like BLECH. And my room smells weird now. Last night I kissed Creepy Kid. I think I should go now cuz um...yeah, paranoia like wo. CRIKEY.
That is the best quote ever. Ever ever ever. It is from Witch Baby in Francesca Lia Block's Witch Baby. She is so wild and viscious and awesome. I didn't write yesterday, and dammit, I forgot my skirt at mom's so i could wear "THE HIGH HEELS" dum dum dum I'll find suttin tonight. WHoooie. Long last coupla no school days. 1/2 tm, the last. Bored, tho i gtg. i love witch baby, she is neat. Have fun wishin this was longer.
This song is so awesomeish. Yeah. Today I had 2 finals, then went with Brian to the mall...it was rad. Gnarly. Tubular, yeah! We sat around on this hollow* bench outside fer like ever and I was seeing airplanes that supposedly were'nt there but omg I swear to god they were!! And we kept walking past that LOTR Orlando Bloom cardboard cutout guy and omg it kept reminding me of Roiben cuz of mostly just his long hair, even though Roiben isn't blonde. BRIAN BOUGHT ME THAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG OMG OMG I Have to pay him back for it, I dont care what he says. OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG it is my BIBLE. I like green tea now. Brb. Hi sorry. That took like, ferever and a day to help out dad with the truck and dinner and stuff. Anywho...erm... I'll come back later. Too bizzy. Later.
I want a knight.
This song gets randomly stuck in my head these days. It used to make me think of Jess and her Steve, but now it makes me think of Mike. Mike, Mike, Mike. And at the resteraunt, I finished TITHE. HOLY CRAP . The very last page, while reading it, the HUGEST GRIN spread across my face and I couldn't get it off. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. I mean, WOW. This whole KNIGHTS-ARE-MY-LASTEST-INFATUATION thing is like, the best. You have NO IDEA. I am in love. I want this book to go on and on and screw Kaye, I want it to be all about Roiben. At first I hated Roiben and like LOVED Naphamael, but now it's completely backwards. Well, Naphamael's hotter, still, no matter what, with his skin all burned from the iron eyebrow ring. :-D :-D and the cloak of thorns, wo. But still, I love Roiben to Death now. I want him. I wish I could make him so very very very very very very very very real. Hehehe. I really really love Roiben. I bet I will dream about him and everything. Ew, the Ironsiders called him ROBIN. haha, it takes way too much away from him. He is so very elegant. So loyal, so...commandable. Wow. I am so head over heels for a character in a book. Hahaha. Oh well, it's fun to be in love. I can't get my heart broken this way, can I? I don't believe in brokenness, so I guess not. I very much believe in Roiben. Wo. Wo wo wo. :-D I am so like, wow. I think I should shut up because this is probably annoying. Tonight at the resteraunt, our waitress reminded me way too much of Kerry. Ick. And um, let's see...I made a grown, perhaps married, man smile. It was so like, cool. My hands are actually starting to hurt, believe it or not. Alrighty, I'll be back soon. Have fun WISHING YOU HAD SOMEONE LIKE MY ROIBEN!! Ciao.
Indie has ^this^ song in her profile. Everytime I look at her profile, it makes me think of Jess and Mike, back in the day, before I even met Mike, like...the night before or something. No, more than that, but still. Matt, my day was FINE. Shut up, boy. Argh. I want to be a knight now. I really do. The only real knight I know is Brian...wo. *Shudder* Dude, no seriously. I wicked want to be a night. Roiben (I almost used his full name *grimace*) has completely changed me. You guys HAVE to read this book. It is better than Sweetblood, which, I have to get back from the Tougster. I can actually sit and type for maybe 5, 10 more minutes, but I think I would like to go finish up Tithe. JC, I am in love with Roiben. That's weird, cuz I DESPISED him at first. He's my ideal character though...like, not like my dream guy, but I see like every character I've ever created in him. It's awesome. I think thats the best I can explain it. I am not worrying about capitals or anything from this point forward because my pinky hurts and id rather not keep it that way. Ok, here I go....adios.
It's suddenly wicked hot in this room. (It's cause I walked in)...heh, today yo no va a la escuela until son las diez porque los examenes. Es fantastica! Then I took one exam, history, and left, tryin to find a ride home. I just got Cook to come and get me and Egypt came over and we chilled and like, sat around tryin to make her site. All the while we were talking to Brian online and LUCIEN FROM BD!!!!!!!! (AYE, we told him we were groupies n he was like "sry cant talk to no groupies" ahahaha) anyway, WOW. Okay, so Brian. I have slowly been realizing that I really like him again, like I used to, but we're good friends. Well, we were. I dont know, things change, all cuza last halloween. :-/ I still feel like crap about that. I miss just chillin with him after school and stuff. Those were the good old days...catchin hispanic frogs named enrique and juan carlos and steven. Yep, miss it. And sittin around watching 7th Heaven and Mary Kate and Ashley reruns...hahahahahaha (NOT). But yep, really miss it. I don't know. I talked to Sam yesterday. Everyone I really like is like, not there. They all have someone else or don't want anything now, and I don't either really, but like, blah. I like having someone there who CARES, ya kno? Sam said how she doesn't wanna be with anyone because being single rocks and u can kiss anyone u want well yah...but thats not all true. I mean, I couldnt kiss her when I wanted to and I was single...etc. I couldn't kiss Maureen, cuz of TOM. All of that. I think I have to finish later, we are taking Cookie to dindin fer grad. partay! Not that I am excited or anything... Don't feel like oochiein' or wallyin', sry. If yer readin this, plz comment, I could use a little lovin'. (The regular kind.) Perv. TITHE is awesome. Roiben makes me think of Brian. (Wo.) I just realized how much I bet Roiben is my fav. character in the book...maybe even over Corny and Gristle. Wanna chill all week after exams. Let me know. If you care. Blech. Over and out.

NOBODY WANTS TO BE LONELY NOBODY WANTS TO CRY MY BODY'S LONGING TO HOLD YOU SO BAD IT HURTS INSIDE!! TIME IS PRECIOUS AND IT'S SLIPPING AWAY AND I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU ALL OF MY LIFE NOBODY WANTS TO BE LONELY, SO WHY, WHY, WHY WON'T YOU LET ME LOVE YOU? Last night, EL carnival, long story...took a long time to get there, had to go to nic's little kids clubhouse place and listen to "hickory dickory dock" over and over and over and over and stare at pictures of angelina jolie (WOOOOOOW) fer an hour before we were off to greg's uncles fer directions and we still got wicked lost on the way to the carnival but ok to make a long story short here's the summary of what happened las night thru to this mornin as told to Matt like 2 seconds ago: i went to the el carnival that everyone was at and i was loopy on this prozac n like all my worst enemies were there so me and greg and maureen and this kid derek who maureen is like in love with who is like one of my new best friends despite the fact that he has the same name as my backpack, we left and drove around, ended up at chill spot where i freaked out cuz i was so fuckin jealous of maureen n this kid so everyone flipped n drama drama drama n then we had to SPEED Like all hell back to the carnival to get maureen back to get picked up thurr and then we hung out in the car n talked till i had to be home n i got home n said goodnight to amy and shes like "megan" and i turned around n shes like "you smoked" n i was like "ya" n started bawlin but we talked and talked about it n it was ok and then my dad came home and i told him, i wouldnt let him hear it from anyone else n he was real cool with it and glad it made me wanna puke n then this morning i callededed my mom at work n told her n she actually didnt flip she was glad i was honest n told her and stuff which was my intention and they all just said its ultimately my desicion but please dont smoke its bad u will die the end there's a lot more to it than that, but so what. it was my night, not yers. So thurr! Okies, well I now come to learn that Maureen and Derek are dating and I just want to cry. I like them both, I love Maureen to death, I shoulda just took her when I coulda, before she moved on from CaliBoys to Ravers. "because no one mopes for days in heaven, do they?"
I am listening to this slow song on the FINCH cd, I'm not sure what it's called, but its pretty and slow and its the kind of music I want Ironside to be so bad. Did I write yesterday? Oh yeah, but it got deleted...gr....ok. So here's what's up...I went to this new psychiatrist in the am yesterday and she's cool tho her boobs were like hanging out but whatever she put me on Prozac now, and I just took my 1st pill, so I'm wondering how tonight will go. Tonight I am going to the EL Carnival with Greg and Derek and the cool Derek (hehe) and we're gonna meet up with Mistress. Um, hmm..o ya I remember. Um, ok I remember the el carnival 2 summers ago, the summer of Kerry (last summer I worked at the cape all summer) and I went with Kerry and this kid Pat Boss who I have the best story about. Anyway, I could tell you what I was wearing that night cuz I remember it so much. Pat Boss, one of those one hit wonder kinda boys, ya meet em, ya crush, ya hook up, ya flirt A LOT, ya wanna go out but u have no idea if you could consider it a relationship. Aka, SUMMA LUVIN!! But yeah. Pat's sn was BOSS404. That's where my obsession with the number 404 started way back in the day. It didnt mean anything then, but things change, ya know? I got to go eat lunch, be back.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I JUST LOST ANOTHER FUCKING NOVEL WORTH OF JOURNAL! OMG!! IT WAS SO LONG, AND IT WAS AN IMPORTANT ONE TOO! This is why she put me on Prozac.
I am listening to the Rascal Flatts MELT cd and it is SOO good! I have been listening to this and Chris Cagle soo much ("cuz the chicks dig it") aye aye aye! Ok so after I finished writing in here yesterday, Mistress and I walked and we ended up that Blue Moon coffee roasters and Stephanie was thurr with (her mom?) HAHA ITS TUESAY! Anyway, Mistress got this Raspberry Italian Soda and it was mad good and then we tried to play chackers with the big huge chess pieces on the big chess table but didnt realize that you could only put your pieces on the black squares and you could only move diagonally. Hahaha. Then we found a regular size checkers so it was ok and we playsed and i was like kinged 9 times on one guy n she was gettin mad but she had all my guys n i had only jumped like one of hers hahaha and i stacked em so high that when i needed a knew one i took the chess knight (;-)) hahahaha. It was fun. *BOYS ON BIKES* hahahahahaha and then we walked back and blick and then we were at moms n we hung out in my room listening to Rotten Fun and Echo Echo Echo Echo Echo Echo Echo and then her mom came and picked her up and then I did all my usual unsort and resort my binder type cumpulsions until greg called and saved me and i felt like rambling so i described in excruciating detail like every last item in my room hahahaha. It was fun. but then we talked for real, about this CD we're making, about like personal shit, all kinds of things, whatever, ya know. Then I almost fell asleep so we got off the phone and then I was gonna call matt but it wasn't all that late. I haven't heard or seen from him...i told him about the flameling, right?? I think so...but not the other? O hell, I dont know. WOULD SOMEONE JUST START COMMENTING FOR REAL ON MY STUPID JOURNAL!? I sit here and type this all out fer my fans and i want some luvin back guys, come on. Why should I have to do all the work?? LOL. Rascal Flatts are good. Ok so Mom just got all pissy cuz i couldnt wake up at 6m like thats anything new *rolls eyes* aye aye aye. I miss school already. Yesterday was a blast though. It truly was. I want every day of my summer to be like that. I have to make plans today for tomorrow and thursday and everything. This morning I have to go get an evaluation from my psychiatrist. Some new lady or something...I hope that I don't start bawling. I'm sick of happy pills. I am. Aye, I wanna be normal again!!!! (I never thought I'd say that...) but really. I don't know. I guess the summer will help, it better. IT BETTER!! IT really BETTER! Otherwise, arrrgh. Nah, it will. Hanging out with Greg and Mistress and Derek now too I guess, it will be fun. They're like my bestest friends ever. Even more than Matt and Dove and Indie now because I don't see them as much and now they don't go to the mall anymore because Indie got kicked out or whatever...so BLAH. SO yeah, Derek and Mistress are like the new vinny and tasia of that little group i LOVED But i am warning both of them right now if they sit in the back and make out to the point of almost screwing i will go find that guy that had that chainsaw and steal it. AYE. Mistress, ehh, you know what I said about it yesterday. I meant that. Yeah apparently Derek was like freaking out that Mistrss liked him or thought he was cute or whatever. He is so getting the there-is-no-way-in-hell-you-are-hurtin-my-baby-or-i-really-truly-will-get-that-chainsaw talk from me next time i see him. He wants greg to give me his number so i can give it to her, and vice versa. Haha, what if we don't? HAHAHA. It's weird that one of my new best friends has the same name as my backpack. That will get weird. Esp. pppl that know us they will be like "why does ur backpack say DEREK on it?" o wait...THEY ALREADY DO THAT!! HAHA. Anyways, yeah. I found all my old rough drafts of Is It Raining in California? and it made me miss Ant a lot but oh well, right? Wait till we actually make the stupid song (if) and then let him hear it. HAHAH. Dad's in the shower, and I'm willing to bet when he gets out he'll wanna talk about something or other, and then I'm gonna have to pull a superman and like change wicked fast and then go. Aye am I gonna miss Derek today. (THE BACKBACK, GUYS. shush) Eh, whatever, I guess. I hope this appt. isn't like blech. Like, I hope she's just like are you sad? Okay cool bye. Not like Have you done this in the last 13.6 hours and have you done this at all ever and was it good? Haha, nah, But I hope its not like dad is sitting there either. I don't think so, cuz Dr.K asked him to leave, but whatever. Its not talk therapy, so that's good, I don't like talking about my feelings unless I am trying to save someone else or something like that. Yeah.....blah. It's 8:21, my appt. is at 9, but ya know how Dad is. (or do you?) Aye...I better get going now. I hope you are all happy that I am writing regular size entries again. YOU'RE WELCOME!!! (to leave a comment) mwahaha. :-D :-D Lata Gata.
Today was so gnarly!! Ok I wokeded up and went to the padres and then went upstairs n realized i had no bra hahaha and then i found one n i was happy n then i went downstairs to go sit outside and read n get all tan and sexy and whatnot and then like as I was walkin out dad was all like raaarrrr you need to stop being depressed and crying all the time!! and I'm like what? Dad, im in a good mood. and hes like cummere were gonna talk and so i sat in the office chair and he sat in the big black one and amy was on the phone in the fuckin room where we were tryin to talk (grr) and the babe's in the background like wailing and no one would help him so i bury my head in my knees and dad gets all mad like roar LOOK AT ME AND STOP CRYING im like dad!! LOOK AT ME !! I AM NOT CRYING! I AM TRYING TO BE IN A GOOD MOOD!!! aye aye aye. Urm so anywho he leaves fer ding dongin and i go on the computer n start werkin on the site and talking to *this person who i am not supposed to have talked to apparently and we had a convo about the flameling and the smokeling that have come to haunt me because of what I did...speaking of, ok I havent yet explained this. A flameling is an extremely strong spirit that dances and dances, basking in the victims shame. It is extrememly hard to summon a flameling, even by accident. But it was so beautiful and hypnotizing as it danced and danced in my driveway and i couldnt shut my window I just watched and watched and as it spun and twirled the sparks that flew from its head twisted and melted into stars and the stars burst and erupted and WOW....wow wow wow. A real flameling. So eloquent. But badness...aye, when a flameling leaves you a smokeling will soon visit you and thats what happened last night. I was in the shower and she was there and she was hissing and viscious and then fierce and her little fangs glittered in the little bit of light. But I was so scared. THANK GODDESS smokelings cant come near water because it was terrifying!!!! OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG Finally I got her into that crystal and now its freezing cold because of her and I couldnt look in the mirror at all!! I caught a glimpse of myself in the glass of the window and it wasn't me...it was her!!! It was so bad. I tried calling Matt over and over because of the whole Flameling/Smokeling ~ demon thing. I wanted to know if there was anything ever (liek a weird energy or something) between him and demon ever, b/c there has to be a reason I call him Flameling before I even saw this one. I am really scared. Ok so anyway on to the regular stuff. Greg came and got me at dads and we went ova and got Derek in ludlow and then we went to the mall for all of 5 min to get Greg some adapter-y thingy. Then we drove and drove and Derek smoked and smoked and Greg smoked a clove *bows* and he blew all the smoke in my face *EW* and then we went to mcdonalds and got like a bazillion different things and we stopped in a "chill spot" on the side of the highway and Steve was there hahahahaha in his car, eatin mcdonalds too!!! AHAHAHA! And then we just kinda chilled and me and greg talked and then they all went to set up greg's shit in the back so he could spin records, it was hot, random, but hot. And then like I smoked and it was gross but whatever, I kinda needed to get it out of my system. Blech. But ok then we called Mistress and went and got her (even tho we got lost haha) and we saw dads truck n i was hidin n then we got dropped off and mom as like "ew *mistress* do u smoke" n we''re like...umm....derrrrek (WHO MISTRESS IS LIKE OBESSESSING OVER! AyE!) he's kind cute but hes 14 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHA that is the funniest ever.! Anyways I'm gonna go cuz she is still here and I betcha I am pissing her off. Oopsies. I luv ya anywho...CRiKEY! Over n out
http://www.freewebs.com/thissictransition/HeavenOnEarth.htm Look at that. Please. (I hope you see this, Mistress. Or is that smokeling ~ demon in yer way again?
My feelings are all out of whack right now. Really all...screwed up and twisted and tangled. Greg left fer NY tonight, but we hung out fer a bit at the mall and talked and yep. Then they left (greg derek paul) and i hung out with this girl Kelsey who i dont really know but whatever because shes pretty and shes wicked cool and she gets me and thats gnarly. But then guess who i see.....................................loverboy. i kno its him because he is with gremlin and i kno what gremlin looks like without a doubt so i knew it was him so i went over n whutever, but like all night he barely looked at me, barely said a word to me, always just walked away from wherever i was.........and so inside (WWAAYY deep inside) i was sooo crushed but i didnt let it show too much, didnt let it bring me down because i figured i was just overreacting and being stupid and expecting more or something, i dont know. it just ate away at me inside...it felt like crap. and then Mistress was high n like ehhhh and it seemed like she was avoiding me really bad because she didnt say a word to me and didnt look me in the eye or anything, i dont know. i wgot home, Jesus brought me home, i was playin wit baby jesus in the back and she is so cool!! i luv her!! n jesus was like ima come in n meet yer parents so he came in and just talkedededed ferever and whatever then he left to walk home and mom asked me what was that kid smoking? hahaha. And then i ate some poptarts, the goooood kind, and then went online and talked to Mistress and she said she only didnt talk to me and stuff was because se thought i didnt wanna talk to her cuz he was high, which is true, but i was supposed to sleep over her house tonight and i was going to ask her out so there i go being REALLY crushed. egypt was there and creepy kid and amber and egypt and thats all the important people that i havent mentioned yet i think. HOLY MOTHER i am moving next week guys! ew, not going to think about it. cookie's pist i was writing on his shirts hahahah so my I LOVE BUNNIES one he Xed out the LOVE and wrote hate and then after he wrote AND THEIR MAMAS hahahahaha i was like cook, do u not get that that just makes the shirt that much better? haha. so anyway, my feelings are all out of whack for them peoples, and i dont know about loverboy...gotta talk to him...i wanna be with Mistress so bad. I think. I DONT EVEN KNOW ANYMORE!!!! rraarr rraarr rraarr. I just need to know what people are feeling about me at this point, so i can stop thinking this way. I'm just sitting here, AGAIN, spinning in this dumb black chair, waiting. AND MA IS PLAYING TONY HAWK UNDERGROUND.
Omg I cannot even begin to explain movie marathon with my Mistress, wo. Omg, like...wow. 12 hours, 9am to 9pm...7 movies...ok ready here they go ghost ship "when we get outta here, i'm gonna buy you a bathtub." 16 candles "who's he?" "that's me" "who are you?" "i'm him." "oh. okay." orange county "Put that out man...put that out." say anything... "Never never never never never NO!." multiplicity "Did you bring me a monkey?" idle hands "They were killed by ants?" the princess bride "stop rhyming and i mean it" "does anyone want a peanut?" That took like forever diet cokes cuz wo. Heh, it was soo much fun though. Whhhee. Great great great night. Anyway, Greg is going away to NY tonight for 1NATION (aye wanna go) and stayin thru the weekend maybe all next week and that sucks because i luuuv chillin with him he is my best friend, eh. I attempted to write another song *this morning while Mistress was watching Idle Hands cuz ive seen it tooo many billion times. Heh, "I'm not going through all that Tanya." Haha. I could quote those movies alllll day. "Hi doug hi doug hi doug hi steve" "c ya steve" "that leg's gonna have to come off steve" hahahaha. "she touched my pepe steve." ahahaha Multiplicity is great. I don't wanna go on, I'll make myself sick, not that I'm not already about to puke up a million diet cokes. if you put "i dont think so", would you? "n do it with the most perfect guy in a nice pink trans am." "a black one." "a black guy?" "no, a black transam. a pink guy."
I am like out of it. I passed out on my floor face down in the middle of my room ha.ha.ha. Greg woke me up when he called...I dont think I could fall back asleep now if I tried. I mean...ehh it's annoying trying to fall asleep. But yeah, I'm like in a daze, I have no idea what I am doinf right now. Maureen is home from Brians or whomevers i dont know i guess and I want to hear from her and she is supposed to give me a call like NOW but I guess she forgot or doesn't want to or anything. I don't wanna like seem pushy or whatever the fuck that is, I just want it to go back to the way it was befffoooooore Derek. Speaking of Dereks, I am getting a new backpack and his name is going to Actual Dave (haha matt) but yeah...thats how goes it. I am like whhhhaaaa la la la la so I am going to sit and spin in this back black chair like I usually do when I'm just sitting here waiting for that annoying little IM noise and whatnot. Motherfuckers. ps...i love FOAMY!
Hola. *YAWNstretch* Morning. So much to say, so much to say. Where shall I start? Okay...hmm NICK BROWN. Ya know when like something happens with you and one of your friends and you don't talk to them anymore...for whatever reason, you just din't. And you think about em a lot, regret how it's all screwed up, all that. Then like, you wanna call em up or IM them or something to get them back in your life, but you don't know what you would say, and you're scared to make things worse? Yeah...Nick Brown. I IMed him last night and MAN that took a lot of balls. But I just kinda sent him that collage thingy I made, and he responded (im still not sure if it was positively or negatively) but whatever cuz somehow we got back to talking and he still wants to meet and all that happy crap. I don't know, we'll see what happens with things I guess. I'm not letting myself get hurt again. GREG. Heh, last night I was on the phone with him and he was DRUNK OFF HIS ASS and was talking about Nuts! and Kangarooy stuff and how do kangaroos fuck and Nuts! Nuts in a bag! Would you like Nuts with that? Hahahah. You kinda had to be there. Anyway, as funny as it was, I was actually really scared cuz he kept wanting to leave to go pick up paul and junk and I was like NOOOO FUCKING WAY believe it er not Greg there are ppl who CARE about you and dont wanna c nuthin happen and im not bein stupid about this i love you man yer my best friend in the world. And I would not get off the phone, I had to keep him there, home, because I could not have forgiven him if he had driven drunk, whether something happened to him or not. Yeah its like 9 am and i am exhausted now and looking forward to a day on the ice cream truck, but whatever. Cuz there is nothing I can do and my best friend is safe and that means a helllll of a lot more to me than sleep. I'm gonna get goin, shower, stretch, all them push ups n crunches n junk that I do now, EAT to prove im not anorexic, call and see how greg is, attempt to make last nights failed plans for tonight, and then sit and wait for the ugly little ding dong cart to pull back up to the house. Eh, I could use the sugaryyyyyyy ice cream today. Sugar is the coolest pickmeup, esp. when yer all in a daze cuz so much just suddenly happened n ya yer happy and stuff but just like....WWWOOOOO. You know what I mean. You do. But anywhoooo, here I go, shutting up. Don't miss me too much. Ehh, that's my job.
I have failed yet again. Fucking babies CRY. Amy made it a point to just LET THE FUCKING BABY CRY SOMETIMES! He's been in the other room...crying. Amy was in the living room, LET HIM CRY LET HIM CRY but no...next thing I hear MEGAN!! DON'T YOU HEAR HIM CRYING IN HERE?? WHEN HE'S IN HERE WAILING FOR 10 MINUTES YOU CAN COME CHECK AND SEE WHAT'S WRONG!! just let him cry just let him cry I say. No eye contact. Bad sign, she's pist. Good sign, I can hold back tears. I wanna run away upstairs and get lost in my somehow now hypnotizing walls, or get lost on Syranus with all the Tearstain people, but NO. NOW she's in the living room, (guess she wasn't before) and there is no way in hell I am walking through there. No, not fucking pride.......it's weakness. I wish Mistress were here. Anyone. I want to be a good angel again. I want to go back to being all happy and graceful (pfff) and wise. Now I have these scratches on my face and now on my heart too...is that what those pains are?? Here I go, writing and writing away all my fear, sadness, pain, whatever. Hiding behind these words, this wall of ramblings-on that I am building that no one is reading anyway. Everything is smelling of cigarettes today and its gross. Maybe its in some of my close frum hanging out with the boys and stuff. Ehhhhhhhh I don't know. I quit tho hehe. I haven't smoked since carnival night. (Dont even remember when that was.) I wanna go hide in my room!! It's so safe in there. It's so....serene in that Megan kind of way. Heh, that's kinda like an oxymoron. Eh, maybe not. I am going to post this now and see if I can do something else and keep my insecurites from driving me crazy like they usually do. The phone is ringing. Oh man, what happens if I don't answer it, hmmm???
Mistress. Tables turn when you don't even realize it. Or is it the world? I don't know anymore...I'm going to try to stop feeling it. But she broke up with Derek and I am in utter shock. I was really looking forward to her sleeping over tonight but she's at 6flags with this Tricia that she goes everywhere with now. Ehh, I don't know. I'm being stupid again, like the Brenda thing. Sorry I haven't written in a while. Internet's been down, AHH i know. I have become a re-born tv junky and it sucks but oh well. I stayed home all day staring at my walls and singing at the top of my lungs "break yer heart" by bnl. Good fucking song. Word. Ummmmm hmm what to say? So much. O yes, latest infatuation: MARY-KATE OLSEN. Hahahaha me, I know. Cuz um, yeah. She's anorexic, but she's pretty. I don't know. That has nothing to do with it. Something about her.....aye. I drew a picture of her, its okkkkay but whatever. I have this big scratch down my forehead (RIGHT IN THE CENTER!!!) from nic and it kiiiilllls like a bitch omg omg. Vinny is on the phone talking about Tasia, how he'll never be with her again. This is a boring random entry, I am distracted. I need to really catch up though. I read Matt all of TEARSTAIN BETWEEN over the phone today and my oh my do I miss that cast, aye. Shadow and Devlin and Sapphire (*shudder*) and Wolf and Elfie/Crimson and the whole gang. I am going to attempt to rewrite it, and that will be very intersting indeed. In the first part, well, the story as it is now, I held back a lot...ya know, with like the sex scenes (haha matt) and all that stuff and the language and the little things I guess. But it's a good, well developed plot for once, so I'll work from there. I made a really cool collage from scraps of Nick Brown *cringe*'s pictures and poems and journals and things and it looks pretty good actually. I like it. But thats me and I am weird. I hope I can talk to Maureen soon. And Derek...Bananas are weird--in or out of their pajamas.
That's a quote from a John Mayer song called "Love Song For No One." I love someone. I feel so fucking pathetic for it too, because I can't seem to do things right, can't seem to please her anymore. Her spiteful words break my heart in a million trillion pieces. . .and she's not really even being mean to me or upset. I'm pretty glad for that, I think. Grateful, I mean. I don't know. I hope she sees this and understands how I feel, because yeah, she's with someone else and I am stupid for trying to get in the way, but there's feelings inside me so strong that they just kind of take me over. Things were going fine, now all this with her, failing her...and this all with Greg...everything. It's getting all knotted up again, but whatever. I'm gonna fix it this time. I don't know how...but I have a list of things to do this summer, it's pretty long and outrageous, but oh well because I am actually getting through it already and the summer just like started. I have about 40 minutes to type, and I am hoping I can keep my concentration on this so strongly, on rambling, so that I can keep my mind off of her. I don't know what kept me from being with her, from asking her out. I don't, I don't, I DON'T! And I hate it...I really hate it. No, I regret it, it's sad. I can't stop thinking about her, even with haterboy there, even with creepy kid there, even with matt there, even with Dove there, even with Greg there, even with TJ there, all of them. It's her I know I should be with. Her I know that I can't live without. I don't know. Maybe I didn't see it before because she was just so right there and I didn't know how bad it felt to know that I could have had her and didn't take it. I got off track....um hold on, Oh yeah, so one of the things on my list is to save HER. I wish I could. I have failed her though. Oh my God, Mistress. I'm tearing myself apart inside without you. Demons are pretty too though.
Hahaha. Like I have a "man". Pffff that. Sorry guys, I only came back because I realized while I was in the shower that I said I had good news but I never said what it was. Oh well, sucks for you because I don't feel like typing it. It's about Ironside, so you can use yer imagination (fer those of u that have one) heh. Meow. I wish I could Meow. Meow. Meow. Nah...Oliver is the coolest little dude ever. You know it. When was it that I started this journal? In May? Okay Okay...so that was after Oliver was born. So that whole escapade isn't logged in here really. And yes yes, MY was it an escapade. Heheheh. I wanna hear Kerrin* sing. Indie too. All of them really....Speaking of...I'm supposed to call Creepy Kid today...I'll have to find time and not ferget cuz I feel bad that I've been like, I don't know, not there. Stand-offish. Whatever. Steve, man, if yer reading this...I'm sorry!...I've been caught up in all this crazy shit going on ayeeyeeye. SPRINGLISH TIME! Word. Ok so like Danielle is at escuela de summer n im like, yo, that biatch is crazy bangin'. She is off the chain! WoRd Of MuThA, yO. *giggle* Es muy bonita. Aye...Whenever I see huur right thurr im all -yo, mamacita, HOLLA ATCHURR BOYZ. uhHuh. Word. I rizzle lizzle hizzle a lot but that dun mizzle. So wuteva. I'm out. This joint is crazy whack...- hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. That's great. I don't really have anything else to say, I am just rambling. Blllllaah. I wicked hope Mistress comes over but I bet she's sleeping. She better get this telapathic message I am sending her because I want her to wake up so I can get a hold of her so she can come over. Blech. I wanna finish this Ovando story. Writing it, I mean. I gotta get going. Haha. This has been your not-so-regularly-scheduled program. Hehe. Alright well over n out.

That kinda sucks though, because I have nothing to say. Question: is tj gonnn be my summa lovin? answer: pfff how should I know?

But I won't abandon it completely, I don't know. What should I do? Aye........um.....anywho i have been spendin as many waking hours as i can with greg n derek's always been there and its been a while since the night of the carnival when Mistress was with us, but whatever. I wanted to see her today, I finished my skirt and it is soooooo awwweeeesooommmmmeee! There is a new chill spot, and actually it is fucking amazing!!!!!!!!! They're gonna try n get it frum the state cuz its like this whack little beach with a beachhouse n a little house and junk thats all abandoned...it's AWESOME holy crap. So hopefully they'll get that.....we got permission from the cops to thro a party thurr today, tho i had to get home before that, but whatever. Mistress is now apparently at the movies, but I thought she couldn't go out!!! I dont know why she would to the movies with sammie when she could go party with HER BOYFRIEND. I wanna make this summer like a me-n-kerry-*cringe*-attached-at-the-hip kinda summer with her. I wanna be with her and greg and der every second i can, n not let them make out in the back!!! AYE AYE AYE!!! Best langueage ever. SPRINGLISH. Because english, spanish, spanglish, or slang can't decribe it. It's too whiteboyish now too. Aye love it. Listenin to Atmosphere cuz he is radical. Gotta c whats up with tomorrow.... Mistress, If you are reading this, I want to spend as much time with you as possible this summer.....I love you more than you will ever know. Gonna go bum rush. Keep on keepin on.
I can't talk, I just have something extrememly important that I've been meaning to write in here. NEW BREAKING BENJAMIN SONG!!!!!!!!!!! Best news ever! It's about time...I knew there was a reason I loved them so much. Okay, enjoy. Turn me over.
YESTERDAY WAS SOOO FUCKING AWESOME!!!!! OMG, I went to Sam's bday party and it was the funnest ever! It sux that Matt and Jess didn't go, but there were like a bazillion people there coming and going. It was like, Sam, Indie, Mike C, Mike H, Mike F, Krystil, DJ, Sarah, This girl Jessica* who I don't know and some girl that looked like her that I don't know, Creepy Kid, this kid Josh, this kid Chris, Stephanie, Nicki, Tougie, Jay, ROB, um. . .um. . .o well I have a feelin I forgot some ppl. Add me and the puppy (pudge) who I want!! Yep. It was fucking KICK ASS!! Only, the whole time I realized that I really like Sam, like, a lot more than I really thought I did, and it was driving me insane the whole time, and then Indie was there telling me how she feels about me and everything and I kinda still like her but not so much I dont know I never talk to her anymore or anything. Anyway, we all just hung out ferever n it was kick ass and we listened to BD and everyone who knew it was singing and everyone who didnt was like hey this music is good yeah! N then pizza n then cake which they all ran around smushing in each others faces. It was hot. After a while we walked to Indies and then walked to "the Dingo" i guess but it was cool. we went thru the woods n its like these traintracks buh theyre all up high n n stuff it was so awesome up there but then we were all, let's leave, misquitos eating us alive!!! So we headed back and when we were walking were like PLEASE START POURING PLEASE START POURING and it did and we played in the rain and danced in the rain and walked in the rain and jumped in the puddles and Jush even swam in one cuz they were so huge, I mean, we all got DRENCHED but it was like one of the best things that has happened in a while to me. Really, it was like, WOW. Seriously. I can't even shut up about it. So we walked back, drenched, like a mob of us, Mike (f) and Krystil left somewhere along the way, and then we went back to Sam's but everyone just went around back and ran around in all the mud and chased each other with the hose n im like c'mon MUD WRESTLING haha but then Me n Indie n Creepy Kid n Rob go to Indie's real fast to change into her dry clothes n we played dress up haha and I have Indie's clothes on n they are so comfy!! (haha im in Indie's pants!) and then Indie/Rob carried me back to Sam's cuz I had no shoes (they were all wet) and then we said bye to everyone and group hugged everyone and i was on robs back so it was Nuts! an then we got in Rob's car and Sam came out looking like....WOW. HOLY CRAP. I was STUNNED. She came over to say goodbye *and she kissed me*!! Then Rob drove me home n we chitchatted about school and college and senior pranks like we always do when he drives me home but its awesome because he knows what he's talking about and no one ever wants to talk about that stuff really. So thats nice. Then he came n met my mom and stuff then I went in, changed, did laundry, then watched some dumb reality sho (for love or money) cuz Lou had it on the tv and it was the last episode, and let me tell you...it took 2 hours of them going IM SO NERVOUS IM SO NERVOUS before they gave it away in the last 5 minutes. I'm not exaggerating either. It was pathetic. Then I packed the rest of my stuff, went down, watched Family Guy, then fell asleep before sealab and all that good stuff. But oh well. Then this morning I came over here to Dads and went upstairs and went to sleep. Woke up, there are like a million cars here, nannies n cookies n jackies, but i have no idea where anyone is. The end. Haha. PS- Matt you fucking loser why didn't you come yesterday!?!!? It was SOOO GNARLY! n HAHA I finally figured out who deserves* that one thing u want SOOO badly. Hehe. Dont kill me. Adios...if no one shows up I'll be back sooooooon. But fer now I'm done. Turn me over.
Heh. Okay, here goes. Did I write yesterday? I don't think so, but I don't remember. Yesterday everyone here left at like 4:30ish and didn't do the password on the computer but I refused to go to the fireworks andyway cuz I could watch em out the window from the kids next door do em crazy nuts, and as it turns out Fitzy was there so heh, go me. I win. Anyway, yeah...so I sat down and plaed Tony Hawk Underground for like hours and jc that game is whhhhhack compared to the others, but whatever. I dont really care. Then I got bored, and watched like Degrassi and My-So Called Life (during which I cried for Rainy because HOLY SHIT....nevermind, gotta c it) and the like Last Comic Standing and a bunch of music videos and then more Degrassi I think, I can't remember. And then finally Night Swim came on and I watched a shitload of Sealab 2021...that show is Nuts!! HAHAHA! And Aqua Teen Hunger Force didn't come on any of the time I was away, nor did Home Movies...those are THE GREATEST SHOWS EVER but oh well. Then finally the fam got home at MIDNIGHT so then...oh no wait, they came home at midnight DURIN Sealab 2021...ooooh yeah cuz I watched Futurama and it was like....MY LIFE STORY! I'm not kidding, holy CRAP! I'm so corny, but it was a goooood episode. SHUT UP MATT I know what you are thinking, and I cant help that I have become a bad tv junky again, what do you expect? Ok so theeeennnnn today I went to the EL parade and was bored so I wrote a song and just sat around, then I went on the truck with dad but later than i was supposed to because the parade toook madd long cuz they had to stop it for like a half hour at least cuz some lady like randomly passed out in the street from the heat or something, i dont know, and they made a big scene, but yeah. Then I got home and packed a lot because everything has to be packed by tomorrow and that is scary but this house is just like glowing the STEVE's energy still and it makes me sick to think about. But yeah, then Greg got me and me him and derek and paul went to dereks fer his big bad 15th birthday party (hah) and we went there and candles cake blow (haha) and yeah. They all called me anorexic even tho i dont eat cake!! AHH I only bake it (HAHAH HAHAH AHA HA HAHHAHAH HAHAHA HAHAHAH AHA HAA HA HA HA HHHA AHHA AHHHHHA AHAHHA HAA HAAHAHAHAHAHA AHAHA HA AHAHA AHA AHAH AHA AHAHA O MAN I CRACK MYSELF UP AHAHAH AH AHA HA HHHA AHHHA AHAHAHAHAH AHAHAHA AHAH AHAH AHAHAH AHAHAH AHA AHH A WHOOOOO HAHAHAH AHA HA HA HA HA HA O BOY HAH HAHAAHA ok im done). Anyway. yeah, then we went to Gregs and left derek at his house with his fam all mad at us (hahahah) and then yeah we went to gregs and fell asleep and wok eup 4 or 5 hours later at like 9 haha it was funny. Then I cam home and now I am here the end. Adios. Thank you, come again. With a present for me next time...
My teeth hurt, don't know why. Period cramps like wo and it SUCKS like a mother. *Shudder*. Um, OMG guys I am leaving for Seattle at 3 am tomorrow morning!! That's like, not long from now. I know its only noon, but that's like 15 hours, gove or take half the day. I wrote out that answer to that one fucking question Matt asks me constantly that I always avoid because it's like the worst question ever. Anyway I typed an answer once into my computer upstairs that has no internet, no printer, and no K key. It was a lonnnng answer, but it was one of the truest things I have ever written. Seriously, it is like wo. But it just sat in the computer for no one to see. But today I wrote it out so I could have it on paper, and eventually I will type it into here and I want responses to it because it means a lot to me. I miss Mistress a lot. I was hoping to see her today but yet again I am stuck at home alone. At least Cookie is here for a little bit I guess, he's gettin Jackie n Pizza n all that fun stuff. I was *painting* last night in the dark during adult swim and accidentally cut straight up into my right index finger on the side and it hurts like a bitch. It bled and bled, so I got a few *paintings* done. Today I split the wound back open and it bled and bled and bled and bled and bled and bled so I painted summore just so the blood didn't go to waste. Loverboy is online and I want to talk to him. Jackie's here. I want some more lemonade. I don't even like lemonade, but I am like addicted to it now like I am to SCRATCH TICKETS and NEOPETS (Matt shut the fuck up I swear to god)... OH GOOD NEWS!! I FOUND MY ATMOSPHERE CDS SO I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THEM LIKE NONSTOP LIKE I USED TO BECAUSE HE IS SO AMAZINGLY GREAT!!! Okay, I'll shut up now. This is keeping me off Neopets but I love those old school wastes of time, so I'll be back. Love and Sex. Adios.
Okay, I know you need this. Here's how it's been... The whole deal with Matt and Steph, well, I don't know. I really don't. Apparently if I hang out with Matt then I am getting in the way of him and Nicci but I have to let Steph spend all this time with him because she likes him and somehow that's okay, that's not getting in the way of Matt and Nicci. I don't know. This is all irrelevant everything because Matt is gay and he knows it. With Loverboy, I am just falling head over heels. Seriously, like, just seeing his s/n signed on makes me smile. I can't help it. So we've been talking. That's good. That's really good. We still barely know each other though, but it's getting there at its own pace and that's the way it should be. That makes me happy. Mom moved to Chicopee. I can't even begin to explain this. There is a barn/shed out back which I call my barn but secretly I really call it the Mud Shed because it is exactly like the Mud Shed that Witch Baby hid in for months, growing. You have to read the book to understand. It calms me down though. I have devolved, too. I have been keeping a glass jar in my backpack with moths and fireflies in it. Well...actually I was able to put them into a plastic cage and keep them outside and the new house, so it's not the same anymore. Yesterday was Meim and Pop's 50th anniversary party! Ben and Lou and I were catching tiny toads that we found. They were seriously smaller than my thumb nail. We had 37. They were sooooo cool. We put them in a huge cardboard box and chilled with them. Then SALLY DARBY was there and we spent the entire afternoon/evening together...talking about things I'm not sure if I care about, school, gangs (haha), being white girls, fashion design (don't ask), etc. On the ice cream truck last night, Dad told me about how like she went psycho and tried to kill herself and had to go through like tons of therapy and all of that this past year and I was like...woah. I think I've been seeing her in the wrong light completely... Mistress...she's been gone camping but for some reason I didn't know that, so I've missed her a lot. Now she's home and that's good but she still loves/misses Karly and has other friends who are actually there and I don't know what to think. For the record, I don't like DEREK SANTOS like that. Um, what else... This thing with Greg I will explain at the end of this entry...I'll put this convo him and I are having now...it's kind of....scary. I don't know. I *painted* today. For the first time in...a while. Last friday at the mall I hung out with Creepy Kid and Amber and everyone and I became worse addicted to SCRATCH TICKETS and I spent $11 on them and won $8 so really I lost a lot but it was soooo much fun to win! Like wicked natural high, adrenaline rush (like I need it). My new novella...a journal-type story. I am still really working out the major knots, so it'll be awhile before you even see like entry one. Um...hmm...I am leaving FOR SEATTLE on wed. morning at like 6 am so say yer goodbyes! I am not able to take my phone with me so I will miss you all that much more! I'm gonna leave you guys with that much, because there's too much to take it as it is. Here's the thing with me and Greg.

PLUR 2 28 29: ya u want to kno how i honestly feel.... SicTransitHero: yes, i do PLUR 2 28 29: worthless ... i do nothing but make ppl have more problems ... paul told me .. lauren told me ... derek told me .. ur basically tellin me .. my dad told me ....so i am out .. i am getin outa this shit droppin everyone ... and geting out PLUR 2 28 29 signed off at 3:50:58 PM. PLUR 2 28 29 signed on at 3:51:49 PM. PLUR 2 28 29: and ya kno wat the hardest thing about it all is..... tryin to deal with it and make things better but ppl just throw it back in my face and tell me to fuck off SicTransitHero: know what? PLUR 2 28 29: i can;t control shit any more .. i have nothing i am outaa a job now ... my dad is goin to kick me out ... and i don;t want to be here any more PLUR 2 28 29: if all ur goin to do is tell me i am idoit and i need to fix things PLUR 2 28 29: i don;t need u to tell me again i heard it once SicTransitHero: that makes me extremely PIST that you just said that I am basically telling u yer worthless, nothing even close PLUR 2 28 29: i haven;t talked to u in a week i call u and i tell me o i have to go ... call u later .. u never call me back ... .my friend shelly i call she told me she would call me back .. never does ... how would u like it if all ur friends u called said o i got to go i will call u later and they never do PLUR 2 28 29: wouldn;t that make u feel like shit and then have ur best friend tell u that u have problems and u need to fix them and basicallu stop being depressed cause i don;t like it PLUR 2 28 29: how would that make u feel ....... PLUR 2 28 29: worthless PLUR 2 28 29: and i am sry to piss u off that was not my intention of this convo PLUR 2 28 29: but as it seems all i do now is make ppl mad... have ppl get pissed at me and lose my friends SicTransitHero: i am trying to tell you how much u really truly are worth but yer just figting it...you can control it, youre not an idiot, but if you really feel like you cant control things then let medicine or something help u regain control. im not kidding...but it sounds like you dont even want to try to fix things, you dont want to make stuff better and that scares me, that hurts me, and i LOST MY PHONE AGAIN! I MOVED OUT OF MY TOWN!! I AM LEAVING FOR SEATTLE IN LESS THAN 2 DAYS!!!! I AM UNDER SOOOOOO MUCH STRESS ok but i am dealing with it as best i can. that might make me feel worthless but id look beyond self pity and i would find out the reason y they dont call me back because maybe they litterally cant and its not their fault and it hurts them to have me tell them that i feel worthless cuz of something that wasnt their fault! SicTransitHero: so if u want to make someone not pist at you, which is what it sounds like, then FIX IT and i am not going to say it again because im nagging now and thats annoying but i mean it, please think about it. PLUR 2 28 29: i am just goin to leave SicTransitHero: i have been getting death threats ok...im scared about stuff too SicTransitHero: no, please dont SicTransitHero: yer running away PLUR 2 28 29: death threats from who ?

SicTransitHero: ive been trying this entire convo to explain it SicTransitHero: i love you SicTransitHero: yer the best friend i ever had SicTransitHero: and i mean that SicTransitHero: with all myheart SicTransitHero: if this problem doesnt get fixed it will eventually cross some line that will be so bad that...i dont even want to think about it...and then it will be unfixable for real...i dont want to see something happen to you...i couldnt deal with it PLUR 2 28 29: but thats y i go to nyc i can get away from stuff have time to think and we aren't in each pothers way so it won;'t cross that line where some bad will happen ... even time i hang out with u .. yes i love u to as best friend too .. but when i hang out with u more then that comes out .... i feel more ... and i get scared from that because i kno by me haven feelings like then yes something bad will happen soon PLUR 2 28 29: and so when i go to yc i ca get away from i think about u only as friend then and i am not goin to be hurtin inside ...

"I guess..." He was at the mall tonight and I just wanted to go up to him and hug him really really tight and then just knee him square in the nuts. Anyway...this morning I wrote a letter to Joe but got stupid and it's all mushy and SHIT and a half. His name is carved into my chest now by the way...anyway...yeah.

Hey okay I only got a sec because Mistress is in the other room watching the Muppet Show and she wants me to watch it too and I just wanted to say hi and that I am in like the biggest emotional mess and I dont know when I'll be able to explain it but I love her and I don't want to piss her off so I am going to go watch that with her. I know he's not ever ever gonna read this, but Joe...uh. Fuck it, I can't even say it. Nevermind. Dust.
Wowee! Blogger updated itself, so now I can use c o l o r s and different fonts and sizes and bullets and pictures and such!! THIS IS SO EXCITING! Anyway, I am at Dad's now and realized how many typos my last entry had. Haha. Whoops. Anyway I missed a few things about my trip, but I think you get the point. I AM TALKING TO MISTRESS and I miss her so much!! SHE IS COMING OVER!! YIPPEE!! Anywho...yeah. Through my trip I had that journal and I wrote like a million lists in there. Anyway, people who kept me goin through it all: 1.Tim Lake. Don't know why, don't know how. He lives in NY. 2.My Mistress, but that's no surprise. She keeps me going every second of every day. 3.Matt 4.Loverboy. 5.Nick Brown 6.AJC, that's all I'm saying. 7....joe broska.... I'm gonna stop there and breathe for a second. Lately it seems like there are soo many people who I miss so much that aren't there or whatever. AJC, Nick Brown, *TIM LAKE*, Ryan, Joe, et cetera. MISTRESS IS SLEEPING OVER TONIGHT! I miss her soooo much. I want to explain my theory of devolution in here, but its not something I can quite make sense of yet. It's getting there. Guys, omg. I have 356 FEATHERS I collected in Washington! I am going to continue to collect...much more slowly out here of course, and piece together wings like Cherokee Bat did for Witch. Anyway...I am talking to NICK BROWN and I miss him and he says he misses me too and he's glad I had an awesome time and he is jealous of me cuz he did nothing. I want to call Greg, I told him I would every chance I get...but...I listened to my 14 voicemails fisrt (haha) and there was one from him and he was DRUNK and he was DRIVING and calling me and I told him last time he was DRUNK that if he drove ever I would never be able to forgive him. I stayed on the phone with him ALL NIGHT last time because I care about him that much and I couldn't let him leave. He promised me he wouldn't do that and he did. You can't imagine how much that hurts me. not to mention our friendship. Anyway...right before I left he called me upset that I showed Derek that convo that I put a few entries ago because it was between me and him but Derek was worried about Greg like I was and I told him, I AM GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SAVE HIM. I told him straight out that I WOULD SACRIFICE MY FRIENSHIP WITH HIM TO SAVE HIS LIFE. And then look what he goes and does. A part of me says I can't be mad because he lost trust in me for showing Derek, but that's his choice and he broke a promise to me and put his LIFE AT RISK and I think that's a lot worse, don't you? He is calling me now, I am not answering until I am sure what to feel. I get to watch MYSTIC RIVER tonight, yeah! Sorry, I know this is a longish entry and I just typed a long one, but I am making up for a weeks worth of words. Oliver is getting sooo big! I am worried about my party in a couple days because 3 ppl still dont have invites and I cant get a hold of them. :( :( I am really getting stressed about this. And then CRAIG switched my doorknobs so I can't lock my door anymore which means less *painting for megan. But I guess that's alright. I cried my eyes out over it though last night. My privacy is all I have at home. Can't take that away, because then I have nothing left to be there for. I have to teach Mistress to play GOOK because it is such an insane game! SO YOU KNOW, cuz I know you are wondering, GOOK is a card game my extended family created forever ago and is traditionally played at all family gatherings and visits and everything and I kick butt in it now...not as good as BEN, but I'm good. I'm lonely. I miss everybody!! I'm gonna wrap this up for now because I am just rambling and I don't want the important things to be forgotten when you close this window. "It's never goodbye. It's always C ya." -john q.
Guess who's back? Back again. I AM BACK! Washington was AMAZING, you have no idea. I am on Craig's computer and I have like no time to write and I don't havemy notebook on me in wich I wrote every little detail of the trip because it was sooooooo great! Anyway, yeah, later on I willtype all of that yummy stuff in. I think i am going to be forced to go to the fether's tonight which means yet another night without Futurama. Last night I got home just in time to see ATHF and then all those other shows and then Family Guy but I fell asleep right before Futurama...graaaar. Anyway...I miss that stuff, a week without it is a lot...I missed *painting, which I did last night because I needed it. Anyway, I want to see Mistress sooo bad. I talked to her a few nights ago and she is the only one of my firneds I talked to the whole time I was there...I am not kidding you, it was nonstop.

I am Nick Brown's, and I am weary. Dave Attell is ANNOYING. Someone call me...as late as you want. 413-218-8224 Dust.
Last night was very...interesting. Dennis, Mistress' boyfriend...for now. This morning she was talking to him and found out HE HAS A DAUGHTER WITH ANOTHER GIRL that wasn't even his gf at the time or something like that whole Usher deal. Hah! But he should have told her sooner. She said she will break up with him tomorrow. Last night...I....I was lonely, though she was there, because she has Dennis and said I wasn't allowed to kiss her and I wanted to just hold her so bad and after a while I just kissed her. She kissed me back but I'm like, I'm sorry. She's like don't be. Then I did it again and she stopped me and was like "WhY? WHY do you want to kiss me?" And as Matt says, you dont ask questions like that to the Megan. Whatever. So stupid little Megan went downstairs and filled an empty bottle with some of Dad's wine and SHIT IT BURNS but idiotic Megan got herself drunk and prozaced up and such. I don't know. I'm all like....blah. So I talked to Matt and Fitzy on the phone all night and just rambled and I didn't puke!! :-D cuz I wanted to. This morning I haven't eaten really. I tried multiple times. My head hurts and my ears ache and I feel like shit and I'm tired and we watched LOSER which is one of those good movies that put you in one of those moods like...I am going to change something. But the feeling lasts for like 2 seconds. I have been trying to write myself through this but all my words in my head aka thoughts are FUCKEDEDEDED up. I cant think, so yeah... DUST... *pukes*
The smell of brownies is the best.
Mistress is getting here any second, or at least, I thought she was. I guess she's not getting here for another hour now because of dinner. And my Dad made a big deal about how I am sitting down to eat with everything, Miss is no exception, and so now I have to eat. It's like..shit. I talked to Dove today and we talked about what she said in her comment a couple entries ago and yeah she's tiny but I've always seen her eat and she always has energy so it was a shock to me, but now that I am there I understand. You only eat when you NEED to. Like neeeeeed to to function for something or whatever. On a Coke commercial it says "GOT A CRUSH ON MEGAN." yay! I'm lonely. I have been really lonely that like watching a regular movie makes me want to hold the person I'm watching it with, wanna curl up next to them, kiss them, you know the feeling. So anyway, this commercial is getting on my nerves with "I bet your favorite color's black!!" Ugh. Rah, the only music station on this tv is BET so the RapCity ppl need to shut up and play their beloved rap shit. Word. They're talking about GOOD CHARLOTTE and it is creeping me out because they are on RAP CITY ahh. What the heck. He's all "gotta love those rock kids" or sumthin, it was weird and a half. I like this song!! Jadakiss' "Why". I'm gonna go do my profile. I am bored. Dust.
There was one of these a WHILE back, so I'm due. Here ya go: I love you to death : Joe Broska Maureen Begley Nick Brown Matt Haley Greg Abdow Derek Santos Jess Pas Sam Gagen India Wright Katie Foley Anthony j.Crivello Greg Jarry Jake Griffin Egypt Monique Robinson Brian Nasuta and you know it.
I WENT IN THE BATHROOM AND CHOPPED OFF MY HAIR YESTERDAY! Don't kill me...you'll like it. It's all mad crooked and junk but it's me. Fitzy CONGRATULATED me when I told him because I finally just did what I've been wanting to do and I only didn't before because other people wanted me to keep it long and because I wanted it soooo long so I could braid it in a zillion long braids and whip them at people haha. But that's just not me. So I just did it and now it's gonw and whack but nonethelass gnarly and now I will stop complainging about how I want to shave my head. Mistress is probably coming over, but she's at home high off her ass so I don't know. Yesterday I watched: - the virgin suicides : i love cecilia. that movie is so gorgeous, but like lyrical poetry, it has no plot. - life as a house : holy crap holy crap holy crap I WANT SAM SO FUCKING BAD! Too bad I was watchin it with Cookie cuz that movie got me sooooo fuckin horny haha but seriously everything about him is PERFECT and the alyssa's all "Ew. Hah! You're cleaning out the shower now." Omg what I wouldn't give to be naked in a shower with SAM. - dead poet's society : I CRIED...a lot...NEIL OMG I AM SOOOOO SORRY!!! NEIL!!! This movie changed my life . HOLY SHIT. Neil is amazing. Anyway Derek says that Greg didn't drive home that night when he was drunk, so Greg, I'm sorry...but what was I supposed to think?!?! Joe Broska I will love you until the day I die. Dust.
Um...oh yeah, Friday I wasn't on half a bottle of Prozac. I was undermedicated. Last night though, I took extra Prozac and this is going to sound DUMB but I was seeing like dead people all over the place. It didn't help that a total of 8 people died yesterday in all those moviesI watched yesterday but still...I was...ask Matt...I was halloucinating worse than I think I ever have and it was SCARY. Sorry for lying about Friday. I was messed up. I messed up.
This morning I watched the MASTER OF DISGUISE like 3 times in a row and let me tell you...besides that one SHREK impression he does, that movie makes me so sick. Don't ask. ugh. Anyway then we had to bring THE ENTIRE BASEMENT upstairs to the garage and I ate some Corn Flakes (*curtsy*) so I was able to do it, but barely. Last night I was on the phone with Fitzy...(yes, i know)...anyway we were talking about stuff and I admitted to myself and to him out loud for the first time that I have a problem with this whole eating thing...I used the A-word, but I don't know. So last night I took the scale out of the bathroom and weighed myself and I weighed 94 pounds!! That's not only disgusting but it's scary. I don't know what to do. I ate an apple last night, go Megan, I know. Rar. Okay, so Matt and I are developing this plan to, because IRONSIDE didn't work out because I had VERY LITTLE CONTOL over the production of that, that there is something we CAN do. So...we are MAKING A MOVIE! We're not sure just who to cast or what it's going to be about. We're just making sure we have a camera and computers and time and music and all of that that we'll need before we get in too deep. Anyway, if you're interested leave me a comment. I need commitment on this. We can put this together in a week if we really try, so let's just do this. It will be a pretty short movie, which is good. If I have to do like a fun documentary type thing first or a slideshow, whatever, just for practice and such, then I will. I really want to do this, and this is a lot more practical than IRONSIDE was. So yeah...comment, let me know what you think or if you have camera/equiptment or whatever or if to want to be in it or have an idea for a plot or whatever. I don't know. I am so tired. I have been trying to write but I can barely get out of bed. I don't know how I moved all those boxes this morning. I have to go check my email and see if NP figured out about my stolen shit. I'll get back to you all. My neck hurts bad. Dust.
I don't even know what to say right now. Last night I talked to Joe again and that was cool because. . .yeah. . .anyway we talked a lot and he's like ok Bye megan and I'm like bye joe and hes like NO WAIT DON'T HANG UP and I'm like wait...wut? hes like AREN'T YOU FORGETTING SOMETHING. . .? :-D :-D :-D Wo. So yeah. Today was boring. Bouught 40 one subject notebooks. haha. 40. Oh wait, it's like 9:23, supposed to have called Joe 23 minutes ago...I wonder if he's thinking about me. Probably not. I mean, he's at camp HELLO. Anyway yeah...I don't see why he couldn't just call me but I'll call him in a bit and be dumb cuz he probably won't even be able to talk or something with my luck, i don't know. I got in a fight with Greg this morning because of that voicemail I got before and supposedly he wasn't even driving, I don't know. Whatever, i'm too ticked to think. Um let's see...oh yeah, MARK called me today. We talked...well, he talked. I was a little more than 1/2 asleep haha so he's like u should dance since yer listening to ghetto music anyway im like ok so i did and then like passed out and he's still trying to talk to me and i'm like mark, hun, im sleeping. roar. anyway, then i talked to Mistress and SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND who mark says is going to hurt her so bad and " shatter her heart into a million pieces " but he's not going to tell her because everyone has to make those mistakes...only I want to save he but I don't have any evidence on why she shouldn't be with him except for what Mark told me so it will do NO GOOD as far as I am concerned right now. Hah, this morning I came across booktv on c-span2 and this dude Thomas Frank is a GENIUS let me tell you. :-D. I am now a "contemporary conservative" haha. Anyway yeah, yesterday, MY PARTY WAS CANCELLED. Matt and Indie came and hung out anyway and it was kinda fun and I taught then gook (haha SAY INDIE GOOKS....hahahahaha) anyway, ya had to be there. So. . . . .boredom. Blah. I talked to loverboy a little bit...and by a little bit I mean a realllllly little bit. AHhHhHhHh...yeah. He really doesn't like me, but whatever. I'm over it :-D I have my JOE back! Well, I don't exactly have him back back but we have a *DATE* for when he gets back from camp. The first real *date* I've been on in a long time...like...raar. Last time I went on a real date...yeah...not fun. Steven Lucia I will hate you for as long as I am alive. I'm getting bored. I miss Joe.

Nick Brown has disappeared again, apparently because of his computer this time, I don't know. Anyway, Dani, Lance and Ross I believe are going to play sum of the songs I wrote and I think Rose is gonna sing but I don't know, I've never heard her sing. Anyway, here's what I was working on today...its all just material that needs to be molded and stuff, but yeah, here ya go: I thought I was your ocean, your deep red sea Your walls dissolving into my waves, melting into me. I thought I was your filthy angel, lemonade tears and all you can eat. I thought you liked the way I cried, watering your seed. This was all to test my trust in you, To make me crave the lust in you. Please don’t let me fluster you, In your eyes I see how disgusting you’ve become. Your second chance blew up in your face. Standing pretty as I watch you fall from grace. In my black jeans, in your t-shirt, in my underwear of lace. I hope we never hug again ‘cause your embrace I am numb. You fed me fire till I burned You kissed me softly till it hurt You turned away when I tried to speak You loved me so strong I am weak You sang me all the songs I hate You tore out the pages of my fate I never liked your empathy Thanks for the pretend sympathy You taught me how to make-believe While I painted pictures of your deceit Step on a thorn, I’ll make you smile Wrap you up in nothingness And let you stay a while. Step on a thorn, bleed a while Wrap you up in nothingness, I can make you smile. Step on a thorn, bleed a while I bet I can make you smile. Your tranquility turns me on, I would like to make you scream. Nothing like a challenge To wake me from this dream. I’m waiting for the day you come find me and kill me I’m waiting for the night you go down on me and thrill me I’m waiting to be emptied and for you to refill me I’m waiting for a response from you, words that will chill me
one more thing... THE VILLAGE is an absolutely terrible movie. Don't waste yer quarters, hah! Erm, Zach's the man. Im prolly sleeping over DANIELLE's this friday. Word. Stroker and Hoop is FUNNY AS A MOTHERFUCKER.
Huffing is awesome! Heh...last night, wo. I mean like, heh. I'm stupid I know. Mistress is at God Camp, the other night I was over Mark's n she was there n we were chillin and it was coooool. Hmh. Long sleeves suck sometimes, but I am screwed cuz of what I did, and Mom is mad suspicious. Oh yeah, yesterday I got in a fught with her cuz of not eating...blech. Amy's gonna be home soon, I don't want this to be open when she gets home, n ima go get high cuz i have nothing better to do with my time. Dust. ps. there's a ladybug crawling along my monitor.
hmmm... well, well, well. Today is Inauguration day of 'our center' and it just happened in a flash. But it was memorable. Why? Because due to a sudden twist of events, I had to be the master of the ceremony - the emcee, that is. It was an impulsive decision to take the part and it was worth it. There were tounge-twisting moments and reading bloopers but i believe they were barely noticeable. I did fine and I'm glad I took the opportunity to speak publicly (eventhough it was just a brief stint). Darn, it feels good!I feel like I'm born to do it. Hehe. Yesterday was another euphoric day. I've heard from my oldest bestfriend through e-mail and i am so happy she wrote. Thanks a lot to friendster, I found her youngest sister who in turn informed her about me.She wouldn't have recognized me if not for my posted pictures in my profile. She said that she has been trying to contact me for ages but with no such luck. Nwez, she gave all her contact details and a brief account of what has happened to her through the years. She graduated, got her own store and a 2004 Mustang. Cool beans, huh? For someone my age, I guess she already accomplished a lot. I wonder if she already got married. I did ask her this question in my email to her so i'll just have to wait and see... Reuniting with an old bal brings a sense of nostalgia. I just couldn't help but reminisce about old times and reflect about the present as well. Somehow, I tend to ponder and analyze my current situation with that of my friends (one of human's natures?)I start to question how I fared so far - in life, generally. Well, success is something difficult to quantify. I think success is relative, a state of mind, really. It is something that can't be measured by material wealth, forune or fame one has achieved but rather by the fulfillment one feels with the things that she/he does. Success for me is going to sleep at night thinking that it feels good to be alive and feeling lucky to be where and who I am today. Well, there are symbols of status quo and I wouldn't be a hypocrite to admit that I would want some of these. But I wouldn't want to own some possessions which I think I don't deserve. I don't know but if one believes she/he is successful, everyone else follows - fulfillment, recognition, as well as the material rewards that go along with it. Success - an abstract term defined as the 'progressive realization of one's pre-determined goals'. Or something to that effect.And it got me asking myself, what are really my goals? Do I have concrete ones? Hmmm...
limbo. it's an area of uncertainty right? a certain space of floating and drifting to nothingness. Or maybe it's a transitional period - of reflecting and putting things into perspective before one proceed with a journey. It can also be a venue for resting, relaxing and unwinding or taking the time off from all the hustle and bustle of a very busy, complex and chaotic world. These and maybe the word means more. A lot more than I know. limbo.limbo rock.why was it called that, nway? well,i guess this takes another mind-boggling self-brainstorming session.
we don't need money to celebrate. yeah right! would anyone kindly tell me how to do that? i would really appreciate the rationalization. birthdays can sometimes be dreadful coz let's face it, we've got friends and they expect you to celebrate and they would love join the celebration. but when there's no means to celebrate, there's the dilemma. i mean, c'mon. how would one celebrate without spending? you need to have at least some food to share - and it's gonna cost for a group meal. sigh. money does make the world go round.and why do i have to be in this state in time for my upcoming birthday? my birthday could have been last month or in December. But i'm stuck with June when resources are scarce. talk about perfect timing...
How do one start a blog anyway? I know that this is suppposed to be an online journal - a venue where I can record my thoughts, opinions, ideas, and the likes. Much like a regular diary, only this one can be published and viewed by everyone. So much for privacy, huh? Going back to my question... Where do I begin exactly? Hmmm... It will almost come to the 24th year of my existence here on earth. I guess, I better take this as a take-off point. Wow, time does fly! It'll be a few more days before I turn 24 and sadly, I don't think it's going to be a bashful birthday. Why? For the mere reason that I'm in the middle of a financial crisis lately and I can't afford to throw even a simple party. I know that a party is not the only way to celebrate another year that was. I guess, I could just focus on the Thanksgiving part. I started associating Thanksgiving with my birthdays as soon as I realized what a blessed individual I am. So blessed that I felt the need to devote a day and be grateful. And what better day to offer all these thanks than on the day of each year which marks the end of meaningful years and the beginning of a hopeful one. Yes, it will be a new start for me. Here's another opportunity for me to fulfill my goals and desires, to realize my hopes and dreams as well as to atone whatever mistakes and shortcomings I've done in the past. I never did think of birthdays as growing older, just getting wiser. I hope that's what I have been doing so far... Advance birthday greetings to me.
i'm here at work early as usual. i'm scheduled for such ungodly hours and i don't know if i'll last. it can be pretty alarming commuting from home. paranoia gets into me, specially with all those horrendous news i see on TV - of kidnapping, hold-upping, snatching, rape, you name it. Jeez, just thinking about these crimes give me the shivers.i really need topractice leavingfor work earlier than what i have been doing. better safe than sorry.seems like the world is getting more and more dangerous to live in. or are we just more scared as we grow older? maturity comes with age, right? or is it with the amount of experiences and exposures that we get as time goes by? a friend gave me a little book from an Indian author which contained such profound statements. one of his passages saidthat our thoughts and experiences are not our own, and this got me thinking. when we think about it, from the time we were born, we have been sorrounded with a lot of different things as well as people. Thus, influenced by so many factors. We grew up around our parents or whoever raised us and our best way of learning is by mimicking them. It has been said that 5 years old is the time when all of the values that a parent wants to instill in his/her child, are already intact. after this period, a kid tends to be exposed to outside environment and explores a bigger world on his/her own. perhaps each person is unique. but we have to admit the fact that all of us have similar experiences, varied in some ways but still similar in nature. it's interesting to know that our lives are definitely intertwined and we are all connected to each other - whether we like it or not. what makes us special is the combination of experiences that we have and how we respond to these. this is what separates us from one another. we may encounter the same circumstances but we react differently. we rationalize in various manners depending on our biases and prejudices. we justify things based on our values.and these values that we acquire aren't actually ours. rather they are the product of who we were and who we becomes, eventually.fascinating. who would have thought that i'd be interested with philosophy - if one could consider my thoughts philosophies. it's funny how little we know of ourselves and realizing some things that define us. we barely notice it but other people define us. their thoughts, their words, their actions, their works help us better understand ourselves. they may talk to us directly or indirectly -through books, arts and other pieces of man's work which convey their thoughts, ideas and perspectives. communication is everywhere and it's just up to us which ones to pick up because these are the ones useful to us or what we think would be applicable to us. messages can be overwhelming and confusing at times that we tend to have a hard time segregating and organizing them to fit us. sometimes, out of confusion we get frustrated and lost. that's why we seek guidance to assist our dilemmas. that's why we need other people or anything that can keep our sanity intact. others hold on to a divine, supreme being for guidance. by believing that they exist for a reason and that their lives are part of a big plan is motivation enough to keep on going. and i believe this is a very effective way of leading one's life. sigh.i miss group discussions.intellectual masturbation, so to speak.ones that leave you still thinking even if the event has long been over. ones that create a huge impact on your values. ones that makes you doubt about your own belief system. ones that are so influential, they'll leave an unforgettable mark. i wonder when can i hear one again?
newsflash! i'm inspired again. thanks to Josephine March of Little Women. i hope this lasts. it's dawn again and we haven't been that productive. well, work-wise, that is. during the entire shift (although we're just halfway through the shift, i don't think there will still be calls coming in), i only received a single call. it was a good one considering that i made a sale, but not good enough 'coz i wasn't successful with any of the upsells. i must admit that i need polishing with my 'selling capabilities', most specifically my convincing power. one of my experienced (meaning well-adept with sales and has been to other call centers previously) teammates gave a lecture on coming up with effective rebuttals during calls and while he was sharing what he knows and what he learned, i realized that i still have a lot to practice. problem is, there isn't much opportunity right now. we only get to receive at most 3 calls (that is if one is lucky enough) during a shift and these calls are certainly not enough. oh well, i hope more calls would keep coming in the coming days. i can't wait to apply what i recently learned and improve myself. it's pretty addicting once you already experienced handling the live call. so far, i have only talked to 4 people and the first 1 hung up on me, the 2nd changed her mind because i placed her on hold for a considerably lobg time, and the last 2 ones bought just the base product (which is a set of knives, actually). frankly, i'm not yet used to persuading other people to buy something mainly because i'm a thrift shopper myself. i have always been a practical one and i believe that i don't have to acquire stuffs that i don't need. now, i'm in a business where i have to charm people into agreeing with me and spending some of their money into items that aren't really necessities. it's a tough act and i bet it would some time for me to master the 'art of selling'. come to think of it. being a salesperson is actually similar to being a lawyer wherein both have to prepare for rebuttals or arguments in order to succeed - either to sell a product or win a case. A salesperson needs to convince and explain to a prospective customer while a lawyer needs to convince and explain to a jury or a judge. The former formulates rebuttals based on the merits of a certain product or service while the latter creates arguments based on the evidences of a particular case. And both profession requires a very effective oral communication skills. This is quite interesting. One of my greatest dreams is to be a lawyer. this is primarily because of Ally McBeal. The show depicts an exciting courtroom drama and comedy that i couldn't help but wish to be a part of it. But i know now that being a lawyer is more that just intriguing cases, winning speeches and victorious parties with colleagues in a bar. The profession is much more complicated than these. I do hope to deliver a winning speech someday and a victory party as well. For what specific reason, i have no idea. another great dream of mine is to be an author. i have always been fond of reading and i deeply admire those who can wonderfully weave stories and tales which captures a lot of imagination. My huge respect goes to those writers who can fuel plenty of people's dreams and aspirations, who can create a spark with her/his readers, who can ignite the innermost longings and hopeful thoughts of many individuals. words are indeed very powerful. they can open hearts, release sorrow, arouse joy, give hope and inspiration. they can change lives. truly, blessed are those who can create magic out of words. they hold great power. ~~~ there are so much things to write about. from one's own experiences to accounts of others stories. from objects to human beings. from abstract to concrete ideas. but what makes a good writer? i've read from a book that a composition with impeccable grammatical composition nor does an interesting piece filled with grammatical errors, doesn't guarantee a bestseller (meaning a good read for many). Then what does? Obviously, it has to have a balance of both. A good story not only requires appropriate grammatical style but an interesting tone as well. Most importantly, it must connect with the target reader. otherwise, the whole process of writing would be pointless. so how do i do this exactly? well, first things first. who are my target readers and what do i want to tell them? what am i willing to share? hmmm...
ei, check this out! urlLink peyups or urlLink Email me!
here i am again. living a new life. making changes. adjusting to new things. i guess, as we grow older, there tend to be more changes. life gets more fast-paced and we have less room to breathe. one moment we belong somewhere and doing something. the next thing we knew, we're in a different place, with different sets of people. old comfort zone has to be thrashed and new ones are developed. i wonder how long (or how short) will this last this time? people. places. culture. at first, it's exciting to to explore and expand our horizon. but as we go further and we see more, we wonder what's in store for us. or whether there's really something splendid in store for us. dreams. goals. objectives. i'm sure everyone has these. each person believes that he/she has a purpose in life. every individual harbors some purpose during his existence. others may be confused. torn between what she/he can do with what she/he really wants to do. desires. ambitions. it's human nature to want something that doesn't belong to him or her. of course, why would you look for something if you already have it. common sense, right? but how do we distinguish what we need from what we want? 'coz what we want doesn't necessarily means that they're what we need. yes, it's a different thing and it's something that's so hard to figure out. we want something because we think we need it. how do we know that we really need it. can we decide for ourselves? can we justify what's right for us? does the decision lie solely on us? the answers maybe coincids with our quest for happiness? but does it have to be one's own happiness only? wouldn't it be selfish that way? well, maybe depending on ones's definition of happiness. but then again, this should be another thought to ponder.
it's fascinating how one's persona redeems itself. whoever said that 'first impression is lasting' is a closed-minded individual. i say that we should give every person a chance. of course, first impressions are there but we shouldn't make it last. we can assess one's personality according to how we see him/her at first but let's get to know the same peson better and i'm sure the impressions can change - be it for the better or otherwise. why did i come to the above realization? well, i've been somewhat relieved when i heard one of our sups talk earlier today. she made a lot of sense, unlike the other two. at first, she struck me as someone who's irresponsible and unprofessional. but obviously, i was wrong. she actually provided good pointers earlier which made me realize that she knows a lot and she knows what we are doing. i guess, this is a silent apology for her. even though, she does not know (i hope) how i misjudged her, still i owe her this. ~~
jeez! i dunno what went wrong. i've been trying to access this account for a few days now and i couldn't. i'm sure i had the correct username and password but my account was blocked somehow. finally, i'm here again. maybe, someone took pity on me. maybe, i was just really doing the wrong thing. whichever the case, i'm just glad i can write again and not start from scratch. i kinda developed an attachment to this particular account already. comfort zone. it's something so easy to acquire and yet very difficult to let go. a comfort zone can be developed in as short as a few minutes or as long as some years. nevertheless, we create something to hold on to. some habit we get used to and as days go by, it's something that is so hard to change. so what have i been up to lately? thoughts. so much thoughts. things that occupy my mind these days range from deep to shallow to romantic to tragic and so on and so forth. maybe, i'll just lash them out in random. a weird friend who pops up once in a while... a new job with nothing much at this time... an old friend who sent a mail with such deep impact... a traumatic dog-incident late one night... a contemplation of what has been, what is and what could be... an analysis of being in power... a vivid image of some sexual fantasies... a clear situation opportunity i've allowed to pass by... a lot of grieving thoughts on our country's sorry state... a depressing realization that i'm part of this state... keeping in touch with friends, old and new... catching up with someone whom i haven't heard from for sometime... status quo symbols.... the difference between wealth and poverty - access to resources... friendster and its advantages... books and how i love them... shopaholic - a friend and a book... money and why i badly need them right now... lovelife and what it constitutes... who am i right now?... where am i?... friends... casual sex... money... wealth... social life... spirituality... challenges... time... life... existence... chaos... complexities.
just read an e-mail from an old friend and her words totally affected me. she's in the US right now and you could say that she's living the life. she has this great job and she's not modest enough to hide the fact that she's earning so much and that she can easily get what she wants, whenever she wants them. i dunno but somehow i can't help but think that i don't know her anymore. maybe, it's the fact that we're miles apart and it has been ages since i last saw her. but the distance is more than just physical. she is a different person now. she has obviously embraced the american culture and she now thinks like a typical american girl. that is, with high regards of herself. i was kinda hurt with the way she looked down at Asians who can barely speak english, not minding that she is technically an Asian herself. she was so pissed off dealing with them that i wouldn't be surprised if she gets mad at me defending their position. it's scary how money and power can get into us. she even went as to belittling her country herself asking me of what's keeping me here when there is nothing for me to stay. well, true enough. there's poverty-driven problems around. but these are what keeps us tough and oh well, i guess it would be best if i just post her email and my response to it. I deleted some details which I think are unnecessary. Nwez, here goes... HI! So sorry for not being able to reply back. I have been very busy with work lately. My staff is mainly consist of immature (yeah, and they're like what, between the ages of 18 and 30) and that means a lot of supervision. It's annoying sometimes but I have to deal with them because I am the store manager after all right? Even my right hand, which is my assistant manager, sometimes can't lead the floor. I constantly have to be there. It's like, I am put in that store to remind everyone of how things are supposed to be. I know that the old store manager didn't do a great job on them. She is so lenient and let you get away with things when I am totally the opposite. I am nice but if you push the wrong button, I can be a bitch. I think that most of us have our limits and mine is not that long. I am working on it though because I know that I have to do. I can't ran a business like that if my patience is short. And u know what tick me off the most, too, is the mall that I work at. My clientele is full of Asian, who for goodness sake barely know how to speak English. It's so damn annoying trying to do an action language to them because it makes me look stupid. How the hell do you get to United States without knowing a word in English? Isn't that pathetic? I might sound so mean and totally out of line here, but it's true though. How are they going to survive like that? Well, I guess I am grumpy right now. Sorry, what I think I'm doing is venting. It just gets upsetting sometimes, and it's not like you'll always have translator around or something like that. Anyways, I've been good. Lots of happs (short for happenings) here and there. We just finished celebrating one of my nephews b-day. I got 2 more to celebrate this month. I'll try to send u pictures. Lately, I have been hating photo shoots though because I haven't gotten my tan yet and I look too white in picture. Plus my boyfriend is not photogenic at all, so that makes me like it least. On th 7th, I have to go on a trip with my boyfriend's family (his cousin is actually getting married and they are having the bachelorette and bachelor party) at Catalina Island. Heard of the place? I am not that excited to go but the trip has been paid for, and if I cancel, they will have to pay more. The only thing that I am looking forward of is the tanning part. It'll be nice and hot out there. I'll be toast by the time I come back. =) I am thrilled too because on September, i am going to a Linkin Park concert. I have been to a bunch of their concerts and this one is supposed to be great because it has a collaboration of a bunch of different artists such as Snoop Dogg. I like them a lot and I can't wait. They're really good live. Chester, the lead singer, is awesome. Now that I think about it, I wonder what my life would be like had me and my family stayed there. I wouldn't want to imagine what my lifestyle would be like though. I mean, no offense to you and to anyone else who's still living in our country, but let's be realistic. What else is still left for everyone there? When u get the opportunity to make it here, don't even think twice. U need to grab that and really try your hardest to make it here. The opportunity is not only here but everything else. I mean, we necessarily don't pick up golds or money on the street just like what most people think, but money is so much easier, yet quicker to be spent. For my age, I seriously make so much money, but because I have so much expenses, not to mention 8 credit cards that have been cut now, I barely see that money. I don't ask my parents for money at all, unless I am down to a penny in my bank. I pay for everything. I am so used to it. I have so much freedom to spend my money on whatever I want... yeah, my closet by the way is exploding. I love clotehs, and I love to shop! That's all I dis especially when I went to FIDM ( The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising) . When I am in a foul mood, my boyfriend would know to give me his credit card so I can shop. I shop so much that I get sick afterwards. It's like a disease... I know a lot of us females love to shop, but with my case, it's different. I have no control whatsoever. If I want it, I'll get. What size do u wear anyways? Every season, I do an inventory on my clothes and by the time I'm done, I will have 3 big bags that are all full of clothes. I usually give it to a charity, but lately, I have been giving it to my co-workers. Make it worth it. My boyfriend have suggested to put it up on e-bay to make money, but it's just an idea. We haven't really thought of it. Maybe later on. I wish that u're here so I can give it all to you. My sense of fashion though has been changing so quickly lately. It's more of a fad than fashion now. I wear clothes that make me stand out on the crowd, something original. I hate knock-offs... it's all about originality. I did my inventory recently and I just discovered that I have 60 belts and chains, 80 pairs of shoes, not even including flip flops, and about 70 pairs of jeans. Wow!!! But anyways, I got to go. I didn't realize that I have written this nonsense mail to u forever now, so I must stop. I'll try to catch up with u via e-mail. Sorry, will u e-mail me back ur address and phone #. I lost it. Ciao!!! and here's my reply: Whoa! You were venting all right. So much that i could almost hear your blood boiling all the way out here. Hope you have already managed to simmer down by now. =) Well, you do have great responsibilities out there and i'm sure it can be trying at times. But just like you said, you are the manager and with the position comes a great deal of power. Use it to your advantage. However, be reminded of Peter Parker's words as well (or was it his grandmother's?) that "with great power comes greater responsibilities". ü I can totally relate to your encounter with Asians who can barely speak English. I had a call myself a few days ago with a Chinese customer and she was really having a hard time expressing herself. She even asked me if we had a Chinese agent around. Unfortunately, we don't so i just told her that she was doing a great job and that i could perfectly understand her. I could also hear her constantly discussing with her father, who was obviously with her in the room, in Chinese. Our conversation lasted for 40 minutes and i was supposed to have it in less than 10 minutes 'coz we have this standards to follow. But i decided that it was fine, it was just one call after all. Besides, it felt good to be of help to someone. My heart just goes out to these people. And i realized that we're lucky we're here in the Philippines 'coz english gets to be our second language. Compared to other Asian nations, we fare well in terms of communicationg globally. Thus, it's also easier for us to adapt anywhere. Have I ever told u that i tutored Koreans and Japanese before? They have to come all the way here because internationally, we are the 3rd best English-speaking country. And I guess, this is something to be proud of. Yeah, you're very lucky you're there and I wouldn't be a hypocrite to deny the fact that I would love to be in the same shoes that you are right now, given the opportunity of course. Actually, I'm planning to get out of here one of these days. Hopefully, even somewhere in Europe. I dunno how i'm gonna do it though. It's just a plan. But you know what, it isn't that bad. I may not get everything that I want but I believe that have everything that I need. ü Funny how you badly need that tan when tanned people out here go crazy over those whitening creams and stuffs to lighten their complexions. Human nature, huh? We just can't seem to be satisfied... Feel free to send your inventory rejects if it wouldn't cost you that much trouble. I would love to have them over. =p Thanks for keeping in touch. Till next time. Keep calm! ;-) ~author

I had a brief dream the other night. I must preface this with telling you about my ganglion cyst. After a car accident we had in 2002, I developed a bump on the top of my wrist that seemed firm, but pliable. This bump grew in size over a series of months and most times didn't inconvenience or hurt, though I felt it unsightly. Occasionally it would seem to press on nerves and cause some arthritic like pain in my wrist. One time when I twisted my wrist in an unnatural manner opening a refrigerator door in a store, it immediately went away. What it is is a buildup of the fluid your body produces to lubricate your joints....through some kind of trauma, a hole and pocket is created into which the fluid leaks and builds up. Occasionally another trauma (such as hitting it with a large book which was the folk remedy for this illness people have called a "Bible Bump") or surgery can make it go away,but it is always possible for it to return. Mine has come and gone and currently it is in the gone phase. It is an anomaly, but doesn't really bother me too terribly enough to have surgery to attempt to permanently remove it. Most times these occur on the top of the wrist, though others have gotten them at their ankles, the joint of their thumb, or elsewhere. WEll, anyway, I had a dream the other evening that I developed something similar on the top rear right side of my head. I was scratching my head and felt a bump that was getting larger......this lump continued to grow to my horror until it finally stopped and I felt it underneath my hair and skin......and it felt similar in pliability and firmness to my ganglion cyst. At that point I woke up. I have to ponder this one to figure out the potential meaning behind it.
7/7/04 I dreamed that terrorists somehow undermined the internet infrastructure and caused the global economy to collapse, the electrical grid to go down and as a result there was looting, riots, collapse of the government at least here in the U.S., and a variety of other horrific scenarios. In my dream I was watching the information about this on a TV even though the power was out supposedly. I felt a fear rising in my throat, climbing up every vertebra in my neck like an ooze. My husband was packing for us to flee to a campground we visit often that would have their doors open for friends. I woke up shocked and the dream had felt so real at the time. This was before the most recent announcement of the threat by our Dept. Of Homeland INsecurity. I tend to see these announced threats now as a political ploy......especially in this election year. I fear that Bush will attempt to postpone the election more than I fear an actual attack at this point. But the dream was very disturbing nonetheless. I don't know how realistic the scenario is because I don't know what security measures are in place on the computer networks of places like the various stock exchanges around the world or the banks...or the government for that matter.
