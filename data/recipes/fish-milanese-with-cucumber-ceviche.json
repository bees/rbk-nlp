        "Cook cilantro in a medium pot of boiling salted water until wilted, about 20 seconds. Drain and transfer cilantro to a bowl of ice water. Swish around in water to cool. Drain, then squeeze excess liquid from herbs with your hands.", 
        "Pur\u00e9e cilantro, ginger, and 2 Tbsp. water in a blender until almost smooth. With motor running, gradually stream in oil and blend until smooth. Strain cilantro oil through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl; discard any solids. Mix lime juice into oil and season with salt.",

        "Process panko in a food processor until very finely ground (it will only take 45\u201360 seconds). Transfer to a shallow bowl. Place egg yolks in another shallow bowl and whisk in buttermilk. Place cornstarch in a third shallow bowl. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels and set a wire rack inside.", 
        "Working with 1 fillet at a time, season with kosher salt on both sides and dredge in cornstarch, shaking off excess. Dip in egg mixture, letting excess drip back into bowl, then coat in panko, pressing to adhere before shaking off excess. Repeat steps to make a second coating. Place on a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining fillets.",

Heat oil over medium-high until an instant-read thermometer registers 350\u00b0F\u2013365\u00b0F (Don\u2019t let the tip of the thermometer touch the bottom of the skillet). Carefully lower a fillet along the side of skillet closest to you and let slide away from you into oil. Carefully swirl oil in skillet and cook fish just until golden on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Using a fish spatula or slotted spoon, carefully turn fish over and cook until golden on the other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer fish to wire rack in prepared baking sheet and season with sea salt while still hot. Repeat with remaining fillets.",
