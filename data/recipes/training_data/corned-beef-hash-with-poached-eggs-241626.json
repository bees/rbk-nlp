Pour enough water into large nonstick skillet to reach depth of 1 1/2 inches; add 1 teaspoon salt and bring to simmer. Crack each egg into separate custard cup. Working with 4 eggs per batch, gently slide 1 egg at a time into simmering water in skillet. Cook just until egg whites are set, about 1 minute (yolks will be only partially cooked). Using slotted spoon, carefully transfer eggs to prepared roasting pan with water. Reserve skillet with water. DO AHEAD: Poached eggs can be made 1 hour ahead. Let stand at room temperature.",
