        "Create an herb bundle (bouquet garni): Place the thyme sprigs, celery, and bay leaf in a neat pile, then secure them together by wrapping tightly crosswise with a piece of twine. Set aside.", 
        "In a large pot, add the ventr\u00e8che, beans, potatoes, sliced garlic, carrots, leeks, onion, turnip, cabbage, the bouquet garni, a tablespoon of kosher salt, and the peppercorns. Add 2 quarts of fresh water, cover the pot, and bring the liquid to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, lower the heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and continue to cook until the vegetables are tender and the beans are nearly tender, 50\u201360 minutes. Take the duck legs by the ankle and use them to stir the pot a few times before dropping them into the soup. Continue cooking until the beans are tender and the duck meat easily falls off the bone when poked with a fork, 25\u201330 minutes. Let the glossy skin slip off into the soup, then remove and discard the bones, and break the meat into smaller pieces.", 
        "When ready to serve, prepare the garnish: In a medium skillet, warm the duck fat over medium heat. Add the Jambon de Bayonne in batches and cook in a single layer, turning once, until lightly browned and crispy, about 4 minutes per side.", 
        "Rub each slice of bread with one of the garlic halves and distribute the slices between 6 wide, shallow soup bowls. Ladle the soup over the bread. Drape a slice of griddled ham atop each bowl and serve immediately."
