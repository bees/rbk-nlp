        "Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch baking dish, then line it with foil or parchment paper.", 
        "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, duck fat, sugar, and salt on medium speed until pale and fluffy, 1\u20132 minutes. Add the egg and continue beating until combined. Turn off the mixer, add the flour, and pulse on low speed until a dough just comes together.", 
        "Scrape the dough into the prepared pan and spread into an even, \u00bd-inch-thick layer. Use a sharp, thin knife to lightly score the surface into 3x1-inch rectangles (do not cut all the way through), then use a skewer to poke 2 holes into each rectangle.", 
        "Refrigerate until the dough is chilled solid, 1 hour.", 
        "Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake, rotating once halfway through, until the dough is set and just barely browned at the edges, 16-18 minutes.", 
        "While the shortbread is still hot, use a thin knife to neatly slice into rectangles. Let cool completely in the pan before removing and serving."
