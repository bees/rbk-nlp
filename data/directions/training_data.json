'The \"Life-Bringers\", those created by the Creator, finished bringing the last of life to the land and for a time were satisifed as was the Creator. For a great length of time, there was a great peace the Life-Bringers as well as all life living in the Realm. However, this period of peace did not last as long as hoped by the Creator for a shadow from unknown source. After the appearance of this darkness, several of the \"Life-Bringers\" began to talk and complain on how unfair they were being treated and soon begin crying that they deserve rule over the life and realm they created. However, the Creator refused to surrender saying no one deserved to rule over the realm since all life in the realm were free without a ruler, though it fell upon deaf ears. Soon more \"Life-Bringers\" began to join those whole already beginning to speak of rebellion against the Creator. Soon fighting began amongst the \"Life-Bringers\" which broke out into an all-out war. However, the Generals of the \"Life-Bringers\" were able to quickly to organize an army and fight the Rebellious Ones successfully. On the verge of defeat, the Rebellious Ones retreated into the Realm before they were forced to surrender. Upon landing in the \"Realm\" their forms changed to that of hideous horrible monsters yet the same lust for power and jealousy that forced them into the realm grew greatly. They began to terrorize all life in the realm even attacking those \"Life-Bringers\" who had entered the realm before the rebellion and had taken on a form. They had no control over their emotions or actions, only the rage and lust for destruction that filled them when they fought against their fellow \"Life-Bringers\". The cries of the life could be heard by the \"Life-Bringers\" who watched in horror as their creations suffered great pain and feeling this pain, they pleaded to the Creator to do something. First, \"Life-Bringers\" were allowed to bring as much of the life on the realm to safety including those later known as the Ancient Clan as well as many others. This was still not enough though as most of the life did not understand the \"messengers\" or were too frightened to leave. Then it was allowed that many \"Life-Bringers\" could travel to the Realm to fight these Monsters and so they departed entering the realm. Many of them took the form of the complex yet fragile lifeform of humans. However, when they awoke from their journey, they were disoriented with no memory of where they had come from nor their purpose in being in the realm and were scattered across the land. They wandered across the land and soon were by those of the Ancient Clan. Though confused upon why they did not remember were they came from, they were accepted and allowed refugee in the Great Hall were they stayed for a time as the monsters continued to ravage the land' \u00a9 Roberto Marquez\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Evening: I decided to create this blog to chronicle my writings rather then my daily life which you can probably read at urlLink my LiveJournal .

The Realm of Entelle Well where to start is the stories that helped me develop what I have thought of so far. As I said in a previous post, I am a huge fan of Tolkien and after rereading several of his works, I have been given many ideas but I am being careful in trying to make my works unique. The actual ideal of the world actually started many years ago about 1998 or 1999 in which I gave the realm the name called Entelle. In order to make it different from Tolkien and many other writers, I decided to make the realm a complete island world with many islands surrounding it and therefore the name in an ancient language is called the Island Realm. I will attempt to write and later add onto the description/names as I am still devising a language system: The Second Age (Rough Draft) The Realm of Entelle has been through many changes. The name given, by the those known in legends as the Life Bringers, was the Island Realm as it has many chains of islands. Before becoming under the Destructive Wrath, the Great Land covered almost the entire realm. Four mountains surrounded all sides of the land leaving a large plains/valleys with many beautiful forests though most of it was chopped down by the men who came to live there. It is said because of this, many scars where left behind including desolated lands where no life exists and many marshes due to flooding, the punishment for such destruction. The Moutains of the North have been named the Cursed as a large evil was known to live there and it is said that in beyond them is the Ice Field as well as the Mist, said to be the source of all evil. A large sacred river seperated the mountains and the Plains. It is said to flow southeastern, disappearing into the mysterious eastern moutains though there are many tribunies that flow from it southward form many lakes and rivers. The eastern moutains is said where the wise Dragons live along with the people known as the Riders. It is said within the mountains amount of caves, dens where the dragons once dwelled. There are also many halls, home of the Riders of the East, containing the largest amount of information recorded in the entire realm. Said to have remained undamaged even after the invasion of the hall, it was never found until near after the Final Defeat. Beyond the mountains of the south is a coast where many mariners live. It is said that this is where many of the exiles fled first. After the construction of the first fleet, many sailed away to the other island but few remained behind and built many sea towns that is strung along the coast. At the time, only one island chain was well known as it became the leading island after the Destructive Wrath to follow.

Newer versions such as the NIV say \"and be united to his wife.\" Not only does it speak of bonding, but the connotation of the word is implied by having been used in conjunction with the (presumably) inseparable bond of marriage. \"What God has joined let no man put asunder!\" Doesn't cleave, by way of the cleaver, also support a strong connotation? A cleaver is used to separate thick hunks of meat \u2013 even to power its way through bone! Once, i was making a hamburger for myself. i had a two-pound tube of frozen hamburger but only enough appetite for one-pound. i considered my options for splitting the tube in twain, and quickly decided on the cleaver. With one moderate swing, the cleaver popped the hamburger apart and sent the two halves flying five feet in opposite directions. i was impressed! its name is what it does, and it does it very well. The meanings of these words are very clear; so, we must wonder \u2013 Can a word really be its own antonym? As strange as it sounds, the answer is yes! Look at these definitions of cleave from Dictionary.com . cleave1 (kl v) v. cleft, (kl ft) or cleaved or clove (kl v) cleft, or cleaved or clo\u2022ven (kl v n) cleav\u2022ing, cleaves v. tr. 1. To split with or as if with a sharp instrument. See Synonyms at tear1. 2. To make or accomplish by or as if by cutting: cleave a path through the ice. 3. To pierce or penetrate: The wings cleaved the foggy air. 4. Chemistry. To split (a complex molecule) into simpler molecules. cleave2 (kl v) intr.v. cleaved, cleav\u2022ing, cleaves 1. To adhere, cling, or stick fast. 2. To be faithful: cleave to one's principles. To make things even more bizarre, \"cleaver\" is also an acceptable term for an adhesive. Also in the case of both definitions, a cleaver can be any person performing the act of cleaving. So, as an amateur cleaver, you might accidentally cleave your cutting board with your cleaver, but all you need is a cleaver with a good strong wood cleaver to cleave your cutting board back together.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "We must not get drawn into the idea that animals have the same rights as humans. As with all of God's creations, it is wrong to abuse them, but all that is in and on and around this world was given to us by God for our own use and enjoyment. The idea that animals are akin to humans is ultimately rooted in the theory of evolution; however, many people\u2019s beliefs are based on their own observations of animal behaviour. Anyone who has had a pet knows that animals develop a \"personality,\" but this is nothing more than learned behaviour. Animals learn through positive and negative reinforcement that certain actions yield certain results, and more intelligent animals learn more easily and appear more \"human.\" A dog has instinctual urges to eat, play, even get pet, and it has learned behaviours that relieve these involuntary pressures. What then, you may ask, is the difference between animals and humans? The answer to that lies within the implications of my last statement. Animals do not have desires. Closely tied to this is my assertion that animals are not sentient; they are not self-aware. Sentience is not a product of intelligence but of something much grander; for, it is not based in the natural but in the supernatural. Sentience is a product of the spirit. Many scientists, as you can imagine, do not agree with this. That sentience is spiritual is a creationistic idea, only awkwardly fitting into evolutionism. Microevolution, or adaptation, is happening all around us everyday. Species are always changing to better exist in their environment. This is a scientific fact. Macroevolution, the origin of the species, is the idea that over inconceivably long periods of time these adaptations produced the many species that exist today, and this is what i do not believe. While species are always changing, a cat is still a cat, a fish is still a fish, an eggplant is still an eggplant \u2026 you get the idea. While i have scores of problems with evolutionism, most of these have been vigorously debated for decades and have lost much of their intellectual appeal. My biggest problem; however, is this topic of sentience. Even from a wholly non-creationistic viewpoint, i find it problematic. Can sentience really evolve from nonsentient creatures? if the answer is yes, then sentience must have simply been an adaptation, a means by which to more easily exist within the environment. Can this be? Macroevolution is based upon the principle of reduction of energy, or efficiency. Ask yourself this question \u2013 is choice (or doubt) more efficient than instinct?\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "So, i just typed four paragraphs entitled \"Sentience, Evolution Animal Personification.\" i accidentally hit enter after typing the title, and i lost everything. i feel like crap. i'm gonna go buy some ice cream and go home.

You know, \"a family company.\" Anyway, that's why i've been out for so long. As i walk around doing all of my wonderful work, i walk through many doors. Now, many years ago, walking through doors as a child, i thought to myself \"i'm not going to push on that metal plate thing they put there, because everyone else touches that when they open the door, so that's were the most germs are.\" i'm not sure why this concerned me because i've never really bothered avoiding germs. i've eaten moldy food without care, i routinely eat food off any floor, and i'll finish anyone's drink. But, i've digressed. Again, i avoided the push-plates. Now, sometime last week i was entering the mens restroom, as i've been known to do from time to time, and as always, i avoided the metal push-plate. As i said before, germs don't bother me, so this practice continued purely out of habit. But last week, as i entered the fifth floor mens restroom of building forty, i noticed the door - the part of the door directly around the push-plate. Do you know what i saw? i saw the warn and discoloured wood where everyone else was apparently also avoiding the metal plate. So, i've changed my habits; i push the metal plate, now. i was clearly not avoiding germs on the wood, and i'm still not on the metal, but again, the germs don't really bother me. And of course, the plate is there for the very purpose of eliminating the wearing and discolouring of the wood. So, the question is, \"What damage are you doing simply because your actions are habitual?\" Really ask yourself, \"What are the things i do just because .\" Maybe you hit the bars every Friday night, because that's what you do Friday nights. You drop a ton of money, get drunk, and spend at least half the day Saturday recovering. You do damage to yourself and those close to you for some reason, which is probably long forgotten and very likely erroneous in the first place. Maybe its something different for you, maybe you avoid church. i've met so many people that don't go to church because they have a problem with the church people, like they expect church-goers to be something other than human. The truth is, you can't avoid the germs, but you can work to preserve rather than destroy. But, to really understand my analogy, you must realize that church is not that protecting plate, God is. Plenty of church-goers routinely do terribly destructive things because they think going to church (or saying prayers or reading the Bible) makes them good, but it is God's spirit that makes us good. isn't it time you let go of your fear of germs (of human actions) and embrace the purposed protection of God?\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Mom and Dad, tell us about your first homes when you were both kids (your earliest recollections).

Many of these Jerry Folwell types go as far as to label any non- Republican a sinner. first of all- I all ways thought that Politics was something that has, more than anything else, split up brothers and sisters in Christ. I distinctly remember one time having a conversation with my pastor, at the time. He started talking about politics. We had never talked about politics before so he never knew my \"southpaw\" tendencies when it came to politics. He said \"Oh, you are into politics? What party are you? Wait wait, I don't even know why I ask caus' if you're a Christian, you must be a Republican.\" Now, I always knew that there was always a right leaning tendency when it came to the church- especially Baptists, but I didn't it was to the ridiculous point to where one's faith would be questioned if they weren't a Republican.

You be the judge, I am truly in search of the correct writing style for me . ------------------- From the course definition, \"Philosophy is the thoughtful examination of the basic issues and questions of life and existence. Philosophy concerns itself with what is most abstract and fundamental. Philosophy is the quest for knowledge and wisdom. Philosophy is thinking as opposed to just believing. Although philosophy emphasizes the importance of reason and logic in seeking knowledge, it also emphasizes an openness and freedom of inquiry. Nothing is assumed or taken for granted - all ideas and principles are open to debate and discussion. Philosophy is democracy in practice. Philosophy is more though than just an intellectual enterprise - philosophy is a passion and a love for thinking, inquiry, and insight. Philosophy is a sense of wonder in the face of existence. Philosophy is both imaginative and practical. You will be asked to open your mind to an incredible assortment of new ideas and to apply these ideas to your own life and views of reality. Philosophy has a history and tradition stretching back at least as far as the Ancient Greeks and Chinese (600 - 300 BC). Yet philosophy has developed and evolved over the last two thousand years. There is a contemporary philosophical world of issues and new theories. Philosophy is an area of issues and competing points of view. There are answers in philosophy, but many as opposed to one, and there are questions, disagreements, and perplexities. The ideal of philosophy - in fact, of all wisdom and thinking - is to journey rather than arrive. \"\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Define each of the following theories or views of ethics and morality. Define each theory in a few sentences. Which views do you support? Which do you disagree with? Provide at least one reason why you support each of the views that you agree with. Provide at least one reason why you don't support each of the views that you disagree with. *Hedonism, Egoism, Kant's Duty Theory, Consequentialism, Aristotle's Virtue Theory, Moral Absolutism, Moral Relativism, Nietzsche's Critique of Morality* A kind of egoism where one holds the belief that the purpose of life is to have pleasure is called hedonism . I would not support hedonism. I suspect that some who have hedonist tendencies may use pleasure as a form of distraction or escape as a way of not dealing with life. Just as a food addict or alcoholic escapes the anxieties of life. I wonder if pleasure seeking hedonistic behavior is the same. Egoism is the idea that people only act or behave to gain a benefit. It implies that people even perform seemingly unselfish actions just to avoid guilt or bad feelings. The branches of the \u201cgood life\u201d our text covers such as success, ascetics, freedom, and hedonism are all kinds of egoism. I think I would support the theory of egoism. I think humans by nature act to benefit their selves. We are trained to behave this way early on. First, as children, to avoid punishments, we behave to avoid negative repercussions. I doubt that there is really altruism. I think it is a sense of pride we feel when we do something for others. I think it is a self pride that is not often recognized as we carry out our good deeds. Kant in his duty theory implies that our morality comes from our sense of duty. The textbook gives the Ten Commandments as an example. The text implies that the Ten Commandments are laws from God that came from \u201coutside of us\u201d. I don\u2019t think I agree with this. For some reason I hold the belief that the laws were given to the Israelites because they needed it or demanded it. I think there are some interpretations that would argue that Moses in trying to keep order, first established judges at the suggestion of his father \u2013 in \u2013 law and then I think the commandments were the next step as the people demanded rules. I think the people gave up the freedom and grace of God for the law, because they did not feel comfortable being free. Maybe this was because they had been enslaved by Egyptians for years. It is as if they enslaved themselves to the law by choice. They needed rules because it was more comfortable, more predictable than living by faith and guidance day to day from an unseen God. Maybe they had no morals before the ten commandments? Consequentialism judges a behavior or action as good or bad based on the results rather than the intent. Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism that believes moral decisions should be made for the good and happiness of the greatest number of people. Jeremy Bentham came up with the happiness calculus to evaluate actions. John Stuart Mill developed ideas further by adding a quality aspect to the calculus. I think I disagree with this theory that the outcome that satisfies the greatest number of people in society is best. I think about children who have decisions made for them by dysfunctional families or societies. This could make children \u201cexpendable\u201d in some situations. Aristotle\u2019s list of virtues is a list of qualities he thought one should strive to possess not only for personal happiness, but also to benefit one\u2019s community. Since these virtues would benefit society and individual, it reflects the utilitarianism view of benefiting the most people. I think Aristotle\u2019s virtues are a good guideline for a person to aim for. I think a person should strive for a balance of behavior. In our society, we have seen the problems that come from extreme imbalance of character, like having too much pride, or not keeping a temper in check. The belief that there are moral principles that are universal and that they should be followed by everyone is moral absolutism . This theory also deems a group of people immoral if they do not follow the universal moral values. I don\u2019t agree with moral absolutism, because it is difficult to judge a society\u2019s or culture\u2019s actions if we don\u2019t understand their motives. This is difficult, because I have a belief that universally, for example, child abuse should be wrong. If I saw child abuse in another culture, I might judge the people as immoral. But maybe I saw one small part of a bigger picture I could never understand. Or maybe the abused child would welcome someone saying, \u201chey, universally, we the other part of the world view this is wrong and will protect you.\u201d This situation actually happened to me as I viewed a mother as too strict with her child on an airplane. Someone else countered my view and said that in the culture and environment this child had to live in, they needed a strong, strict mother to survive. It was easy for me to judge what I did not understand. Opposite of moral absolutism is moral relativism which says that individual cultures and societies have their own moral principles that are right for them. This theory advocates tolerance that other peoples have a right to choose what is right and wrong. I think I could agree with this theory as long as people had individual choice and freedom. I think about the Iraqi people being ruled by Saddam for decades. From one view we might see the happy, \u201cin control\u201d fa\u00e7ade he wanted us to see, where time and time again he was elected to rule his people. On the other view, his people didn\u2019t seem to have the knowledge or freedom to choose what they wanted. How could this culture choose what is \u201cright for them\u201d? If a people have the freedom to choose their morals, then moral relativism is a good idea. Nietzsche valued creativity, self expression and power. He was against Christian morals and the hypocrisy that developed with it. I think I agree with much of his critique of morality. I think the harsh morals put a heavy burden of mistrust on society. For instance, if a child is treated with trust they can more freely develop their personality and creativity. Morals become a comparing point of who is holier than thou, or which is the worst sin. I think for modern times we should be careful to not allow the new diversity and tolerance thinking to become the morals of our day. It seems everywhere we turn our government and big companies are trying to impose their morals or culture upon us. They impose their brand of diversity thinking. I think it too kills creativity, individuality and most of all trust.

Provide three reasons, pro or con, for your thesis. Do not use tradition, upbringing, or authority as reasons. Use Evidence and arguments. God exists because we have the idea of God. Aristotle had the idea of substance, or matter. In the book, \u201cDesigner Universe\u201d, authors Davis and Poe use the example of an apple and say that, \u201cAn apple has substance, but our idea of the apple does not.\u201d I think that we have an idea that there is a God. Different cultures or religions have defined God in various ways, and defining God\u2019s substance is difficult. I think man\u2019s idea of God shows that he/she/it exists. I think the intelligent design argument for the existence of God is valid. It is difficult to study sciences and not wonder if there is an intelligence that created our universe. Life is shown to be perfectly balanced. We see this balance in our food chain and earth system and processes. The science of chemistry can reveal to us the proportion of elements that make up life, and one can\u2019t help but see that if the proportion was out of balance, life might cease to exist. There appears to be a perfection or purpose of design when we break down matter into its simplest forms that implies an intelligent God planned it all. The cosmological argument for God\u2019s existence is one I can believe. I think God\u2019s energy created the universe and put it into motion. I think of God as a potential energy and that energy was applied to a form. The kinetic energy was motion, life began from the energy. Maybe this is the big bang idea? On the question of evil, I think man has elements of both good and evil. We all have seen even the best of persons take a fall that shocks us, and we realize that everyone has good and bad tendencies. Many religions acknowledge a good and bad, for example, the Hindu religion has a God named Shiva that is seen to have the negative or evil personality. It is obvious that evil is here to stay with us on earth and came from somewhere. What if there were no evil, no struggle, no tragedy, or death? The human spirit seems to instinctively want some kind of triumph over evil or imbalance. Just as a chemical compound strives to reach equilibrium, I think good and evil have a balance or at least a relationship. I think that how man handles the evil that comes to him may be his ultimate purpose. When evil comes in does it destroy us or strengthen us? If there is a God and a Devil such as in the book of Job, maybe god is saying he/she \u201ctrusts\u201d his/her creation to make the right choices when evil comes.

I took Grandma to safeway with me as i was purchasing my ingredients to make her some lasagne (recipe on my site, but hers did not have wine in it). She said Jim liked lasagne, but not spaghetti. (It turned out I made a huge dish and a small one for the freezer.........and no, Jim does not like it). Grandma will be eating it for a while, haha. Grandma looked at the vegetables and fruits and everything in the store. I had her help me pick out a bell pepper. She was shocked at the price of lemons 2 for $1.00. I was shocked at safeway prices up there. Well, we got home and were starving, so she and I had a cheese omelete and french bread toast.

However, if there is a problem with your account, for example\u2026THE MONEY ISN\u2019T THERE, then please, don\u2019t suggest that WE did something with it. I can assure you, we did not. Secondly, don\u2019t come and ask us for refunds on your own mistakes. If you have a hundred dollars and you spend two hundred, YES you will receive a fee. Think of it this way, the bank is lending you money for being A. Stupid B. un-mathematical and C. irresponsible. They are also covering your ass by paying that business what you owed them, without having the \u201creturned check\u201d charges businesses will hit you with in addition to overdrawn account fees. Thank the bank for doing that for you\u2026IT\u2019S A BIG FAVOR. Thirdly, if you open an account in which you receive special privileges for maintaining certain balances, please don\u2019t come in complaining that you received a small fee for falling below those balances. Understand that the privileges received in those \u201cspecial\u201d plans are NOT given to the people who have the regular checking accounts and don\u2019t receive those fees. OH, and if you\u2019re in one of those \u201cspecial\u201d plans because loans are a part of your combined balances, do not\u2026I REPEAT\u2026do not come in and act high and mighty to the tellers because you are in the \u201cmost special of all the plans\u201d because we know your game, you own more than your life is worth. Fourthly, don\u2019t question the tellers as to the jobs they are doing. If they are slow, or confused, that is one thing\u2026but if we ask you to sign the check, or that we can\u2019t cash it because the date on it is three years ahead of the present date, we are doing our jobs. Doing anything else would result in our termination\u2026and if we are working as a teller, then we pretty much need our money DAMN bad\u2026so let us do what we are there for. Fifthly, swearing at us will get you nowhere. NO, I don\u2019t care if you \u201cfucking wipe your ass\u201d with your check, I\u2019m not going to cash it\u2026and after that I\u2019m pretty sure no one else will either. NO, I don\u2019t care who your mommy and daddy are, if YOUR account is overdrawn, mommy and daddy probably want nothing to do with it. If they do, that\u2019s their fault and you\u2019re a spoiled brat. NO, I will not fill out all of your paperwork, add up your checks and then figure out how much money you need for the weekend. That is your job, you should be able to figure out your money situation. We are there to hurry through transactions and get to the next person in line. Last...and definitely not least, PLEASE don't throw your college education, your masters, your doctorate, your WHATEVER in our faces, and then NOT understand why your deposit is screwed up due to YOUR failure at filling out a deposit slip. It's a simple task, it shouldn't take more than one time after being shown how to do it to fill it out correctly. A lot of us bank tellers are college/grad students working our way through, and thinking to ourselves \"THANK GOD I'm getting an education, and the common sense of filling out a simple deposit slip\". If you don't know how to do it, just ask, most of us love to show you how to do it, assuming that you'll remember the next time you come in. I am not a bitch. Well, I am kind of a bitch, but that's because of situations mentioned in the above commentary. I believe that all people should take the time to work in some sort of service industry....bank tellers, waiters/waitresses, retail..etc, just to see how HORRIBLE people can truly be. If ALL people were made to work, or at least try out a service position, I think that the world would be a better place because there would be a lot less assholes bringing workers to tears due to common everyday mistakes and problems. I think that people would be a lot more understanding of the difficulty of the jobs of the people that service them on a daily basis and that hopefully those assholes would discontinue being, well, assholes. This is in no way ignorant of the lazy bank teller that sits and picks at her nails, or checks his baseball scores on the internet, or pretends to be on the phone when there is a line out the door. I hate those tellers too...in fact, those tellers should be made to see what it's like to stand in a god-awful 10 person line and watch the people behind the counters mess around. What goes around comes around people. Keep that in mind next time you bitch out the teller (waiter/waitress/attendant/clerk) who wants to be there as little as you do. Tip well, smile, and be kind. It's not that hard...even if it's a stretch.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Have you ever had an argument that you believe to be very interesting, and try as you might, anytime you try to argue for that thing that you believe so greatly in, no one cares? I've decided to present that argument as my first entry into this new world of blogging. Sad love songs. I hate them, and I love them. I can listen to them no matter what the mood I am in. Does this make me sappy? Possibly, but I'm down with that. One song, that will bring me to tears everytime I hear it, is \"Can't Make You Love Me\" by Bonnie Raitt (forgive me if this isn't the original singer of the song, but it is the version I've always heard). The lyrics are incredibly simple, let me break them down: Turn down the lights, turn down the bed Turn down these voices inside my head Lay down with me, tell me no lies Just hold me close, don't patronize - don't patronize me First time listeners can handle these lines just fine. Sure the patronizing part stinks a little bit, but like I said, until we know what comes next, we can all stomach these lines just fine. Cause I can't make you love me if you don't You can't make your heart feel something it won't Here in the dark, in these lonely hours I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power But you won't, no you won't Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't WOW. I mean come on. Complete dejection, but with dignity. Unrequited love has a way of stinging so hard, Bonnie must know this cuz the way her voice sounds in this song makes me feel her pain. The speaker understands why his/her lover doesn't/can't/won't love back, but it makes it hurt nothing less. A heart is layed down, and the power of love is present for the speaker...but not for the lover. I'll close my eyes, then I won't see The love you don't feel when you're holding me Morning will come and I'll do what's right Just give me till then to give up this fight And I will give up this fight PHEW. Hiding from the situation makes it better only for the time being, only for the last time. One last taste of something so powerful, something that can't be acquired, and something that is going to be given up. The chorus is repeated, and here I go crying again. I don't believe that it takes the experience of not being loved in return to appreciate this song. I've listened to tons of sappy, sad love songs in my day, but this one takes the cake. Keep in mind, country music is not in my regular play lists, so I could have lots of disagreement based on the songs of broken down eighteen wheelers and lost dogs, but it is an interesting idea, none the less, to attempt to place one song as the saddest of all. Did VH1 do this on one of those countdown shows? Possibly, and I also understand that every song has its own way of cutting people in their own particular ways, but if I have to give an award...Bonnie, you've won it, cuz that song brings me to tears every SINGLE time I hear it. Ain't music wonderful?? So as I finish this posting, I realize that in the future I might change my mind. I will mark this time period by expressing that at this time (and for as long as I've known it) that this is the saddest song.

Maybe out of sadness...the psychologist in me thinks it might have been my desire to be in (a) the groom's shoes; Maybe not necessarily this groom in particular, but just because of what he _has_ ; what he experiences every time he sees her, talks to her, touches her. Because of HER. I very much want that experience to happen to me, yet at the same time, I did NOT want to be up there in front of all those people, staring, watching my every move.

I really don't have any complaints about them. The shit was on time, and no one fucked with me. Now the rental car co, this is a different story. I should have said something when I got the car, but I didn't cuz I'm stupid. The damn car had something fucked up with the steering. The steering wheel had to be offset for the car to go straight. Yeah, something was fucked up. When I brought it back, I told them about it, and the attendant (in all his infinate wisdom) decided it was because the front tires were bald. Hmm, well maybe that's because the front suspension is shot to hell, asshole! I fucking told them the steering was off, and it squeaked every time you turned...whatever...I'm not driving it anymore.

The point is, role playing is now easier and in my opinion more fun on a computer with great effects and multi-player and no dice rolling, although sometimes you still have to go old school just for the hell of it. My favorite computer game RPG so far is most definitely urlLink Neverwinter Nights . With two expansion packs out, you can be a player or a dungeon master, or create your own worlds with creatures and stories. Each expansion pack adds a little bit more onto the original story and then adds it's own epic adventure, as well as more creatures and settings. I am just absolutely in love with this game, and you don't need to be an RPG pro to play it. You can join groups online at the website to form a new kind of guild to play with other people.

Come on . Anyway, \"Chill\" is about a dorky high school guy who becomes cool by swallowing a \"squip\", a pill-sized \"super-computer\". The computer tells him how to dress, what to say, you know, how to be more chill . Yeah, I'm a little dubious but Amazon says it's \"searingly witty\" and \"suprisingly poignant\". All of Vezzini's urlLink Squip Central cluster of websites are obvious PR fabrication (yeah I know, I thought the butt skirts were real...) but I think the news byte about the Weitz Brothers (American Pie, About a Boy) signing on to make the film version is true.

My latest gadget is far from being fancy and the technology behind it won't wow anyone. It's so simple that I wonder why nobody hasn't come up with it sooner. I'm talking about my kitchen savior - the urlLink Dawn Power Dish Brush . I cook my own meal pretty often and am trying to cook \"healthy\" as mush as possible. Of course, that usually translates to grilling and not deep frying or any method with lots of oil involved. And that, my friend, tends to leave you with a very nasty rough stubborn stain behind to clean up and ruin your hands and nails in the process... as if dish washing hasn't done its fair share already. You would think that when you decide (against your better judgment) to spend the money on decent cookwares instead of your months-long, lusting after, wishlisty gadget, the least your investment could do for you is to *not* add more work to the work amount it's supposed to reduce. The last time I made my favorite recipe, grilled lemongrass chicken, it took me three days before I could get rid of all the burnt bits and pieces off the so-called nonstick pan. I scrubbed with the sponge. I left hot water in the pan overnight. I boiled vinegarsolution in it -- pretty much anything I could think of. Three friggin days of periodically checking in to the kitchen to see whether the stain has \"softened up\". Suffice to say, I haven't grilled any lemongrass chicken since. Then I stumbled upon my knight in a shiny, white (albeit plastic) armor in the cleaning solution aisle one day. It was the last one left on a rather new display that made it kinda stand out. At close inspection, the Dawn Power dish brush is a foot-long stick similar to that of a stick blender, with a rubber button and a replaceable brush head, and runs on batteries (4 AAs) -- sort of like an electric toothbrush for the kitchen. I love my Braun electric toothbrush, so the Dawn brush really appealed to me. My only concern at the time was that the battery-powered brush might not possess enough vigor to fight the seemingly immovable stain foe. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a try anyway since the price was reasonable enough ($8.xx). As an insurance, I also bought urlLink Dawn Power Dissolver . Just in case. Next stop... poultry section! Can't try the brush without the stain now, can I? As it turned out, I didn't even need the DPD -- though I have to say it was a nice added bonus. The brush worked wonderfully with just warm water and the dish washing detergent. Extra pressure was needed here and there, but overall it got the job done in under a minute. Now I'm impressed! These days I use the DPB exclusively for the pots, pans, and the acrylic cutting board. I found that it also works well in scrubbing off the label glue that was left behind on the surface without leaving any scratching mark, too. So far after a week of daily use, the brush is still going strong. I have yet to see how long the batteries last, but I estimate that it should last for a while.

Been thinking about a lot lately, so this might seem to be pretty random. Things are changing all around, but I don't really think any of it is really going to make much of a difference. Out with the old, in with the new. New managers to work with at work. New owners to work with at work. Everything is new at work, except for me and what I do. Show up, talk to agents, managers, publicists, local bands, local press, etc. Book shows, promote shows, settle shows. It's almost getting to a point where I feel like I am going through the motions. I don't get as excited as I used to about bands. I'm probably just a lit bit jaded, but I hate booking shows like W.A.S.P., and ICP and all that other crap. At least by booking these shows, I get the resources to book the bands that I like. Just take the good with the bad. About to be an uncle for the first time. Pretty excited about that, but I'm kind of scared for my sister. I just hope that she and her boyfriend are able to raise the baby together. I think it would crush her if he ends up leaving. I know that it will all work out in the end, but I have a feeling that it might be kind of a rocky road. Been thinking about life and love a little bit too much lately. I really miss what it's like to be in a relationship with someone. It's been two years now, and I still find myself thinking about the good times I had with Colleen from time to time. It's not that I miss her, I think I just miss the idea of having someone like her to have around. It's nice to be able to see someone everyday and not get sick of them. Someone with whom I can share my thoughts and feelings. On a similar note, I think it's time that I start taking care of myself a little bit more. I know that with my personality, I will always want to go out and have a good time. In turn, I think it's time I get off my ass and start trying to be healthier. Thinking about giving up meat again.

Soon there shall be a senti stuff to be posted tonight. Staying at office again late night. :( So here it is Ruth went to her mail box and there was only one letter. She picked it up and looked at it before opening, but then she looked at the envelope again. There was no stamp, no postmark, only her name and address . She read the letter: Dear Ruth: I`m going to be in your neighborhood Saturday afternoon and I'd like to stop by for a visit. Love Always, Jesus Her hands were shaking as she placed the letter on the table. \"Why would the Lord want to visit me? I'm nobody special. I don't have anything to offer.\" With that thought, Ruth remembered her empty kitchen cabinets. \"Oh my goodness, I really don't have anything to offer. I'll have to run down to the store and buy something for dinner.\" She reached for her purse and counted out its contents. Five dollars and forty cents. \"Well, I can get some bread and cold cuts, at least.\" She threw on her coat and hurried out the door. A loaf of French bread, a half-pound of sliced turkey, and a carton of milk...leaving Ruth with grand total twelve cents to last her until Monday. Nonetheless, she felt good as she headed home, her meager offerings tucked under her arm. \"Hey lady, can you help us, lady?\" Ruth had been so absorbed in her dinner plans, she hadn't even noticed two figures huddled in the alleyway. A man and a woman, both of them dressed in little more than rags \"Look lady, I ain't got a job, ya know, and my wife and I have been living out here on the street, and, well, now it's getting cold and we're getting kinda hungry and, well, if you could help us. Lady, we'd really appreciate it.\" Ruth looked at them both. They were dirty, they smelled bad and frankly, she was certain that they could get some kind of work if they really wanted to. \"Sir, I'd like to help you, but I'm a poor woman myself. All I have is a few cold cuts and some bread, and I'm having an important guest for dinner tonight and I was planning on serving that to Him.\" \"Yeah, well, okay lady, I understand. Thanks anyway..\" The man put his arm around the woman's shoulders, turned and headed back into the alley. As she watched them leave, Ruth felt a familiar twinge in her heart. \"Sir, wait!\" The couple stopped and turned as she ran down the alley after them. \"Look, why don't you take this food. I'll figure out something else to serve my guest.\" She handed the man her grocery bag. \"Thank you lady. Thank you very much!\" \"Yes, thank you!\" It was the man's wife, and Ruth could see now that she was shivering. \"You know, I've got another coat at home. Here, why don't you take this one.\" Ruth unbuttoned her jacket and slipped it over the woman's shoulders. Then smiling, she turned and walked back to the street...without her coat and with nothing to serve her guest. \"Thank you lady! Thank you very much!\" Ruth was chilled by the time she reached her front door, and worried too. The Lord was coming to visit and she didn't have anything to offer Him. She fumbled through her purse for the door key. But as she did, she noticed another envelope in her mailbox. \"That's odd. The mailman doesn't usually come twice in one day.\" She took the envelope out of the box and opened it. Dear Ruth: It was so good to see you again. Thank you for the lovely meal. And thank you, too, for the beautiful coat.

I started using blogs in my class last fall as a way for the class to discuss class readings. Blogs are a great learning tool it seems to me. They are asynchronous (what does THAT mean?) so we can blog at any time. I live in a farmhouse in central Iowa and teach at MSU in Mankato, Minnesota. I have two sons. My wife is deceased. I am a soccer referee, marathon runner (20 so far), and I studied at Iowa State for my Ph.D. Based on my experience so far teaching online--it's a completely different pedagogical situation from teaching face-to-face.

It\u2019s not that I think they are bad, I just usually don\u2019t choose to deal with people unless it is face to face or unless it is someone I have already met. I think that technical communications is a way of expressing your idea\u2019s in a very detailed and explicate way. I used to think that it was only about actual technical topics. After reading the first few chapters in the book I figured it must be any form of professional communication, regardless of occupation. My career goals are on the fence right now. I had made my mind up to be a software designer/programmer when I left the military. My first technical job since being discharged was at KEYC Channel 12 here in Mankato. I have come to think that I may stay in TV and just move up to a bigger TV station. My main career goals are to be in a technical field and make lots of money. Life\u2019s not as much fun without money. I know, I\u2019ve been on both ends of the cash cow. I haven\u2019t taken any kind of online courses before. I didn\u2019t realize until my second year at MSU that that was even an option. I took this course because it fit into my summer schedule and is required by my major, CIS. Being an online course is just a coincidence. I do like the fact that I can spend less time running to campus to attend a class.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Wade Kahout 05/26/04 ENG 271 My Introduction Hi, my name is Wade Kahout, I am a senior at MSU majoring in AET. I am originally from Olivia, MN. I have never \"blogged\" before and quite frankly wasn't familiar with the concept until recently. Im not totally clear on the exact definition of technical communication, however from what I gather techcomm is taking some scientific gibberish and translate it to the level of technicality of the intended audience. I have taken classes in the past that involved taking a quiz or two online or homework that was posted on the professors URL. As for career plans, I plan to graduate from MSU in spring '05 and get a R D job at a major auto company. I took this class because i need it for my major and i enjoy the convenience of taking the class from home.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Tonight we'll be having an optional meeting in Armstrong Hall.

Shreck is very cool although I think they should stay being human at the end as living as an ogre can not be all that good and probably isn't all that happy and they are meant to be living happily ever after. I guess they want the moral of the story to be 'no matter how ugly you are, you still have a chance of finding true love', however it comes across as 'people like you more if you're pretty so if you want to marry an ogre be prepared for people not liking you'?! What is strange about the film though, is that at the end of Shreck 1 they were all ready to live happily ever after and they went off on their honeymoon with everyone liking them. Yet, when they return home, in Shreck 2 everyone, seems to have forgotten this and they don't like them anymore. Oh well, not all of us can be as intelligent as me! Mmmm...what to write about now? The book I'm reading? It's very...graphic! I'm sure people, like myself, should not be exposed to this kind of...adult behaviour!

It does happen occasionly but it is very rare! In saying that, I did go out last friday night. I went sailing down the Seine! (hehe, it sounds sooo posh) Well it wasn't really sailing more kind of boating in a large boat with millions of people but suprisingly not too many Japanese tourists (not that I'm complaining about them to much but if I had wanted too meet some Japanese tourists I would have gone to Japan! As I told Lynne, 'that is where most of them like to hang out!') Oh well, I only went out then as I was on holidaybut these little outings are not regular occurances. Maybe I could get a hobby. Stamp collecting? No. Not even I would stoop that low. I could try doing some exercise but it rains too much in this country to even imagine going outside and anyway my parents would think of it as some sort of joke. When I told my mother my shoulder hurt the other day she told me it was because of my lack of exercise and I should try and move a bit further than up to my bed and too the fridge. That's parenting for you! Anyway, I think i have written way too much and I have probably written things that are classed as racist and parentist and I have also complained about my friends! Oh dear.

My mum drove past them yesterday and said 'do they want to be burnt down?'. You can tell she doesn't really like the welsh but it is true. Some people round here don't like the welsh so it's not a good idea to advertise that you are welsh by putting flags up around your caravan.

It's really odd. I've always thought they were very different people but I never thought this would happen. They're going to have to sell the house and everything. This is sooo weird. You don't expect this type of thing to happen. I mean, whats going to happen to them all. Okay, so it's not the end of the world, but I'm sure it feels that way for the kids. Anyway, it's something to think about. How would I feel if that happened to my parents? Mmmm...life is perculiar. I feel as though I should do something but I know that's stupid. I have a headache. Too much stuff is going on at the mo. I can't even attempt at at a funny comment. Sorry...\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Happy, happy, happy! I don't know why.

Mr Shakespeare, Mr Blake, Roald Dahl, stand aside, poetry genius coming through! Well, maybe I still need a bit of practice. It is all true, though. About the sun and that. Mmmm...any stories to tell? I know, I believe I have farmers genes (that's genes as in chromosome type things not, as my mother thought, farmers jeans, when I told her) I went to the allotment yesterday and picked peas and beans and ate a few strawberries too. I was stung by a nettle and scratched by planks of wood (very rural stuff). When we got home me and mum popped the pea and bean pods. I believe I have pea popping genes (now that would be funny if they were pea popping jeans!). Anyway, I only have one other story, I think. Yesterday night, around 11pm, I was watching TV in the living room and happened to look out the window (that wasn't the story, just the build up) the security light came on outside the Toman's house and this person was walking around looking around the bins, at the door and then started waving this big stick in the air. At first I had a funny feeling that it could have been a burglar but then I thought only a very stupid burglar would wave a huge stick around in the air. Mum opened the window and shouted out to it. Then a large afro appeared, closely followed by James. He had got home without a key and no-one was in so he thought he would amuse himself with a large stick. Oh well, not everyone can be a genius. I might go shopping tomorrow unless it's hot, then I won't go shopping tomorrow. I'll write soon. I won't leave you with another 'mind bending' question as I seem to have run out of them...For now!\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "today ish thEe aNniverSary oF ycS..` aT firST qUitE borIng lA honesTLi saYInG..` but duRing aNd afftER thE teLemATch becaME daMn hiGh..` teLematCh we plaYed caPtaiN's baLl..` fiNd thE swEet in thE flouR aND.... waTERBOMBS!!! haHas~ sHoO weT..! deN cleaN uP gO baCk tO musIC roOm deN gt praIse anD worshiP..` huG heRe huG theRE..` deN dInnER tIMe..! gT cHicKEn drUMsticK..` veGe..` freNCh fries..`` *yuM yUm* hEhs~ den iT was thE \"ycS idOl\" timE..sHOo moIi anD yvOnnE saNG jaY's qINg tiAn..` dUnno sINg likE Wad deN whilE jennY weRE critisIng uS, i waS likE..rollinG on thE flooR luFFin..lols~ ok deN deY annoUNcED thE wInnerS whu Were aBLe tO mAKe tO thE fINaLS aND shOO sUrprIsinlI moIi aND yvONne gT in lO..` deN aftEr daT gO homE lo waD elSe..` sHoo daRK..!

To begin. Tonight began as a night like any other in the summer. Hot, humid and, as always, at Noah's house. There, at Noah's, the Super Friends of Arlington gathered. Jeremy, Paul, Eric and later Siping. With our Super Friends Travis and Chris abroad, we were forced to defeat Mega Stan and Queen Juliet's food of doom. Jeremy singlehandedly defeated four burgers, three hotdogs and countless chicken wings. Paul overpowered at least ten unsuspecting chicken wings. Noah and I ate a burger and three wings each because we, uh, were saving room for desert. Yeah, thats it. Desert. Anyway. Moving on to Robbin's Farm, we encountered hordes of pre-pubescent teens trying to fight. We had brought a bag of cherries with us, which for some reason caused some giggly little shits to act like they new us. Damn. Glowsticks were for sale so naturally I bought two. At dark, we settled on suicide hill until the fire works. We made fun of people and Siping, while kids from our school thought it would be fun to start a shaving cream fight with the six of them. Silly kids, shaving cream is for riots and fun stuff, not the fireworks! We heard another gaggle of people behind us that we knew wishing they had glowsticks. Every time the would-be-rioters dropped a glowstick, we threw it to the gaggle. This was fun for a while, but it got old. Then, just as we contemplated our swift departure, we noticed a pair of glowsticks caught in a tree. The only option we had was to retrieve those glowing strands of bliss. Jeremy, Siping, and I set out with sticks and rocks to hurl at the glowsticks while the growing crowd held it's collective breath. After Jeremy threw a root from a small tree he pulled out of the ground, he broke the small plastic connection holding the glowing ring in place. To our surprise, the crowd began to cheer. Then after like three seconds it stopped and we became normal people who no one cared about again. Other highlights; Jeremy tackling Tom Fitz when Tom was being stupid; Me yelling at some fat, balding 30 year old loser with a laser pointer; and the fireworks ending so we could leave. Overall a good night, which should end very soon with me falling peacefully asleep in my Air Conditioned room. BTW: I am the official Word-Smithy; a smith of words.

I went to the Bahamas, met some kick ass Bahamians, and went to Fepcot. That is one sweet trip you might say. YES! (Horray for accents edition!) Thursday, 2/12 Went to the airport, got in the plane. USAIR flight 9021whothefuckcares0. Friday, 2/13 Today really was fun. We went to bed at about 1:00 in the AM, so I was a little sleepy after a day of travel. We traveled via PEGAUS! bus lines to Port Canaveral. On the way, we met Dennis, our cruise director. When we arrived at the boat, I was pretty amazed by its size. 3 football fields long (Duh, 100 yards x 3), featured a rock wall to climb, probably a dozen bars, lounges and entertainment places (though few band members were thoroughly entertained here). We got these cool little cards to put money on, credit card style. A few people I was with figured that the cruise line uses them to keep us from knowing how much we spend on Pina Coladas. Before we got on the boat, they took our picture so when our card got scanned they knew it was us. Annoying and cool! For a boat 3 fb fields long, you'd think the rooms would be vast. If you do think this, however, you are mistaken. The room was 7' x 7'. The bathroom was 4.5' x 2'. The shower was shitty, because drying required a degree in Kama Sutra. It also smelled in there, because they used sea water for the toilet. The same goes for the pool, which, I was told, used sea water. I decided not to use the pool because there were too many mullet-wearing rednecks on board with hairy, fat stomachs. We ran through a drill on getting to our \"muster stations\". I learned how to use the life-vest's clippy things that is on just about, oh say, EVERY FUCKING PIECE OF CLOTHING. The loud-speaker lady invited us to a \"pahtehy\". I translated her ridiculous aussie accent to mean there was some sort of merriment going down on the poop deck. I skipped it. We ate lots of food. Saturday, 2/14 The boat landed in Nassau in the mid-morn. \"This is you captain, Captain Grimstad. We have arrived in Nasshau. (this was said extremely fast. try it. it's fun!) The temperature in Nasshau is a balmy *aetie-two deegrees forenhite*.\" We repeated this over and over. At least until we set foot on the island, where we got a quote never to be forgotten. This came from a rotund Bahamian woman, just outside of the building tourists had to pass through. She was trying to get us to take a bus tour through the city. \"Be amazed by steeng rays, monta raes, eegle raeys, shaaks, and ova fowtee thousand varieties of tropeecal feesh! See whea the reech leeve, ahnd whea the poors live!\" We didn't go on the bus. The idea of shaaks didn't sound fun. We did manage to work our way over to the public beach. Dan, Guy, Gorch, and I swam for a good 25 minutes. From the water, I was sure no one would try to hustle me. I could see Issac being tricked into buying the same puca shell neclace for $10 that every stand in the market had for 3/$1. All of a sudden... \"Do you want to go to da white wall, mon?\" (what the fuck is wrong with those people? do they think they are Jamaican?) \"Uhh, huh?\" (from another swimmer) \"I don't think they have enough balls to go to da white wall, mon!\" I looked around and realized the white wall was a piece of formed cement that people were jumping off of. This guy was actually trying to hustle me into taking me to a public WALL to jump! I didn't go, but realize now that jumping from that wall would have been a life changing experience. We shopped around, I got some goods. You know what I mean. We returned to the boat after only a few short but memorable hours on the island of Nasshau. Sunday, 2/15 This day was weird. We played for Dennis, who we were learning more and more about. Not only was he our cruise director, but he held equipment in his room, arranged for instruments and a concert on-deck, is the president of the company, and arranges to have about 90 other bands sail yearly. Damn. We earned \"superior\", out of a possible \"good\", \"excellent\", and \"superior\". I even got a sweet trophy for \"Outstanding Soloist\". We spent much of the day on the cruise line's private island. The pronunciation is still being hotly debated. Dennis said that even though it is spelled \"Cococay,\" it is actually pronounced \"Coco-key\". Everyone on the boat, including our captain, Captain Grimstad, pronounced it \"Coco-kay\". The island was a little too perfect - you know. Man-made-esque. I had no problem with that though. I swam in the crystal blue waters for 4 hours. I think I heard it was snowing in Boston that day. Suckas. When we returned to the boat, a \"Weather System\" was moving in. We played for a few boat riders, but the wind almost stymied our efforts. Monday, 2/16 Our hotel had some computer problem so we stayed outside by the hot tub soaking our feet. It was really nice sitting with a dozen friends in the Floridian sun. We cracked jokes. Fun. We went to the Hard-Rock Cafe in (announcer style voice) Universalstudiosorlandoflorida. The food was \"eh\", and when they say hard rock, they mean Yanni. I didn't get to ride any rides due to time constraints, but I had a great time going in the stores and listening to performers. I bought a NASCAR cafe hat here for only $5. Tuesday, 2/17 On this day, we visited Epcot, or as jazz band members called it, \"Fepcot.\" The food here was really great. It was also in abundance. Ten points for D-nizzle. The problem with this park is the lack of fast shit. I went on that \"amazing\" and \"realistic\" mission to Mars ride. Maybe if you were on acid or something.

Hey all you (five) dedicated look-atters of my blog. Sorry for such infrequent updates, but I've been busy. I'll make this a real winner. This week was far from being \"da-bomb\". On Sunday night, I fell asleep _very_late_. I woke up on time, got ready on time, and even got to school early. Problem was, I forgot my Concerta, the thing that makes my day go by. Some of you might have noticed me falling asleep, drooling, or staring into space. I apologize for that. The clincher for Monday: I got a thesis paper assignment. 7-8 pages (double spaced; thank you Microsoft for the one thing you actually did right) about gothic horror. Now, I'm not typically one to whine about long assignments, usually owing to their far away due dates. My english teacher decided that two and a half weeks would be plenty of time for this sucker. After all, we do have the whole vacation to work on that, right. Pfft. The rest of the week went a little better, mostly because I remembered my Concerta. I should give some of it to all my friends, so if I ever forget it, they can all just give me some. \"Eric, you aren't paying attention today. Are you okay?\" \"Just gimme a few red caps. I think I'll manage if you just help me out.\" This week is going to suck. I can feel the finger looming about the giant vacuum switch. It will only be a three day + three period week, but that makes it just that much harder. You see, my fellow students, I will be traveling to the Bahamas on Thursday. I know, I know. Don't think I have forsaken you. If you give me a dollar, I'll even buy you a trinket; two dollars, and I'll buy you some booze. Psyche! I'll be back on Wednesday in the middle of the vacation, so I can have a shindig with some of you poor folks. I will also be missing the yearly School street tradition we call \"Squash Drop\".

Travis gave me a summary of his and if it fought mine in a cage match, mine would have come out with less balls. So then Friday rolls around. The day I had been waiting for. All week I thought about Friday. True relaxation came. I went to Travis's with Noah and played Halo. Scores were T-25 E-8 N-6 then T-25 E-7 N-7. But really, I wasn't trying. At about five, Jeremy, Farid, and Liz came over and we went out to Anna's Taqoria (sp?). Farid backed his car into a cement wall and dislodged his rear bumper. Fortunately, he had a roll of duct-tape. Jeremy and Farid were going to try and tape that shit on the wrong way. Then I came out of left field all MacGyver style and was like, \"No, you don't have enough paper clips. Get me a piece of paper, a tooth pick, and a match, and I'll fix it.\" They went off to get it, and I just taped it on. They came back and they were all, \"Do you still need all this shit?\" So we start driving off and Travis and Liz decide to flip the bizzle to these college kids from the way back seat. One of them freaks out and Farid goes all James Bond on us and drives like he's the man. He swerves through cars in the parking lot, T and L screaming \"Oh, shizzle my nizzle! That white fellow is gonna catch us! Floor it Jam- Farid!\" We made it to Mass ave from the P-lot and as we drove away, we saw that stupid white kid flash us the \"Westside\" sign. Both hands, actually. I'm surprised he could manage such a complex motor function. He had, after all, just chased a bunch of stupid high school kids for giving him the mid-f.

He could have said this: \"High numbered, heavy elements like Uranium can't hold their 235 electrons very well. The electrons are spinning very fast. The outer most electrons are not as close to the center as the others are and therefore do not receive as much pull from the protons in the nucleus.\" Instead, he chose to treat us like we were stupid. \"Unstable atoms are like urlLink Michelle Kwan ,\" he started, producing mild giggling. \"No, no! Just listen! When she is spinning really fast, she puts her arms really close to the inside, and she doesn't fall over. Just like an atom, right?\" At this point, the wiener looked at us, smiling. Like a big dumb dog. \"But then when she, uh, you know, opens her arms, she slows down and, uh, moves lower to the ground...\" Just like an atom, huh? Another time, he was trying to explain the electron shell levels of atoms. He started off in the same stupid way, attempting to form an analogy that was completely... well... retarded. \"Electrons can't just jump from shell to shell, okay?\" Most of us knew this, but those who didn't were stoned anyway. \"It's just like how you can't jump from the bottom set of stairs to the top-\" This is where I jumped in - Kali you might remember this. \"Siping could!\" \"No, he couldn't,\" Mr. Mahoney tried to recover.

Quickly, team Dramstad-Noble rushed to their science teacher in search of a space ship he might have hanging around. Kali refused to die, and Eric was a tag along. Dennis Mahoney happened to have one slightly used spaceship and gladly gave it to them, unaware that the Earth was going to explode in few days time. Kali and Eric scoured their city to find necessary supplies for the trip. They collected a pair of space suits with replacements as well as pants, drills, fuel, solar panel equipment, rope, dirt, seeds, water, growing lights and other necessary elements for a garden, rabbits, chickens and a coop, goats, a greenhouse kit, food, water and a filtration system, feed for animals, a vacuum cleaner, air filtration system, two Segway scooters, many other clothing items and tools. The animals also had sleep chambers specially sized and shaped for them, made out of sticks and gum. Once they had obtained their supplies, team Dramstad-Noble packed them into the cargo hold of the ship and they were ready to go. Before boarding, Kali and Eric took one last breath of fresh air and then started the ship. As the rockets fired up, a deep rumble came from the ground. They realized it was minutes before the explosion. They lifted off immediately. When they were passing the moon, the Earth came to its dramatic end. Even from the space ship Eric and Kali could see the Earth shake. Then the shaking just stopped. For an entire minute, the Earth stood still \u2013 or so it seemed. They saw huge waves, some as large as Africa moving from the center of the ocean. In just seconds the continents were obliterated. Soon the whole planet was shaking again and lava spewed from underwater cracks. Then it exploded. Exactly like the Death Star. With John Williams music. As much as Eric and Kali wanted to cry, they couldn\u2019t. All that they could do was set the ship on autopilot and climb into their specially sized sleep chambers. One was extra small and one was extra large. * * * Six months later * * * The trip went perfectly to plan. The ship woke them up when it had landed on the pre-determined site - only a few miles from Mars\u2019 polar ice caps. Kali and Eric quickly set to work. They threw on clean clothing and went to the cargo hold. The animals seemed fine. They hadn\u2019t been taken out of their chambers and wouldn\u2019t be for a few days. Their first task was to build and secure the greenhouse, as it would be their main source of food, air, living space and animal area. They had bought a special sealant that held air in and the thin carbon dioxide atmosphere out. Carrying the parts of the greenhouse on their Segway scooters, they slowly finished it, working day and night. It was easily assembled, but the sealant was extremely hard to apply because it wouldn\u2019t stick to the metal and glass in the lower gravity. Eventually they found that by applying sealant to some parts on the gravity controlled ship, it went on much better than outside. Because plants need carbon dioxide to live, the plants could easily start inside the green house that was full of Martian air. When the plants began growing, they would take in the carbon dioxide and give off breathable air for the settlers to breathe. None of this would be possible until the solar array was in place to power the grow lights and re-charge the Segway batteries. * * * Two Weeks Later * * * The solar arrays were in place. The plants were started and growing nicely. The tools were stored inside of the green house along with the food and feed. The animals were free to roam around inside of the cargo hold, but the male and female rabbis were separated until the travelers were ready to set up the cages for the new rabbits. Kali and Eric were able to use the cabin of the ship for living quarters, but didn\u2019t do much living. They had to make sure that the chickens were properly fed so that they could produce eggs. They had to make sure that the air hoses from the green house were hooked up to the ship so that the ship wouldn\u2019t run out of air. Going to the polar ice caps every day was extremely important, because if they didn\u2019t go, they would run out of water. The ice caps aren\u2019t pure ice but have some water in them. Eric and Kali rode the scooters several miles every day to the ice caps, drilled the ice into chunks, and returned them to the ship. The chunks had to be melted and filtered. There wasn\u2019t much yield though. After they got comfortable, they constructed the chicken coop and rabbit cages so that they animals weren\u2019t running along the floors of the cargo hold. The goats had only a little room so Eric and Kali were able to fabricate one suit for them so they could be taken outside for exercise. Eventually the entire spaceship could be split from the cargo hold and moved directly to the ground, making it more accessible. Harvesting plants in the greenhouse was an easy way to get food. The chickens produced good eggs and many healthy chicks. The rabbits had no trouble adjusting to the Martian lifestyle; plenty of little thumpers were running all over. The cargo hold had leftover greenhouse windows added to it so that the animals could have more natural lighting. The rabbits could produce quickly so they were an excellent source of meat. The chickens and goats weren\u2019t as bountiful, so they couldn\u2019t be used as a source of food quite yet. The goats could produce fertilizer, which proved useful in their garden. Martian life seems hard, but it would be a wonderful home. Kali and Eric will have to live the rest of their lives on milk, meat, eggs and vegetables.

Harry's dad was not in Slytherin and Harry is not the half blood prince however there are several confirmed facts about the book and here they are straight from A mix of Harry Potter Fansites. All have been Confirmed from god herself J.K. Rowling. (Warning if u like to know absolutelly nothing about the next bookDONT READ ON but these are very broad and most are to be assumed): Read on for more... 1. By the ends of books 6 and 7 \"you'll have all the back story you'll need\", says JK Rowling, and a prequel will not be necessary 2. There will be a new Minister of Magic, no more Mr. Fudge. 3. We will find out what happened to Hagrid's half brother Grawp. He will be a bit more controllable in book 6. 4. The Dursleys are in the next book, but Harry's stay with them will be the shortest yet. In book 5 he stayed for 4 weeks, so we know his stay will be less than 4 weeks. 5. Cho Chang will not be a romantic interest of Harry in Book 6, however there will be a \"little romance\" for Harry says JK. 6. In books 6 and 7 we will find out exactly why JK killed off Sirius. 7. Harry becomes even more powerful in book 6. 8. In books 6 and 7 we will find out why Dumbledore trusts Snape. 9. We will find out what happened to Wormtail AKA Peter Pettigrew 10. More about the animosity between Snape and Sirius will be revealed in the last 2 books. 11. JK has said that giving away the form of Snape's boggart and patronus says too much. We'll definitely find out what Snape's worst fear is, and it'll be important. 12. Hermione and Draco will NOT end up together in book 6 or 7. 13. We will find out what exactly Dudley saw when he looked at the dementors. 14. The reason Voldemort and Harry both didn't die when Voldemort tried to kill Harry, will be revealed. 15. We will see more of Draco's mother, Narcissa Malfoy, now that Lucius is busy. 16. We'll learn more about Harry's scar in the last 2 books. 17. Moaning Myrtle will make an appearance again, as will Tonks. 18. More about Voldemort's birth will be revealed, thus helping us understand why he is so evil. 19. Muggles begin to notice \"more and more odd\" occurrences in book 6, says JK. 20. The wizarding world is really at war in the sixth book. 21. Harry will tell his dearest friends about the prophesy after it sinks in to him. 22. We will learn more about Harry's relatives, including his grandparents (though JK says they aren't really important to the story) 23. We will find out what happened to Sirius's motorbike. 24. Book 6 will be shorter than the 5th book (or at least JK's 99% sure, but will not swear on her children's lives) 25. There will be no \"new\" nationalities of children at Hogwarts. Hogwarts is a British school, and JK says that adding foreigners for the sake of it is not in her plans. 26. During an interview, when JKR was asked in which Hogwarts room she'd like to be for 1 hour, she said it would be a room in which Harry has been before, but doesn't know its importance. Yet. (this could have happened in book 5, but we're unsure) 27. It's very important in the plot that Harry has his mother's eyes, and that her wand was very good for charms. 28. During an interview for Kids BBC, Victor Greensteet (reporter) asked Rowling if Harry would have a dragon for a pet. This is what she replied: \"You can't tame a dragon, no matter what Hagrid thinks. It's simply impossible. So no. He has more common sense. He MAY have a different pet in the future, but for now, I won't say anything else\". (This could have been buckbeak, but I'm sure we can expect more pets) 29. In the same interview for Kids BBC, the reporter asked J. K. if Harry had ever used the internet, and this is what she had to say: \"No. They (the Dursleys) won't let him go near Dudley's computer, and Dudley is the only one who has a computer. They hit him if he gets too near to the keyboard. So the answer would be No. I use it a lot, but Harry doesn't. Wizards don't really need to go on the web. They have an even better way to find out what's happening in the outside world, which I think is a lot more fun than the Internet, but I'm going to keep quiet on this one.\" 30. The choice between what's right and what's easy will be a pillar of the plot in Harry's last 2 years at Hogwarts 31. Harry's parents' profession will be a big part of the plot. 32. Something HUGE will be revealed about Lily Potter.

HE WAS EATING AN ICECREAM CONE. His wife, or \"lady\" as I expect he calls her, sat there with a plaid sleeveless shirt, up-doo and a big-ass icecream cone. The purpose of the PT Cruiser was to rekindle the passion teenagers had for funky, non-ricer cars during the surfer era. What it actually did was rekindle that same passion in the people that were actually alive during the surfer era.

It was my 4th time reading it and consideriding it is 870 its was still as magical the 4th time. Read on for more...

As several people know I love to theorize what is gonna happen in the next harry potter book and I usually am right. I will not ruin the story for u but I will say what I believe the title to mean. Harry Potter is obviously the half blood prince. His mother was a muggle and his father a wizard making him half blood, But a prince what does this mean u may say. Well I will tell u exactlly what it means. Harry is a member of the Gryffindor house because they display bravery. But there is more to Harry's link to this house then meets the eye. Harry is infact the Heir of Gordric Gryffindor one of the original founders of Hogwarts. This is hinted throughout the series as harry pulled a sword belonging to Gordric out of the sortingin the 2nd book while fighting the Basalisk. Dumbledor then told Harry that only a true member of the Gryffindor House could have done that. This is an obvious connection but another that I have found is in the first or second book im not sure which they mention harry's parents lived in Gordrics Hallow obviouslly named after Godric Gryffindor. This would make Harry a prince in a way. There is one curveball to this and it is the fact that Harry's father was in Slytherin.

The boy is the brother of a federal prosecutor involved in a case against Affleck's boss' boss, a guy from New York. Affleck succesfully kidnaps the boy, but somehow, his boss thinks he's a \"Fuckup\", so, to save the day, send Jennifer Lopez to help him. As one might expect, Affleck wants J Lo in the sack. In an incredible plot twist, Jenny-from-the-block turns out to be Jenny-who-hates-the-cock; she's a lesbian. For much of the movie, Jennifer uses big words that require long pauses inbetween, giving viewers the impression that the retarded kid is a better speaker. Not only does Jennifer pause quite often. An average of 3 awkward silences per minute confirms millions of people's suspicions: there were no editors, directors or even writers for this movie. The pauses are Benniffer's chance to regroup and come up with something new and stupid to say. I must say they are quite good at that. All in all, I'd probably agree with IMDB on the rating: 2.1/10.

My dad came home last night at 6:00, like he usually does. But last night, he came home with: 1. A new 10-inch subwoofer. 2. A new progressive scan DVD player. 3. A new 5.1 receiver. So I guess it was in December that we mounted 5 5-inch speakers in the wall and ran 30 feet of cable for each of them. This fact, coupled with the fact that we have never been good with speaker stuff, was the reason I stayed up until 1:00 hooking up our new surround sound equipment. There were so many fucking problems: 1. Wire would not stay in the reciever, which lead us to believe the speaker wire was damaged somewhere in the wall. This would have sucked because, you know, the wire was behind the wall. The real problem? I didn't push them into the sockets properly. 2. The subwoofer produced only feedback. The problem? I didn't correctly connect the fucking coax jack. That one took us at least an hour alone. 3. After a whole night of work, one speaker wouldn't come on. The solution? Popping the speaker off the wall and connecting a wire that had been loose by less than one milimeter. This was at least half an hour of work. And I was hungry. 4. A door to a crawl space fell off. I don't have any clue how a door, which I've successfully opened and closed hundreds of times, could just come off of one of its hinges. I blame ghosts. 5. I was tired. One of the most dangerous things I have done is work on major projects like this one while tired. Although the night was filled with feelings of anger, frustration, and sadness, it was finally filled with happiness.

I got to Travis's house about 5:00. We watched VH1 until at least 6:30, and left the house by 7:00 to pick up Kali and Mike. \"Sweet,\" I think. Both Kali and Mike are going to be able to come. On an ordinary friday, neither would be able to come. So, aside from Travis nearly popping a tire on the curb outside of Kali's house, picking the two of them up actually worked. AND we got to the movie theater. Early . What were we there to see? Napoleon Dynamite. This movie surpassed all expectations I had for it - which were considerably high. A must see.

By the way, if you're actually reading this and checking out my blog, you rock! I'm not sure who of you out there will do this, but I hope it's a fun way for those of you interested in my perception of a new culture to stay informed. That aside, let's get down to business! After a slow weekend start, Sunday rolled around and I wanted to go further into the city and explore some more. Nate and I had not gone and explored as a couple yet since we're constantly surrounded by our fellow volunteers who have quickly become new friends. Today was our only opportunity, so off we went... I'm not sure why, but until today I haven't really felt like a foreigner here. Pretty much everywhere you go, there is Chinese and English on the signage, and the majority of the people can speak English. However, wherever we were today, we were constantly reminded of our non-Chinese backgrounds. On a few of the crowded streets, Nate was definitely the only \"white guy\" and by far the tallest. It was the first time since being here that people were staring at us with confusion. Since this was my first experience with this in Hong Kong, I didn't really mind it. It humored me up actually. We found a Vegetarian restaurant (we somehow always manage to do this, don't we?!) and the server spoke to me in Cantonese the entire time. Even though Nate would reply back to her in English or attempt to speak Mandarin, she just kept talking to me. I found this rather strange since I clearly was not replying back. I just smiled awkwardly and kept looking at Nate for assistance. When our appetizer arrived, a beautiful shiny fork came with it - and it was clear that it was meant for Nate's usage. The crowded market areas we ventured into had what I pictured China to have: lots of fresh produce, hanging poultry and old men with no shirts smoking. It also had what I wasn't expecting: a kiosk just selling bras, fish and seafood practically jumping out of their shallow tanks onto the sidewalk, many 7-11 convenience stores, men butchering slabs of meat on tree stumps, and people burning things in tiny garbage cans. I smiled when a girl walked by with a tank top that read: \"I'm a mango girl.\" The random written English phrases on some of the clothing here is hilarious. I wonder if the Chinese characters on clothing in the USA is equally hilarious to Chinese people? Hmmmm...maybe my experience today was preparing me for what life is going to be like in China. Until today's adventure, I've been sheltered by being in very touristy areas of Hong Kong. Wherever we were today, were not so touristy and for that I'm thankful. I think I've been craving a more realistic experience of what it is like to be Asian-American in Asia. Perhaps if you check back in with me in the middle of January, I may not be so cheery about this, but then again, maybe I'll be fine.

I didn't know what to expect, but since the city I had been to with the most buildings was New York, I was picturing something along those lines...and I did see that but I saw what seemed like 4 or 5 New Yorks packed into one very dense space. It was mind boggling! At the airport, we managed to find Kevin, one of the coordinators with Maryknoll whom I have known since college. It was nice to have someone there to \"escort\" us to the Maryknoll house, in which we had no idea how to get to. Kevin got our train tickets and got us a taxi, and before you knew it we were seeing one of the largest cities in the world pass us by. Kevin commented that in Hong Kong, buildings go one way: UP! The Maryknoll house is very pleasant. It is located in perhaps the most \"posh\" area of Hong Kong. It's called the Stanley area, and most of the apartments in this area go for $5,000-$6,000/month - US dollars! There are a lot of fancy resorts around here, too. The outside of the house has a traditional East Asian architecture, while the inside feels very much like a nice college dormitory. We had arrived in time for lunch, so we joined the other volunteer teachers who had already arrived and began our first introductions. I was exhausted after not having slept at all on the plane and very little in the Incheon Airport, but when adrenaline wants to kick in, it does and I guess the human body can withstand anything. Some people wanted to go to the beach which is just a hop, skip and jump away, so after throwing our luggage down in our \"Newlywed Suite\" we changed into our bathing suits and joined the rest of the gang. The beach was very crowded as it was a Sunday and the sun was showing through the hazy sky every now and again. This was my first time swimming in ocean water, and wow was it salty! It felt great to be in the water and relax, but the bottom of the water was filled with rocks, rocks that made it very difficult to walk on. In fact, later when we all had returned to the Maryknoll house, we discovered that about half of us got some type of gash on the feet! I managed to avoid a gash, but Nate got a nice one on his right foot. After dinner Sunday evening, Nate and I went straight to bed. It was only about 8:00 pm here, but I knew I had to sleep. The next day we were to begin our orientation and training on becoming English teachers in China. Monday through Friday was filled with many lectures, activities and opportunities to gain as much information as we could so when we all headed for the mainland to our respective universities, we had some idea on what we were getting into. There were nearly 20 of us volunteers, 9 of whom were St. Ben's/St. John's graduates, and the rest from all over - Massachussetts, Illinois, Indiana, New York...getting to know everyone in the last week has felt a lot like freshmen college orientation. We have all commented on this feeling, but yet how we're in Hong Kong overlooking the sea, so it's definitely an idyllic setting. Most of the volunteers are younger than myself, having just graduated from college and being around 22. There are a few volunteers who are well over the age of 45, too. Those of us in the \"Under 26\" category have enjoyed livin' it up. Please feel free to use your imagination with this. I will admit I've had some expensive drinks here in Hong Kong ($4 shots, $6 beers). Maybe this is a good time to list some very basic observations of Hong Kong: It's a fairly expensive city - prices are pretty equivalent to any big city in the USA, and in some cases higher! There are McDonalds EVERYWHERE. As a group we've walked around and hummed the extremely irritating melody \"Ba-duh-duh-duh-daaaaa...I'm lovin' it!\" It is a very dense city. I can't believe how many people live in such close corners. The buildings at nighttime are gorgeous, far better than any night skyline I've ever seen in the USA - they light the buildings up in every color imaginable. There are definitely some sketchy bar areas loaded with prostitutes. The markets are packed and sell everything imaginable, but nothing so far that I've wanted badly enough to buy. I did see some cute Sesame Street figurines that I almost bought, but realized I really didn't need. The public transportation is great, but unfortunately the area that the Maryknoll house is in is on top of a hill and requires a very bumpy, windy ride down to get to where the action is. I've had motion sickness dozens of times since getting here. You see lots of European, Australian and USA folk around here - in some places it is easy to forget you're in Asia. There seem to be a lot of Indian restaurants and therefore people who live here. Restaurant employees hand out flyers and deals to sway you into eating at their restaurant. Some downright follow you and beg you to eat at their restaurant. This is one experience in which my Asian ethnicity came in handy. I didn't get nearly as many people asking me to buy stuff or eat at their restaurant as my Caucasian counterparts did. This city never sleeps. Bar time closings do not apply. I should know, last night a group of us were out past 3am and the bars were still hopping. Every street is bright and reminds me of Times Square in New York City. It truly is unbelievable. Well, we depart for the mainland this week. Perhaps when I'm more settled there, I can write more about my new experiences in China, which is sure to be quite different than Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a touristy city, and I can easily walk around and speak English without confusing the locals. On the mainland, I'm not quite so sure that will happen.

From Los Angeles, we boarded Korean Air and spent the next 12 hours of our life at 37,000 feet above the ocean so we could begin our journey in Asia. Nearly everyone on the airplane was a Korean-speaking person, so I confused the hell out of the flight attendants when I couldn't answer their questions in Korean. We had a 13 hour layover in Inchon's International Airport in Korea. Neither one of us slept much and sat awake between the hours of midnight and 5:00 AM in an eerily quiet airport...with the only sound being the custodial crew and the high-tech plasma televisions featuring Korean Olympians in various events. Finally, around 8:50 AM we boarded our airplane for another 3-4 hour flight to get to Hong Kong. Whew! What a journey!

Astrologers consider people whose birthdays fall between May 21 and June 21 to be born under the sun sign of Gemini.

According to astrologers, Geminis tend to be quick-witted, changeable, talkative, versatile, and sometimes crafty or mischievous, with strong communication skills. Geminis are known for their ability to express themselves, and are witty, clever, and often well-read. They usually have something to say about everything. Astrologers believe that typical Geminis have highly developed intellects, and that they place greater importance on learning than on emotional or practical issues. However, they consider Geminis to be so clever that they can give the impression of deep emotion or of the practicality of their desires. Astrologers believe Geminis have the ability, and often the need, to do more than one thing at a time. Geminis are so interested in everything that they get bored easily and often cannot resist moving on to the next subject, tendencies which can make them seem shallow and fickle. Professions associated with the sign Gemini include teaching, journalism, publishing, sales, and other professions that require verbal skills and flexibility.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Well boys and girls, this edition of Gayfag is written especially for little old rachie here, and I must say I\u2019m a little rusty, I haven\u2019t written for a few months.

Breathe out motherfucker, I don\u2019t need your appraisal your anticipation or even your remote interest. You will read what I have to say regardless. Because I am that damn cool. So what has interested me and fallen under the gaze of my oh so critical eye this month? Well if you must know, in my spare time when I should have been revising I was reading trashy tabloids and marvelling at the activities of the once so perfect David Beckham. Now before you roll your eyes and claim to have heard it before\u2026listen to me. This is not a piece about David and his fucking stick insect of a wife (fuck man I just wanna take her to KFC and shove food down her neck until she fucking chokes the little faggot bitch). No quite the contrary, this piss poor couple were merely the catalyst for my current annoyance, my topic is that of monogamy. I am currently finding myself in the situation where one man is simply not enough, however I am entirely convinced that I am not alone. Once women reach the stage of a relationship where the man sees fit to fart, scratch his balls, or take a shit in front of you, I\u2019m not the only one who experiences the fight or flight response. In case you are interested I always go with the latter. I will never be so comfortable with someone as to sit and gaze adoringly whilst the object of my affections sleeps with his gob wide open and several gallons of spit flowing onto my freshly washed pillows. The feelings of disgust are too strong. Yeah back to the point and leaving the tangent\u2026men I have relationships with piss me off. You take me for granted, make a mess on my bed, MY BED \u2013 I HAVE TO SLEEP THERE WHEN YOU ARE GONE YOU KNOW, and expect me to jump on your gdam dick just because its hard in the morning. Then you have the nerve to call me a prudish bitch because I\u2019m tired. Well guess what? If I didn\u2019t have to put so much fucking energy into faking it all the time, I\u2019d have enough to jump on your fucking cock first thing, so who\u2019s fault is it that I go looking elsewhere now? *breathes* So anyway, the whole point of this piece is to say that I don\u2019t blame the guy for shopping around ya know? I\u2019m sure men are just as annoyed by women waving their tampons in front of them or whatever, so they probably share my view, just with re-application.

Missions for the day included: Seeing the Sarcophagus's at the British Museum, Having Lunch in Ladbroke Grove with the Rastaferians, Soho and Harrods. 3 out of 4 aint bad, considering we also visited Portobello Road Market, and China Town. The Train journey was cool, it took about three hours, and it allowed me to have Alcohol before 8am. This is The route: Newcastle to Kings Cross, with a few stops inbetween. The only other interesting passengers tho, was a bunch of Saint John's Ambulance kids.. From Kings Cross, we took the Tube to Russel Square, and headed for the museum, we passed through Russel Park, and laughed at the smackheads who were passed out on the grass. Some old guy passed us and he was wearing a mink coat with these leather sandals, pretty pimp i reckoned. Anyways, This was our destination: The place is really Huge, This pic only shows like, the middle third of it. You'd need about three days to see everything that's on exhibit. We only wanted to see mummies! we also saw sphinx's and other cool shit When we were done, we stood outside with Irish reporters, ooo they were fantastic! They were wearing three piece suits and Trilby hats and they had a lead on Prince William, who had apparently made a phone call from a box near the Museum, talking about heading into Soho. Cool, aye. Next stop was the Market on Portobello Road, it stretches for ever. The day we went, it was an Antique Market and there was loads of stuff to look at. But what did we buy?? A couple of fridge magnets, Lol.. mine looks like this: At the top end of Portobello Rd, is Ladbroke Grove, where we had Chicken and chirizzo salad, at a place called Uncles. It was very good, 5/5! It was a huge serving also. We stayed at Uncles for a bit, and just enjoyed watching a lot of very pretty foreign people walk back and forth, No one who lives in London is actually English it seems. Next Stop was Soho! But we had to get to Piccadilly Circus first. For me, who's a small town girl whose never been anywhere remotely exciting, Piccadilly Circus was just.. Fantastic That's the statue of Eros Pictures don't do it justice, you have to be there and feel the buzz of it. Soho was class. We sat and had coffee opposite a XXX video store, and watched while a few sleazy men went in and out with carrier bags. There were loads of people, but it was quiet, and we just strolled around, there was market here also. Then we rounded a corner and.. GAY PRIDE, WOO!@ We were met with sights such as.. and.. hmm.. i could go on forever..Lol. And having to squeeze our way through all the men, was.. hard work. China Town was really great! It's mainly Restaurants, but there's a few little gift shops, where i bought a lovely little handbeaded kittykat purse and an oriental fan. And after we had something to eat.. it was time to head back to Kings Cross, alas. The ride home was actually pretty great. A seat across from us was reserved, and of course, it had to be a weirdo who was sitting there. A weirdo who thought that my friend and i were lesbians and had been to London for Gay Pride all because.. We had the same colour tops on. I swear! These were his own words.. \"you mean you aren't lesbians?..but you have the same top on..\" He was bizarre.

Bingo! Olympic National Park by Port Angeles - It's new, it's not too far away and we can take the ferry from Victoria straight there. We pack our bags (prepare for rain) and head for the Coho. Did I mention that the west side of the Olympics gets rained on 344 days out of the year? Yeah. Saturday [am] We board the Coho and the first thing that pops in my mind \"is this thing legally allowed to transport people?\" It looks like it's about to sink at dock. We look at the proudly displayed plaque which read something like circa 1960-something. The boat shoves off and we are on our way. Heavy rocking the whole trip, I managed to fight off the mounting pressures to offer my lunch to the boat - no way! this stinking boat is NOT getting the best of me (that being sushi and tempura - mmm). We arrive in sunny (read rainy) Port Angeles and disembark through what I can only describe as some-sorta-thing-that-is-supposed-to-be-customs. To the pub we go (hey it IS the long weekend damnit). After a beer it was time to find a bus to take us to the mountain. We find one, we manage to buy a fare and get on board. We are ON OUR WAY! The bus takes a freaking long time to slowly meander its way up to the ranger station in Olympic National Park. We spend the time planning our route. Looks like there's a nice trail which leaves from the ranger station up some switchbacks to a ridge which runs along for a few km then drops into a valley. Looks like a perfect loop which should keep us hiking till Monday. The bus FINALLY pulls into the park. Thank God. At this point we had so much time that we had the whole route planned out. I would have started colouring the contour lines if the bus had taken any longer...anyways thats not important. We get out, we walk to the ranger station to let them know where we are going and when we are expected back (we are such GOOD hikers aren't we?). Ranger: Howdy folks, what can I do for you? Us: We're doing a 3 days hike in the park and wanted to leave some info with you in case we go missing Ranger: Well sure thing where you folks headed? Us: [shows map] Up here from here and up the switchbacks to this ridge then... Ranger: You're NOT going HERE are you [points to our well planned route]?? Us: well actually... Ranger: You CAN'T go here, no one's been up there in 10 years! The trail is impassable! Us: well, uh, we had it all planned, umm Ranger: There are three bridges on this hike and they are all washed out! Us: ... Ranger: Well you folks had better pick another hike, this one here is good [points to other side of the park] Us: oh well.. Ranger: yeah beautiful hike, just drive on down to.. Us: uh we don't have a car, we took the bus here Ranger: oh well now, no busses go here, you're gunna need a car Us: crap [flabbergasted and frustrated] Ranger: well let me know what you boys are going to do We leave the station feeling deflated. We take a hard look at the map. Trevor: No hike is impassable Wes: oh yeah it could be Trevor: Let's do it Wes: ok We tell the ranger we will try the hike, he tells us he'll be seeing us soon. The hike starts out easy, meandering along a stream which quickly turns into a river. Amongst the marshy plants we come up to a crossing. The river has widened to about 20 meters and is quite deep. On the other side is what we believed to be the remains of what used to be a bridge. The trail ends here and continues on the other side. We are surrounded by heavy bush, devils club and skunk cabbage as well as a big marsh. We have to cross. Off come the boots, on go the sandals and we begin our wade across the river. The current is flowing quickly and we both feel off balance and a little unsure of our choice of action. Step, step, step, SPLOOSH. Trevor takes a bail into the river and is swept downstream. I get on it and grab his pack to stop him. We're half way, completely soaked and the shoes that were tied to the outside of our packs have been dunked into the river. This is a good way to start a hike. On the other side we spend some time ringing out the shoes and the socks we stuffed in them. We assess the damage - packs are wet but contents inside are dry. We decide to continue (actually this wasn't much of a choice since we weren't about to cross BACK). Two more washed out bridges later, we end up beginning out ascent up the switchbacks. At this point I have a nice squish squish sound from the combination of my soaking wet boots and wool socks. Did I mention that my boots are Gortex? Great stuff! Keeps water out. Guess what? Keeps water IN too! The ascent is steep and the trail is overgrown (gee its like no one was up here in 10 years or something). As we get further into the switchbacks we are forced to climb over some large tree trunks that have fallen across the trail. I'd say maybe 10 or so of these large trunks were in our way. These trees were HUGE. We actually had to climb over them. No problem! We clamber over each of them one at a time. They had fallen almost directly across the trail. We finish crossing the last visible tree and feel relieved. The thing about switchbacks is that they cross back and forward over the same wide patch of steep land. Now imagine that, say a tree, were to fall down the steep slope that the switchback was traversing, what would happen? That's right! The tree would fall across every part of the switchback so when you finish crossing the tree on one switchback, you get to cross the same tree again on the next switch - rinse, repeat. So say it takes 45 minutes to clamber over 10 logs only to find the trail turns and switches back about 10 times. That's 10x45 minutes, 450 minutes of tree climbing goodness (BTW it started to pour at this point making clambering over the trees especially slippery). Ok so after 450 or so minutes we clear the trees and the switchback starts cutting into a weird marshy patch in the middle of the mountain. No worries, the worst is over... We get to the marshy area and notice something - the trail is gone. Underneath a thick canopy of marshy plants is the trail - we think. Actually we can't say for certain there is ground at all, but we THINK there is. We're pretty sure. We start walking through the marshy plants and realized two things: 1. The plants are VERY slippery in the heavy rain making walking a challenge 2. We really can't see the ground! We're feeling each step with our feet. It only took one fall each for us to realize the third, and most important thing: 3. Those marshy plants are urlLink Devil's Club . Yeah read that paragraph on the \"spines that cause wounds to be easily infected\". The first fall was me I think. Walking along, testing the next step, taking it, suddenly losing all concept of up and down, realizing I am sliding down the mountain, grabbing for anything to stop me. Devil's club is a lovely plant. It has spikes under its leaves so your legs get a nice surprise when you walk through, the stems have spikes so you can sink your hands into them when careening down the mountain. Too bad the spikes conveniently come off the stems when you grab so you can't even rely on their being in your flesh to help stop your decent down the mountain. Needless to say we treaded VERY carefully from there on in and I didn't even think to pick the spikes out of my hands until we cleared the zone. I should mention here that not only was it raining heavily but that Trevor had the empathy for my lack of planning (I did not bring rain pants) and quite happily chose NOT to wear his own rain pants to make me feel better (thanks dude! you didn't need to!). Ok so what more can go wrong? Well let me tell you... We finish the ascent up the switchbacks. It is now Saturday [pm] and we have covered about 2km of distance (we had planned this to be done in under and hour). Change of plans, we can't possibly do our loop at this rate. We consult the map and find that there is a chute from the ridge out of the park. This hike wasn't going well so we decided to bail out and attempt to keep our Monday for healing up. We make a B-line for the ridge. It's getting dark, we are exhausted and there seems to be no end to the slope of the trail we are on. There is no good camping spot. We keep moving. The trail flattens and we're on the ridge. It's now getting VERY dark. We pitch the tent, we make food and... Trevor: See that tree? Wes: which tree?, oh yeah? Trevor: It's bark has been ripped off, see the claw marks? That's a.. Together: Grizzly paw mark! Wes: ... Trevor: umm we just pitched our tent next to a bears kitchen Wes: We gotta put everything we cooked with into the stuffsack and tree it Trevor: Ok lets go We quickly packed up all our cooking clothes, cooking utensils, stoves and toothpaste and put it into the stuffsack. We hiked what felt like miles out and tree'd our food. We returned to the tent (which was sitting on the only flat ground within a few km) and crawled in. As much as I'd like to say we had a shadow circling our tent I believe this may have just been a dream. Regardless it was not an evening of heavy sleeping. Next morning we got up, hiked the couple km to the food back, de-treed it, ate breakfast and got the hell out of there. We descended quickly into the valley and followed the nice cushy trail out. Remember the gortex boots that doesn't let water out? Well I still had a small pool on each foot. By this point I had a blister the size of half my foot under my arch and it HURT. Once we got out from the valley we were in a small parking lot off the side of the highway which runs through the park. No bus will come here. We get the awesome idea that somebody will give us a ride. Why not? Two very wet, very dirty, sweaty men with large soaking packs and BO that would make a skunk blush? Who wouldn't pick us up? The thumbs go up. Cars pass. More cars pass. Not many cars on this highway. Then the unthinkable happens. A tiny honda civic pulls in with a young guy and his girlfriend. We are SO thankful yet completely perplexed - how on earth will we fit with the packs? Well we made it happen. The first thing that occurred once we were all squished in there, packs on our laps, was the smell. Gawd almighty it was terrible. The accumulation of blood, sweat, tears and devils club poison had made quite the potpourri. The windows came down with haste. The guy drove fast to try to circulate the air quickly. The girl didn't seem to care much and I was surprised. She asked us where we were from... Us: Victoria Girl: Really?! Canada? Us: Well yeah Victoria is in Canada Girl: That's great, I love Canada! I took the ferry over last weekend to celebrate my 18th birthay so I could drink! Us: Oh thats cool.. Girl: Yeah I love Canada, it's so quiet and such a nice island city Us: You mean Victoria? Girl: Yeah Canada Guy: [looks embarrassed and somewhat annoyed] Victoria is just one city in Canada babe Girl: Where else is in Canada? Us: ... Guy: sooo... Trevor: Hey where are you two from Girl: Right here Guy: Venezuala Trevor: Really? A conversation struck up. It was cool to see how small the world is sometimes. They dropped us off at the ferry terminal. We went in and had a beer at the pub. I took the boots off and proceeded to look at the blister I had been nurturing. Not good. It would need to be drained, no biggie, gimme something sharp. Ok I'll leave the blister part out now as it's pretty damn gross.

I have only been up on this trail once last year in summer, which I remember is quite strenuous for casual hiker. I told him that there is still a lot of snow this time of the year and may not be an enjoyable hike. He insisted to try it -- why not? So I called up Wes to join us and we decided to climb the Camel once we top-out the Crown summit. Not a bad idea. urlLink The Crown and The Camel As usual I slept-in and ended up late for one hour to show up in the Grouse gondola parking lot. My excuse was having difficulty to put on the contact lens. I never liked putting this jelly stuff on my eye but I had no choice -- I dropped my glass off the cliff down 200meters into bushes, when rappelling off from Wall of Attrition with Andrew. Silly me. So I have rope, cams and whole bunch of stuffs on my backpack. We took the gondola up to save our knees. (I got busted of using Sandy's lift-card). After started walking 10 minutes or so we saw snow, very thick blanket of snow. Wes took the lead walking confidently and gracefully, and Danny doing quite well tagging along. I fell behind and wonder why I was so slow, started to blame my heavy pack and shitty hiking boot. Finally I realized that I am just don't have the good balance and technique walking on snow. urlLink Grouse mountain? That way! We passed the Little Goat mountain, we can see the Crown and Camel clearly. It is so close visually, though sitting in front of us is a very deep gully means we have to hike down few hundred meters before gaining the uphill trail to Crown. I know it is quite steep, plus now it is completely covered by four feet of snow made the descent very sketchy, not to mention we were actually off-route a little therefore no established foot-print to follow. In front of us was a steep, snow-covered open valley, much like the black-diamond skiing routes in Whistler. So I buckled up my waist-trap and get myself ready for the descent. Wes and Danny followed closely behind. urlLink Dance Dance Revolution! I made my first step, felt the grip was not very positive. For a normal hiker would have re-established a better foot hole -- But I did not. I must have been getting too used to rock climbing that I thought I was climbing on slab, assuming the shoe rubber would grip the ground anyway. Next second I realized something went terribly wrong - I slipped, with nothing to grab onto, started sliding down the gully!! To make it worst, my backpack acts like a crazy carpet, accelerating at mad speed. So I keep sliding, watching the trees down below got closer and closer. Few seconds later I woke up from complete shock and decided to do something. I know I would hurt myself really bad if I hit the tree thirty more meters below. I finally managed to turn my body and gained fiction with my elbows, knees and toes. Ten more meters after, it came to a complete stop. I maintained this position (Wes would have laughed on me for rest of the week if he saw it) for next minute or so, afraid that I would start slipping again. I regained my breath and noticed my whole body was wet. Oh god it was a hell of a ride, for at least 50 meters at unstoppable speed! It was silent, I guess Wes and Danny were too focus on their footstep, rather than yelling if I was actually okay. 20 minutes later Wes and Danny showed up, and joked about how I saved 20minutes by taking such a joy ride. They thought it was cool... Until I showed them the snow-burnt on my elbow... urlLink trekking up the hollow snow flake It seemed to me that after this incident I got a better grip on snow, and we trekked up the gully at great speed. By 3:30pm we arrived the summit of Crown, overseeing the whole Vancouver and the range and range of mountains behind. It is the same fantastic view as last summer, except this time the mountains are all covered by snow. So we still have an extra hour or so, Wes and I decided to climb the Camel, it took a rather hairy rappel into a very exposed col to reach the base of Camel. I pick the classic sandbag 5.9 crack route and getting ready to witness how sandbag it was. After few yelling and pushing I arrived the top and Wes followed swiftly. Danny was sitting at the summit watching us the whole time. It was sensational to stand on the Camel, waving at him in this fine position. This is the most memorable moment of the day. Wes and I simul-climb back to the Crown and started heading down around 5pm. We returned to the gondola by 9pm, just before the sunset.

It was very good and fairly well organized, although some of the bride's maids may not agree with me. Jen and Nick look like a perfect couple and I'm glad they found each other and are now ready to embark on their journey together. After the wedding, Sandy and I headed up to Tofino. We arrived around 4:30pm and checked out Chesterman Beach before checking into our hotel. The beach was really nice and there are pictures urlLink here . The amazing thing about Clayoquot sound is that it is exposed to the brunt of the pacific giving it nice big waves (esp in Long Beach). The effect of large waves crashing against rock is very cool. On top of this there are sandbars all around Tofino which breaks up the swells into waves. We checked into our Hotel : urlLink Inn at the Tough City . The place smelled like sushi from the sushi bar on the main floor. As we decended to our room (room #1), there was a stench which we could not place. The room itself was quite nice tho and we settled in. We took a stroll up the block into \"downtown Tofino\". Wow it was very quiet! We found a place called urlLink The Loft and ate there. It was a LONG wait. We left our names and they told us 45 minutes so we went back to the hotel and watched some TV. 30 mins later we showed up and they had already called our names so we waited...and finally got a table. Food was mediocre. We ordered muscles and they were way overcooked. The other food was ok. We then retired to our hotel and watched the food network =p Day 2 we got up early and headed off on our urlLink Hot Springs Tour . The ride to the springs is about 1.5 hours and it goes through some exposed seas which left the boat rocking a LOT. I was fine along with Sandy until this one girl got sick and her friend told the driver to \"stop the boat\". Note: when sea sick on a boat NEVER stop the boat...NEVER NEVER NEVER! That makes things WAY worse. Anyways the boat was stopped, the girl puked and the rest of us got rocked in the boat and I started feeling sick. The boat soon started up again and by that time Sandy was out back puking. I kept my eyes on the horizon but then the boat stopped (!!) to look for a whale. At this point I was ready to say \"fuck the whale, lets keep moving\" but i bit my lip and then proceeded to run to the back to hurl. Finally we reach the dock and after a nice 40 minute jaunt through the rainforest on beautiful boardwalk we reach the spings. The springs pop up out of the ground at around 50C and proceeds to cascade down a waterfall into three pools. The top pool being the hottest. We had a good time despite the pouring rain. The ride back in the boat was much calmer and we made it clear that we wanted a fast trip back...but we did stop once to look at a sea cave which was pretty cool. We got back to our hotel and hung out for a few hours before heading out to urlLink The Wickaninnish for Dinner. Damn. This place is nice. Very posh which explains the price. Dinner was a 7 course meal. I had the seafood sampler and Sandy had the Signature sampler. We did NOT go for wine as it would have put me way over =p. The food was excellent and the service was top notch. My water was never emptied. When I went to the bathroom I put my napkin on my chair. I got back and the napkin was folded and on my chair arm. Very nice! We ate way too much...this is a FULL meal for sure! Day 3, we woke up lazily to brilliant sunshine! Nice! I got some good pics of this day since the sun was out :) We went back to the urlLink The Wickaninnish for Lunch since it has a stunning view and we hung out there for a bit, then proceeded to Long Beach to watch the surfers.

A good all round weekend!\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Ok this is a recap of the weekend: OCT 31st, Halloween madness ----------------------------- The night started out pretty well. I borrowed a costume from Cristian at work and brought it home. I then spent the next 1.5 hours trying to get it on properly while at the same time trying to make it downstairs to hand out candy. Dan and Erin would good about the candy handling while I cursed upstairs in complete confusion. I gave up shortly after 1.5 hours and decided to make an evening of resume writing and laundry. Laura came over around 9ish. She and Erin convinced me to try again. My main problem was not udnerstanding how not to make the costume look like it bulged in wierd places. They put me back in the costume and then stuffed it with pillows which seemed to give it a much more uniform and proper look. I was then invited to join them in their urlLink party army incursion to several parties that evening. I accepted and plans were in motion. Being a volunteer/tag along to the party army is hard work. You must have a strong conviction and dedication to the cause. Party Army Followers are not necessarily about finding the best party and staying there, it is about experiencing many parties and passing judgement on them. The more parties you visit, the more variety you see and the more people you meet. Anyways the boiled down version (if my memory serves correctly): 22:00 : 112 East Hastings Street - The worst block in NA, we hit a party in an abandoned store which turned out to be a rather cool flat which was being shared by several people. We spent about 30 mins there since it was early and people had not arrived yet. We promised to be back later as the place had \"potential\". 22:45 : 637 East Georgia - A Funky house (very well kept!). This was the house of a rather entertaining actor (I think) who had a gathering of party-goers. The host had a great costume. He has chunks of neck and face torn off and a cute little tiger with bloody fangs as a puppet. Speaking of cool costumes, this little costume I had was borrowed and it consists of a baby and a grandma. Grandma is inflated and baby is essentially me. However the way it looks is a baby riding on grandma's back. My legs are grandma's legs and my head is baby's head. It looks MESSED UP! But very cool. I was surprised at how many people came up to me at parties and commented on the costume. Women were especially taken by this thing. I was in quite a level of shock. 23:30 : 338 W. King Ed (nr. Cambie) - Natasha's Big Halloween blast. I was told this was THE place to be for halloween and it is always a riot. They were totally right. The place was PACKED and full of very fun people. These guys really got into the spirit of the whole thing! Lots of decorations inside complete with spider webs on all walls plus bats from the ceiling and headstones along the hallway. Amazing. The Party Army hung out here way longer than anywhere else. We stayed for almost 2 hours before some dickhead skinheads started a fight and threw someone through a window. This dampered the mood and it was time to depart. 01:30 : Back to East Hastings - We thought the party must be pumpin by now, but alas it was not. Something about a roomate not wanting the music so loud. It was abort abort abort and out of there like a bat out of hell. 01:45 : 252 E 1st or 2nd Ave - My memory begins to get hazy here. The next three locations may not be in this order. Regardless they all shared the same outcome - Busted, fizzling or non-existent. 02:00 : 918 W.19th 02:15 : 2015 W. 49th Ave (at Main) 02:30 : Regroup at Natasha's and stayed here till it was time to head home. All in all a great time and quite the hell of a first mission for me. I was tired but happy to have gone and I can really appreciate the hard work the Party Army does. NOV 1, Get up, buy buns, head to Victoria ---------------------------------------- After last night I somehow woke up on my own at 9:00am. Don't ask. Anyways I drove to chinatown and bough some dai bow. I then proceeded to do laundry whilst madly burning CDs for Leslie as I wanted to give them to her this trip. The ferry ride was uneventful. I started reading a book that James lent me. Did I mention that every time I visit James he gives me a new book to read? Yeah. And I'm a slow-ass reader..I'm actually backlogged on books to read which isn't too surprising to James. Anyways, so I'm reading the Kandy Koloured Tangerine Flake Streamline Baby. Interesting title. Interesting book. I arrived in Victoria and Sandy picked me up. We went back to the house and then went out shopping for a bit. 6:00pm was the dinner reservations. At 5:30 we were in the process of buying cake when panic set into the people at home. Calls started around 5:25 and proceeded till 5:40 when we arrived home to find everyone outside in the cold waiting for us to arrive. Embarassing indeed! Anyways we all rush out and manage to lock Sandy's cousin in the house. After this we drive to Sechuan City. From here on it was nothing but eating. I enjoyed many dishes including both lobster AND crab. My god...so much food. This was topped off with cake at home followed by a coma in Jeff's room. NOV 2, Eat, eat, eat -------------------- Got up, ate a bow. Went to dim sum at Fountain Restaurante which turned out to be a buffet. I was still full from last night but hey its all good. So we ate buffet...mmm..... Then Sandy and I visited Leslie and I gave her the transformer cds I had madly burned the day before. Sandy and I then went to Goldstream and saw the Salmon Spawning. My god. So many fish! There were volunteers there who answered questions. I learned a bit about the spawing process...it's pretty wild! We hit the nature house too and I filled out a raffle for a kayak...mmm....fingers crossed We returned home to head out for another dinner....more eating....lots of food...LOTS of food.

After this hearty repas, I proceeded to clean the bathroom and kitchen as it was a long time coming and I was looking for something to do. We made plans to meet up with Nat and co. at around 1:00pm. In the interim I decided to swim at the brittania pool. Why on earth do I not go there more often? It's close, it's good exercise and I felt good after 24 lenths (short lengths). We met up with Nat, Praise, Connie, Herb, Nick, Junko and Sally at the club and chatted up a bit. They closed the bistro so we ended up going to Taco Del Mar for a quick bite (the lady thought Erin and I were dating I think) and then off to Praise's house for a little chat. I took some snaps of everyone :) urlLink which is linked here . I could not help but notice the way the picture turned out with Herb slouched in a relaxed state. Check out the photo and you will see.

Nat pointed out to us that Erin and I made very good roomates and it got be thinking back to the day I called Erin to see if she wanted to move in with me. I had my doubts on whether we would get along but somehow we did very well and it has been a great experience all round.

Metrotown last night was a zoo at 10:00pm. I went there with Sandy and her brother as he had some last minute gifts to buy. We picked up some odds and ends and I managed to complete out her present with some extra add ons. Today I got up at 9:30 and Erin helped motivate me to get ready as she called Jen and James for breakfast at the Elbow Room. I heard about this place from friends - good food, brash service. I was looking forward to being insulted by waiters. We called Jen and determined that she and James had just gotten up - no doubt from the phone call - and were in a disorganized state. I believe Jen said \"we can be ready in 10 minutes\" to which Erin replied \"well we have to DRIVE there so you'll have to wait damnit!\" but alas I'm probably paraphrasing from the sieve I'd like to call my brain. We actually ended up leaving the house earlier than expected and, as a consequence, arriving at Jen's early. This surprised them and they were still in a state of dissaray. Regardless, after some sussing and one call from Gord stating that he would be late (I say this with absolutely no colouring of his tardy past). We made out way to the Elbow Room and had a great meal which included the waiter telling us to get our own water over THERE and some mention of urlLink lavalife being open on holidays in response to a remark that we were all going on dates afer our meal. Apres breakfast we headed back to Jen's and ended up being sucked into the comforts of her downtown pad to which we lounged and chatted extensively. In some strange turn of events, Erin ended up taking her pants off to prove a point, this led to Jen doing the same (albiet this time in the privacy of her kitchen). Following this strange turn of events we departed and headed homeward bound where I proceeded on my quest to locate a \"money tree\" and Erin went to work out. I wish I had worked out instead. I met up with Sandy after she had her \"high tea\" with Claire and Vivian. In the hour we had between arriving at her place and leaving for the Ferries, we exchanged and opened gifts (yay) and searched her apartment for her necklace. I'd like to point out here that I had suspected that it had somehow torn loose and ended up in her bra to which I was quite happy to help her search, however she believed this to be a ploy on my part and refused a thorough search of the bra. This led to the search radius to leave her body and out to the apartment which was searched in vain. Tonight I got a confirmation that the bra was in fact housing the escapee necklace. Moral of the story? When a boyfriend asks to grope your breats in an attempt to help you find something, don't argue, just let him do it, he might be on to something. After dropping off Sandy it was homeward bound to install the new computers I had purchased for my parents and they had purchased for my sister. All went smoothly (relatively).

We signed up for a new years party at urlLink aquatica at the Vancouver Aquarium. Before we went we had a giant sushi party at Sandy's where we extended both leaves of her table and piled samurai sushi on it. When I went to pick up samurai sushi there was a line down the block. My first thoughts were \"dumbasses, they shoulda pre-ordered\". Unfortunatley much to my dismay I discovered the line was actually for people who DID pre-order and are waiting to pick up. The place had a weird system of collecting phone numbers from everyone in line and then proceeding to run inside to prepare the \"line of orders\". This would have worked out famously if the line actually stayed in order when it entered the small store. However once people go through the door they sort of spilled out in the pockets of space between table and chairs like water moves into a confined space. So then they started yelling out phone numbers and people were clambering on each other to pay. One guy looked furious as he had been waiting a claimed \"1 hour\" and had not gotten his sushi. It turns out he missed his phone number and it was shelved. Anyways so I get the sushi finally and head homeward bound. I get to Sandy's with barely any time to spare but everyone else arrived late anyways. We ate a lot of sushi. Samurai is still king on size and value. After dinner we proceeded down to the aquarium - 2 Designated Drivers. We got there and the place was EMPTY! so sad but we were early and we managed to catch the tail end of a dolphin show. We pretty much explored the venues for an hour or so before more people started arriving. There was a very cool giant tank of fish in one area with an oxygen room next to it. The oxygen area was a little booth of 4 stations setup with different \"flavours of O2\". You stick a hose in your nose and breath in deep to get some aromatherapy action and 95% pure O2. Gord, Dan, Steve and I all did it. It wasn't that impressive but I guess something worth saying you tried. The rest of the night was dancing and not drinking (for me) and admiring the fish and taco (octopus). Actually the beluga tank was very cool...damn they are big. They had a sad excuse for a dive show however where the divers tried to be entertaining and it was pretty sad. The seal tank was very entertaining as they are very curious and cute. They came right up to the glass with their huge eyes and sorta looked at you...some pepople waved their party favours in front of the window and they tracked them (fixated on them). It was kinda cool and you can make them do barrel rolls by waving stuff in circles. Over the course of the night we had beer thrown on us by accident (i got splashed really well) and then I managed to bump Steve's glass of champagne and spill all over my sleave. So drenched in beer we kept dancing the night away and rung in the new year with the other 990 people in the aquarium. The night ended with a brief panic attack when I lost my coat check stub but managed to recover my stuff anyways. After a brief sleep and a wakeup alarm at 9:00am on New Years Day, we proceeded to start packing up Sandy's place and getting ready for her move back to Victoria. After making a hasty retreat to my house, I started getting ready for breakfast and putting all the things in motion for some pancakes and ice cream. People arrived late (around noon instead of 11:30) and we didnt get eating till 12:30. We were slated for the polar bear swim so we ate quickly and started trying to motivate people to leave. It's hard to move that many poeple out of the house that quickly. At 2:00pm we left the house and quickly headed down for english bay. We parked illegally and ran to the venue where it essentially began. The rush down the beach was envigorating and running through patches and snow and sand made me wonder why the hell i was doing this. Entry into the water was not shocking at all...it was quite nice actually. Vivian and Dan also went in as part of the mass party of people. It was a lot of fun and a great way to ring in the new year. Mimosas were made afterwards and there was much rejoicing - yay.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "It's been a while since I've updated my blog.

The word is normally used in conjunction with statements about a lack of ability (a particular student lacks the ability to study etc.). This idea seems to be anathema to a lot of people working in education. From a constructionist/postmodern viewpoint, no one lacks ability, it's just that some people did not have the right environment/encouragement/what have you and so present accordingly. Fair enough, in a sense. At least anecdotally I am aware of a number of people who fit this description (or a similar one) that when given the chance did very well. The problem arises if this notion of ability is something very real - perhaps intelligence is a very real thing and one needs it to succeed at this level. If this is true it has implications for our ideas about 'widening access' to University study. Without something that more or less equates to an ability test, we have the potential for admitting people who lack this ability, where it becomes our responsibility to ensure that they have the tools to do as well as they can. Furthermore, if we succomb to the pressure to widen access and we end up admitting more students who lack this ability, we will be under further pressure to drop standards. I'm not really settled on this issue. I know a lot of people who would subscribe to the ability theory, and I know people who would find it abhorrent. Certainly from the point of view of persons from minority groups the notion of ability has been used against them without justification, and I think they are right to be wary of it. But at the same time it is difficult to put aside nagging doubts that occur from observing the struggles of some students to come to grips with thinking .

We are trying alot of different things with this show, and you really are going to want to check it out. One thing we are doing a little differently is reverting to our classic format for shows. What I mean is that we aren't trying to tell a large, hour long story with this show. Rather, we are doing things the old way, where we have penned a bevy of hilarious sketches, seemingly unrelated to each other. Of course, because we are geniuses, and have a lot of dumb luck, things still tie together wonderfully at the end. There are a handful of shows that I think are the \"Best\" the Dwellers have ever done. In that list are Decon Santa, Kiwanis, and some of the older ones that we did during that golden summer. I don't quite remember the year of that summer, but the show that sticks out in my mind is the show in which we had the most guns in a Dweller show... ever. There were something like twelve guns on stage at one time! And yet, throughout the show, only one character died and that was of natural causes. It was a wonderful show, where all of the skits were written independently but in the end, thanks to being at the right place at the right time, we were able to pretty much tie together every skit. It was beautiful. And so this show is taking an interesting course. We have chosen a theme instead of a plot. That theme is \"Japanese Pop Culture.\" It all came about when Larry and Joe came up with an idea for a skit (I won't give away what that skit was), and when they told everyone about it, I totally dug the idea of making the whole show sort of themed around the crazy Japanese culture (what with their samurais, ninjas, monsters, food, and videogames). Originally trying to make the show like we had done Kiwanis and Decon, we tried to come up with this elaborate plot involving a samurai sword (and whomever had the sword became a samurai). We realized this idea was tired, and not as interested as first imagined... and so we set out and worked on some ideas, wrote some skits, and did some improv... and the end result is \"Godzillas and Generals\" And while the show isn't completely about Japanese culture, we managed to get some funny skits involving Godzilla, samurais, ninjas and a special surprise. Along with these themed skits, we also have some great satirical sketches and a special \"guest character\" from everyone's favorite rock group: Blue Oyster Cult! Enough of me giving away info about our show... You are just going to have to check it out. Of course, it was brought to me attention the other day, while enjoying some coffee at Cafe Kolache, that our opening show is on the same night as the new Harry Potter movie. While most other sketch comedy and improv troupes would be frightened by this, the Cellar Dwellers do not waver. We don't even flinch.. we will fight Harry Potter, just as we have in the past, with our humor! I think we can pull in more people than that puberty-breaching, girl-clamoring kiddie fest. Of course, if the Dwellers are going to try and pull in over 100 million in our first weekend, we are going to need your help. Friday, June 4th at the CCBC Allied Health Auditorium. (CCBC stands for Community College of Beaver County, for those of you not from the area). The show begins at 8:00pm and will run until around 10. Tickets are just $5.00 and reservations can be made in advance by e-mailing the Dwellers: reservations@thecellardwellers.com or checking out our website. If you can't make it this Friday, due to work (NOT due to Harry Potter... which, I assure you, is no excuse) then you have one more chance to check out this hilarious sketch show next Saturday, June 12th also at the CCBC auditorium. It starts at 8:00 and tickets are also $5. But if you bring your Harry Potter ticket stub, we can charge you $7.50 instead... it's only fair. And so, hope to see you there! Feel free to comment and ask questions about the show... or just come find out for yourself next Friday.

As I also have mentioned, traveling can lead to all sorts of adventures. Such was the case last Saturday. I had left the triumphant improv show at the Copper dog - 4 paying customers, woohoo. It was fairly late, almost 12:30 am as I piloted my '93 Lumina - or 'The Silver Bullet' as I like to call it - through Rochester. I was almost out of Rochester when I looked in my rear view mirror and saw the one sight sure to invoke terror in the mind of all motorist. I was being chased by Dan Akroyd. Just checking to see if you're paying attention. What my mirror really revealed was the flashing lights of a police officer. Is there any more nerve racking event than being pulled over by the cops? Well, yes I guess there is. Trench warfare comes to mind. Still, getting pulled over always manages to be a good sucker punch experience. One minute you're driving along quite happily, feeling free. The next minute some guy with a mustache - they always have mustaches - is shining a flashlight in your face. I tried to play it cool. I made a concerted effort to have all my paper work ready for the officer which was a fools errand. My glove box explodes like a party favor when opened. Papers fly everywhere. Every piece of paper work I have ever received for my car is in there. I have registrations dating back to the mid 70's. I don't know what car they belong to, but they're there. I was able to find my current registration. It was rolled in a ball under an ancient half full bag of Skittles. I greeted the officer kindly, \"Hello officer. How are you tonight. Beautiful night for a drive isn't it.\" I practically had to muzzle myself before I became just a little too friendly. I was half a step from saying: \"Say officer, has anyone ever told you your an attractive man? You must work out.\" Remember, when talking to the police there is a fine line between polite and catching-a-beat-down-with-a-flashlight polite. \"You know I clocked going 50 back there,\" The officer said. \"You were also a little erratic. You went over the double yellow and the white lines.\" Crap, I thought to myself, looks like its alphabet backward time for James. But I'm sober. At least I think I'm sober. I only had 1-1.5 beers at Copper Dog. That was a couple hours ago. I couldn't be drunk. But what if they were super beers? What the hell's a super beer? I remained quiet and tried my best too look sober, which I was. I offered him my license and registration. Always be helpful to the police when they pull you over. If you have food in the car offer it to them. \"Oh,\" the officer said, \"I also need your insurance card.\" (flashback a couple of days: my mother: James, your insurance card came in the mail. me: Just leave it there. I'll get it.) I didn't have my insurance card, the fine for - the officer tells me - is a 6 month suspension of your driver's license. I panic. I tell the officer I have it. I show him the most recent card freshly expired. He seems to understand. I can't tell. He's got a flashlight in my face. \"Where are you coming from?\" \"The Copper Dog.\" I think it best not to lie. I was at a bar. \"Doing a little drinking were you?\" \"Just one or two a couple hours ago. I was doing a show. I'm an actor.\" \"What kind of show?\" \"Improv comedy. I'm a member of the Cellar Dwellers. Check out our website www.thecellardwellers.com\" Did I just plug the Cellar Dwellers? Was that a good idea? The officer seemed to accept it. It was the truth. Then, the officer went back to his cruiser. Now, I have no idea what cops do when they take your paper work back into their car, but I have a sneaking suspicion it's nothing. They're just making you sweat. They're probably back there smoking a cigarette or brewing some coffee or shaving or playing the harmonica or doing any number of other inane pursuits while your left pondering your fate. I was sweating bullets. I needed my license. I can't afford to pay for a ticket. The ticket could be worth more than I am right now. I'd have to sell plasma just to make ends meet. Eventually, the officer returns and a miracle happens. I swear it was a miracle. Little things like this confirm my belief in a loving God. The officer uttered those sweet, sweet little words: \"I'm going to let you off with a warning.\" Praise God, hallelujah. I feel like singing. I feel like dancing. I want to hug the officer. I don't. It probably wouldn't have been the wisest of choices. I restrain myself. I do thank the officer and wish him a pleasant night. And then, just like that, I am free. I drive away with joy in my heart and less lead in my foot. Shalom\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I was just about to spend another day bored out of my mind. I had spent the morning doing some designing, graphically of course, and had just left to visit my local Sheetz. When I got back home, Danny and I sat down with my dad to watch some Fox News over lunch. But wait... what's this? Breaking news? It's a CAR CHASE! The saving grace of any afternoon: a high speed car chase somewhere in California. Even better, it was a bank robbery and they were soaring on some freeway throwing money out of the window! All three of us stopped and watched the screen. Danny started clapping in excitement. I tell ya, there is nothing that cheers me up more than some hella-sweet action that could wind up in disaster. This chase scene, which at first brought back fond memories of the O.J. chase, was going to be a good one too. There were three robbers speeding around in what appeared to be a Chrysler Pacifica, with about five cop cars following suit. What's even better is they were catching everything from helicopter cam! The driver of this car was pretty crazy at times. He was all over the 8 lane super highway, and then he would take an exit and head into the urban areas of LA, including Compton (represent!), and then would loop around and get back on the freeway going in the other direction. Even better, he utilized the car pool lane! Not only was that smart, but it was also considerate, since he did have more than two passengers. After about fifteen minutes of driving all over LA, and after evading the police which weren't very smart, they wound up in this suburban area. The robbers pulled the car onto some lady's lawn and pulled this weird Chinese fire drill. The woman, who was a large African American, was standing on the corner screaming at the robbers... and then screaming at the cops... and then screaming at everything. Two of the robbers gave up instantly. But the driver, who was a pretty hefty fellow wearing some O.G. football jersey, ran inside the house. There was a standoff for a little while, which was especially hilarious because this crazy woman was standing between the cops and the house, getting into the way of their pointed guns. Eventually the woman, whom I can only assume to be the driver's mother, talked the robber into coming out of the house and giving up. Although I must say, judging from what I saw of the robbers... they didn't plan this well at all. They were all wearing normal street clothes, no suits or black ties, and none of them had masks. They obviously didn't have a good safe house, and obviously didn't have enough man power. If more robbers would just do their research and watch some movies they might get away with it once in a while. But anyways... What excitement! I tell ya, great car chases only happen every once in a while, much like comets or the Olympics. And just like the previously mentioned events, car chases are not to be missed. My day has been brightened because of these ridiculous robbers and their poor planning. Thank you, young vigilantes. Thank you!\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I had been aware for several weeks that my car was badly in need of two new tires. However, being unemployed and horribly destitute - funny how the two seem to go together - I was forced to drive the car as is. It wasn't too bad. There was a slight thrill to every car trip. I never knew when the tires would blow, possibly sending my car out of control. It's these little things which keep my life interesting. Today, thanks to a monetary donation to the Keep James Afloat Fund from my Aunt, I finally was able to buy new tires. Of course, I went to the cheapest place I could think of, Wal-Mart Supercenter. (Just let me say right now that I don't want any 'How could you support the evil, unfeeling, corporate behemoth' comments. Maybe I'll fight injustice when I get the cash - maybe - and right now Wal-Mart's being quite helpful in keeping cash in my pocket. Long live the free market.) Upon arriving at the Wal-Mart Supercenter in lovely bucolic cranberry Pennsylvania. I was informed that it would take a little over an hour for them to get to and do the work on my car. So, I had little choice but to find a way to while away the time at Wal-Mart, there being nothing else within walking distance. This presented many problems, the chief of which being Malaise. I mean malaise in every sense of the word from boredom to the more existential sense of loss and dislocation. Wal-Mart is like a factory for these feelings, especially when I am alone there. Just looking at the people in Wal-Mart makes me feel more and more distant from my fellow man. How can I have anything in common with someone in a Dale Earnhardt jacket? How can I entertain myself for an entire hour? I could feel it. The malaise stalking through the aisles - a black cloud ready to envelope me. I had to keep my wits about me, stay sharp. I'm not ready to embrace my malaise. I don't care to become authentic whatever that means. I read it somewhere. I sat in the tire center waiting room for maybe 2 minutes. Just long enough to drink a cup of complimentary coffee. The waiting room was truly depressing: Colorless walls, torn vinyl chairs, 6 month old issues of better homes and gardens. One other guy was in there talking business on his cell phone. I secretly hoped he would make an inappropriate personal phone call, get in a fight with his wife or something. That would've entertained the sick part of me. But he only talked about tractor prices. I left the waiting room. The man never noted my entrance or exit. So, I was left adrift in the consumer wasteland. I moved quickly, one aisle to the next section to section, leaving whenever I felt the first shiver of boredom or despair. I took my blood pressure. It was good. I was proud of myself for a minute as I look over the deodorant for no good reason. I played with the camcorders aiming the one attached to the TV up my nose for all walking by to enjoy. I leafed through the latest copy of People. They listed the 50 most eligible bachelors. Some how I managed not to make the list again this year. They must not know I'm single. The guys starring in the upcoming film 'Harold And Kumar Go to White Castle' made the list, so I have my suspicions as to the viability of said list. I made a game out of taking the bouncy balls out of the bin and throwing them back into the top. I would throw them from all angles, from behind obstacles. I even tried it from an aisle over. I almost got thrown out from that. I browsed the hunting rifles, asking the clerk questions like \"Do you have anything that will make a deer's head explode?\" or \"Do you have anything for a guy trying to compensate for something, if you know what I mean?\" I almost got thrown out for that. I looked at the toys. I wished they had some out so I could give them a try but they didn't. So, I opened a bag of marbles anyway. I tried to pick up games with some kids until their parents pulled them away. I almost got thrown out for that. I pulled a bike off the rack to give it a test ride. I almost got thrown out for that. I climbed up on a display section to try out some of the exercise equipment. I almost got thrown out for that. I unfolded a camping chair and rolled out a cooler next to it. Then I chose a fishing pole from sporting goods and a goofy hat from the Men's section. I spent a good five minutes pretending to drink beer and fish. I almost got thrown out for that. Almost getting thrown out ended up being the key to my morning. Walking that fine line between harmless fun and public nuisance proved quite rewarding. Testing the limits of acceptable behavior at Wal-Mart, I think someone could write a thesis on this. It gave my morning just enough of an edge to ward off malaise. In the end, I got two new tires, at least 6 warnings, and no existential crisis. Sounds like a good morning to me.

It's based off of the actual term \"fog of war\" which is used to describe the thick fog of soot and gunpowder that fills the air after an intense battle. In videogames, it's used so you don't watch every move the enemy makes, hence creating a little surprise and challenge. I was thinking about this odd concept the other day, and I was wondering what would happen if everyone had \"fog of war\" in real life. No matter what time of day it is, no matter how good your glasses are, you can only see four feet in any one direction. Everything else just looks like a gray haze. Driving would be insane. I'm sure I would run over all sorts of animals, people, and rubber sports equipment that happens to wander in front of my Cougar. Parking would also be quite the bear, as my keen \"empty-spot-spotting eye\" would be totally useless. As would my \"hidden police officer spotting eye.\" That's two eyes that are gone with the wind! Then again, losing the cops would be a little easier (although I'm sure their range of sight would be a little longer than mine... law enforcement bonus). Walking around the mall would be a tad more enjoyable, since I wouldn't have to try as hard to avoid people I don't like. I only really have to panic when they get within a few feet of me. Muggers and Jehovah's Witnesses would be harder spot and defend against, on the other hand. But if you are going to go the way of these videogames (the ones I have in mind are Age of Empires and Dynasty Warriors) then you could also employ some scouts. Get the shmuck on a horse to go ahead and see if they have any ripe bananas at Giant Eagle. He will come back with the word, or he would even distract the Jehovah's long enough for me to run in there and get the delicious yellow fruits. Now that I think about it a bit, I'm glad that God turned off \"fog of war\" in the options menu when he was creating the world... well, you can probably see that my summer has been pretty boring thus far. I've got nothing better to do than think about videogames and watch MacGyver (who is freaking awesome, by the way.)\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I just got back from New York. That's right, the Big Apple, media capital of the world, center for culture, the city that never sleeps. At least that's what I've been told. I spent almost all my time at my grandparents house in the suburbs, and trust me, my grandparents house definitely DOES sleep. I would even go as far as saying it slumbers. It's half a step away from slipping into a coma. Bed time's 8:30 and it's strictly enforced. So, it's safe to say that I didn't exactly experience the thrill of New York City, despite being a mere stone's throw away. I missed the rush of the subway, the rhythm of the streets, the smell of the cabbies, but I wouldn't classify the trip as a loss. I learned all sorts of valuable things. Such as, it doesn't matter if you lose a ton of weight and everyone else thinks you look fantastic, an Italian grandmother will think you look awful. Apparently, despite being a healthy weight for my height, I'm dangerously thin. My grandmother kept looking at me as though I were a cancer patient. She would lurk in shadows waiting to pounce on me, brandishing a meatball sub like a shining sword of justice ready to plunge it into my unsuspecting mouth. I couldn't let my guard down for a second. I'd wake in the morning with inexplicable marinara on my chin and the taste of garlic on my tongue. I also came to the realization that I can no longer really talk to my grandparents, I can only talk around them. It's not that there's some horrible generation gap separating us. My grandparents simply can't hear anymore. I'm sure that over the course of a full week they only understood maybe 20 percent of what I said. I know they have a horribly inaccurate idea of what my life is like. I just got tired of correcting them. There's only so many times I can repeat something and there's only so loud I can talk. I just let them think what they like. It's easier on all of us. Here's an actual exchange: Grandma: So, you do plays? Me: Well, actually it's sketch comedy. G: What? M: Sketch comedy? G: What? M: SKETCH COMEDY! Like Saturday Night Live. G: You perform on Saturday? M: Yeah, whatever. (I nod emphatically in surrender) G: What part do you play? M: I play a lot of parts? G: What? M: MANY PARTS!! G: What? M: An officer in the Queens Navy. G: Oh, a barber, how nice. As if that wasn't bad enough, I had to put up with the most deafeningly loud television in the free world. My grandfather sits 4 feet from the television with what's left of his hair flapping to the decibels. And he still couldn't make half the stuff out. I couldn't escape the noise of the television. If you ever want to know what Bill O'Reilly is talking about all you need to do is be within a quarter mile radius of my grandparent's house. You can't miss it. Eighties rock band Scorpions could be playing a concert in the back yard and I would never know. So, while I missed out on the traditional New York experience. I feel that I got something much more important. I got a crash course on why I only visit my family once a year, and how much it sucks growing old.

Did you know they are from Belgium, like French Fries and those good waffles? Well, they are. In fact many well known cartoons are from there, the other popular one in the states was Tin Tin. You can get Smurf comics there in Flemish or Dutch. It's pretty cool. Anyways, I got to thinking about the smurfs. And I knew that the smart one that made stuff was Handy Smurf, but I recalled one that wore glassesm which is of course the international sign for smarts. But I knew it wasn't Handy, who wore a pencil behind the ear. So, I knew I could turn to the source of all information useless: the internet. I had faith in the fact that some person with nothing better to do had created a website that listed, with pictures, all of the smurfs. So I used google and put in Smurf List, and sure enough, there was such a list, and sublists under it. I quickly found that Brainy smurf was the one of which I was thinking. Glasses and a snooty attitude, like an associate professor. So while some may think that the internet is good for school, which it isn't, and some may think it's only good for porn searchs, which it is. I also argue that there is a lot of useless crap out there to be known. And people seem to have webpages for it, and they pay for them and keep them updated.

Well I had so much fun that I decided I wanted to throw my own party this July. There is a national party for the president day on Thursday, July 15th, and anyone involved will get a sweet conference call with VP Dick Cheney himself! It's a sweet deal. The reason I wanted to throw one, was basically because of what I witnessed at the first party I went to. It was a fine party, very respectable, but it was definitely geared towards adults. Me, Leroy and Teddy were the youngest guys there. So I figured why not have a party aimed at younger folks, college kids and folks in their twenties. A real \"party\" filled with loud music (Andrew W. K., not Toby Keith), a light atmosphere with some real humor and good times. Instead of having it at a fancy hotel, I'm having it at a brand new coffee house in Rochester, PA. Instead of hiring a DJ to play stereotypical Republican country music, I'm bringing my Mac and playing some true party music (regardless of affiliation). (Assuming all goes to plan) We are going to have a conference call from the vice prez, a video tape from the president, and some other sweet activities and speeches. This isn't to say that only republicans are invited.

They are superior to us simple folk in every conceivable way. They are better looking. They are richer. They live in unnecessary, palatial 'cribs'. They are sweeter smelling. They have entire television shows devoted to their fabulous lives. They are more well spoken. They are more intelligent. And, this must be remembered at all times above all else, their opinions are worth more than the those of the rest of us slack jawed, hamburger helper eating yokels. So, in these fractured, contentious times let us all turn to the great oracle of Hollywood to gain guidance and understanding. They will tell us everything we will ever need to know, from what to wear to who to vote for. They will do all the thinking for the poor 'little people' of our nation. This is a good thing since regular people have such a hard time thinking. We'd all be much happier not thinking at all. After all, thinking gives regular people headaches, and we always make such a mess of ideas. Left to our devices we might do totally illogical things, like read books, express ourselves, or even vote for whoever we want. What a nightmare. Thank you Hollywood for sweet, sweet mind-numbing television to give celebrities a forum to tell us useless worms how the world works. Now, I don't want to hear any complaints. That's just the last vestiges of your independent, but fatally flawed thought talking. Just let it slip away. Don't question celebrities. They're right. They have to be. They're celebrities. I know to us, the great unwashed masses, it may seem odd that we value someone's opinion simply because they happen to be famous and they happen to be famous simply because they are attractive, or can read someone else's words on cue, or because they have a pleasant voice. But it simply doesn't matter why someone's famous. As long as someone is famous they become our moral and intellectual superiors. That's just the way the world works. It's God's plan. Celebrities are the center of our world. We should all just recognize this and genuflect. Now, if you'll excuse me. I have to watch E!.

It was a dumb thing to do, but the circumstances under which I saw the film made sense at the time (although they are certainly no excuse). I had a bevy of free tickets for the Destinta theater out in Bridgeville, and they expired last week, so I had to go and use them up... I mainly saw movies that I had already seen, like \"The Punisher\" and \"Shrek 2\" and then, in a move that I can only attribute to a moment of weakness, poor timing, peer pressure, and desperation, I saw \"Soul Plane.\" So far, I've gotten the same reaction from everyone I've admitted this to: \"Oh God, what were you thinking?!\" And the answer is \"I have no clue.\" The whole movie looked more like a train wreck from a mile away. Have you seen the trailer? It looked absolutely terrible... and I assure you, if you make the same mistake I did and actually take the time to watch the movie, your guess about the movie will be proven. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And while I could sit here and critique this movie like I would any film, wasting time on the technical flaws of the movie would be pointless. Just thinking about the content of this film would make anyone, of any race, just shake their heads. In what had the potential to be the \"soulful\" version of the comedy classic \"Airplane!\", \"Soul Plane\" is nothing more than a 90 minute MTV-stereotyped, racially-charged, mess of a film that makes me wish I had the comforting arm of TV's George Lopez to cry on... that's pretty bad. Let me start by talking about what goes on in the movie. There is this giant purple plane with hydraulics (which is probably one of the few cool aspects of the movie) and it's flying with a bunch of stereotypes... and Tom Arnold. I don't understand how any race could NOT be offended by this movie. There is one Arab on the plane, and of course there are a few 9-11 jokes to go along with him. There are four white people on the plane, they have the last name of \"Honkey\" and they are coming home from a vacation to \"Crackerland.\" Come on now... and then of course the plane is filled with African Americans. And for once I agree with Spike Lee and his joints-a-plenty. This movie is most offensive towards blacks! Sure there were a few times throughout the movie that I chuckled at what was going on on screen. Perhaps it is just the overall faux pas nature of this racist piece of cinema (the lower class section of the plane gets a piece of Popeye's fried chicken for their in-flight meal), afterwards I felt a little weird about the whole movie. What kind of audience are they making this for? Well I can tell you. It was made for the pop-culture-loving teens of this day and age. And they are eating it up. There is a reason why this awful movie is number 5 across the nation. It's the same reason that they are making a movie called \"Harold and Kumar go to White Castle\" and a movie called \"The Cook Out.\" Because America loves dumb shit. America loves stereotypes and humor that, when attached using electrodes to a bowl of green Jello, barely causes ripples. Now I saw this movie because I had a free ticket, and so technically they didn't make any money off of me and my buddies. But someone out there is seeing this movie, and it's not good for America or Hollywood (who is going to do nothing but continue to make this kind of crap). So if anyone asks... I saw Soul Plane to further my knowledge of cultural studies.

Perhaps those words would be \"gorilla tactics\" or \"grassroots effort\" or maybe even \"word of mouth.\" And then there is something to be said for the Beaver County Times' treatment of the Cellar Dwellers' effort. Unfortunately, those words are a little too inappropriate for me to type on this very blog. Anyone who lives in Beaver County knows the Times' reputation for poor reporting, a strong reliance on AP news stories, a strong liberal slant, and a lot of typos. You don't need me to complain about that. And that's not to say that they don't have good people working for them. Dave Smith is an exemplary entertainment writer, and at one point in time they had John Dessler, one of my inspirations for choosing graphic design. However, they have managed to give the Cellar Dwellers the good ol' one, two, screw at some point for almost every one of our shows for the past few months. It's at the point now, where I recommend that our fans NOT look for our shows in there because the listing is going to be wrong regardless. Two weeks ago, we were doing an all-improv show at Thursdays Restaurant in Bridgewater. I am the guy in charge of making the fliers, press releases, and other promotional material for the group. I always make sure the press releases are perfect, and that there is no way to confuse our location, show dates or times. And yet, somehow the BCT thought we were at Dockers doing improv. We've never, in our troupe's seven year history, done a show at Dockers. But I guess that's better than nothing. Sometimes they just don't print a press release I send them, even when it's on time. And of course I call them and let them know they are wrong every chance I get. And yet, there isn't too much we can do, since it's a free service they, and all newspapers, provide. We just have to take what we can get. It was their screw-up today that has sent me over the edge. Learning that they can barely understand press releases printed clearly in either Courier New or Times New Roman, I faxed them the Godzillas and Generals release TWICE, both times well before the deadline for this weekend's issue. And yet somehow, through some mysterious voodoo curse or insistence on using \"copy paste\" methods, they have managed to screw the Cellar Dwellers yet again. Because fresh in today's Weekender, under the comedy section (I also insist on us being placed in the Theater Section but comedy is fine too... as long as we don't wind up under Etc.), it clearly says that our show is SATURDAY, aka TOMORROW. It also says that it's scene-based improv. I just have one web-jargon abbreviation to use right now: WTF. Apparently, the BCT's A.D.H.D. has gotten the best of them again, and they just make these insane mistakes without even knowing it. The Beaver County Times has a responsibility to their readers, advertisers, and the Arts in Beaver County to get these listings correct the first time around. No amount of \"corrections\" the day after will fill the seats. And for the Dwellers, the BCT is the best way for us to really get the word out about our shows. This isn't to say that you should totally ignore what they print, because 70% of the time its probably right. But I insist that if you see a Dweller listing, you check out the website, or look for a flier, or just go and find out. Our fliers and website are always correct. If you want something done right, you do it yourself. But it's apparent that when you have to rely on others, you only get what you want when you are a paying customer. I guess they won't get it right until we finally make the cover of the weekender. Of course, as long as there are Emmy award nominations, we don't stand a chance.

In my travels I have encountered myriad wondrous and astounding things, bad weather, scary hitch hikers, an Elvis impersonator truck driver, but I have encountered only one object which completely mystifies me. Off of route 488, somewhere between Elwood City and Portersville, there stands a statue, maybe four foot tall, of a little Mexican leading a donkey. Alone in a small clearing, with absolutely no explanation, this Mexican is forever caught in the act of leading his donkey toward God-only-knows where. It's almost as though, this Mexican along with his donkey had sprung forth from the Earth whole. It stands there implacable, as mysterious as Stonehenge, as terrifying as an Easter Island head. I have the strangest sensation that no human mind or hand played any part in its construction. This statue exist on a plane beyond human comprehension. At least it exist beyond my own comprehension, which is - I am forced to admit - quite limited. I do have my theories. I have several, they bubble up from the percolator of my mind. I think that some ancient culture of Lawrence County could have used this statue as a calendar or possibly it held some astrological purpose. It could have fallen from space, like David Bowie did in the 70's. It could be a gift to us from the mole people who live thousands of feet beneath the Earth. My favorite explanation is that it is an idol from a long dead religion - the Valdezians. The Valdezians worshipped all things coffee - mugs, plastic stirrers, half and half, pretentious bastards at Starbucks - and this is an idol to their chief god - Juan Valdez, the bringer of the coffee. Sure I have no proof of this, but I think if I just believe in it enough it just might become so. One of these days - when I am not driving home at some obscene time of night or running late - I will stop my car and take a closer look at this marvel of ancient engineering. If I ever have anyone else with me and a camera handy I'll take a picture with it. I'd like one with me riding the donkey in my fancy Cellar Dweller T-shirt. I just hope that I don't upset Valdez.

Chris went out and got all of these books and whatnot and took this sucker on. Of course, the two of us (along with any other Dweller who may join us) sitting in a cafe with Chris' 17-inch HP laptop aren't the most productive around. But productivity with this website isn't always our number one priority, fun is. Because if fun ain't being had, then why be had at all. That's what I say... sometimes.

All things relevant to the life of two single working-guys fresh outta high school. My coffee intake has nearly doubled thanks to working on this website. The advantage, and the main reason, of doing most of the work at the cafe is because we get a bottomless cup of coffee. So our laps are scalded by the end of the day. No, so we get all of the coffee we can muster! Trust me, I drink alot of coffee. Usually it's the dark roast (which can be anything from Kenyan, Columbian, and Cuban to J.P.

Chris likes to get a carmel coffee thing (some of the girls there make it with whipped cream, while others skimp on the extras and just give him the coffee) and then he chases that down with some of the normal coffees. I usually go to the bathroom like three times while we are there (which is normally from 3:30 until they close at 5:30). It would help alot more if that place had a wireless internet connection like the Copper Dog does.

(Yes, I am aware that the words C-SPAN and interesting do not generally appear together in any context, but technically this was C-SPAN2.) They were airing a meeting of a focus group from somewhere in Ohio. (OK, I admit this still doesn't sound interesting, but bare with me.) So, there were about 9 people in a non-descript meeting room of some sort being quizzed by a weasily, condescending focusmeister. (Well, maybe this is only interesting to me, but I'm forging ahead anyway.) This focusmeister - sorry about the overly technical jargon - was asking all sorts of questions about Bush and Kerry to this rag tag assembly of housewives, retirees, and guys with goatees. This was so fascinating to me because this was a window into the strange and arcane tools used by candidates to gain political office. No doubt, Bush, Kerry, and their people use focus groups such as this to tailor their platforms, speeches, and such. After viewing this focus group, I only have one thing to say about the state of the democratic process in our country: It is totally screwed up. If Bush and Kerry are listening to people like this, God help us all. These people are complete idiots. They almost all complained that both candidates seem to avoid really confronting theissues, but what do you expect when they hear from focus groups like this is that Bush supporters like him for his 'strength and confidence' whileKerry supporters think he's 'careful and thoughtful'. Why would the candidates deal with the issues, when focus groups are telling them that they're more interested in their images? Then, there were the questions coming from the focusmeister. There was, of course, the old ' who looks more presidential?' chestnut. The correct answer to this is: who cares? It doesn't matter who looks more presidential. Neither Bush nor Kerry does. One has a face that looks like it's melting. The other's face appears to be constantly sucked toward some midpoint, maybe around his nose. (Curiously enough, if you crossed Bush with Kerry, you'd get one normal looking person.) Plus, it doesn't really matter who looks more presidential. It doesn't even matter who acts more presidential. The only question that matters is who would make the better president. Plus, asking who's more presidential between two candidates is akin to asking which is more tree-like: a pine cone or a buckeye. Both have the capability to be a tree, and once a tree, it becomes de facto tree like. It can be nothing but tree like, since it is, after all, a tree. The candidate who becomes president becomes presidential simply by being president, since by definition he can not be otherwise. The questions from the focusmeister just kept getting stranger and stranger. At one point he asked, \"If John Edwards was a family member what family member would he be and why?\" Almost everyone answered Uncle - one guycryptically answered 'an uncle from the coast' with out giving any explanation. Again, no one gave the correct answer which would be to point out that the question is stupid and not worthy of a serious answer - although, if forced to answer I'd have to say Uncle Joey since Edwards, much like Uncle Joey, is just a little too eager to please. At about this point my attention began to stray from the focus group on television. I began to wonder why the focusmeister didn't just go whole hog and continue asking more and more bizarre questions. It wouldmake forbetter television and be just as useful to society to just screw with the people, just ask off the wall crap, dare someone to call you on the questions. As a matter of fact, I have a list of questions I would just love to ask a focus group. Here's just a few: If Dick Cheney were a candy bar, what kind would he be and why? - Hopefully this question would lead to a Bush supporter saying something like: \"M's because he may have a hard shell, but deep down I think he's a real sweety.\" To which a Kerry supporter would respond: \"Technically MM's aren't candy bars , nitwit.\" This would lead to loud shouting and maybe fisticuffs, which would make for really good television. If you could ride one ride at the carnival with John Kerry, which would it be and why? - The correct answer is his jowls. If John Edwards ran one attraction at this carnival, which would it be and why? -Hopefully someone would say: \"None, he'd set up a lawyer booth to sue when one of the rides comes crashing down.\" Which word better describes George Bush: lava or magma? - Even I'm mystified by this question and I came up with it. Which Olsen Twin are you more attracted to? - Just to see if everyone's still awake. If Dick Cheney could have dinner with any person, living or dead, who would it be and why? - A good cardiologist for obvious reasons. Is John Edwards more of a Dick York or a Dick Sergeant?- Either way, he's still second banana. True or false: George Bush totally rules at pack man. - Who knows? He might. You've been invited to John Kerry's birthday party, what do you bring as a gift? - I don't know. What do you get the man who married the woman who has everything? See now wouldn't this be fun. I think that I may have found my calling. I should run focus groups. I'd be just as useful, but at least twice as entertaining as the guys they have running them now. All I'd really need to do is keep a straight face, and act like I know what I'm doing. That doesn't sound hard at all. How do you think I got through college?

I'm one to just sit down and click away, but I definitely have it on in the background, as my summer days grind away in the most boring fashion available to me. And there are one group of commercials that not only succeed in making me laugh every time, but also intrigue me far more than they should. These commercials are for entrepreneurial (a word SHU seems to love for some reason) credit machines that do all the work and give you all the cash. Not only are they perfect for the wanna-be millionare inside of us all, but they also require us to do nothing but suck in the sweet sweet cash! You may have seen the commercials yourself. These wonder machines include ATM machines in fast food chains, internet access points, wireless hotspots, and movie rental machines. That's right, you can rent movies... from a vending machine. Apparently, these machines do nothing but rake in the dough. All you do is pick a location, set up the machine, and then stop by every once in a while to get your loot. It begs the question, \"Why aren't we all doing this?! Why am I going to college? Why am I even working on graphic design, when all I have to do is get a key, walk down to my giant movie-renting-machine and get my loot?\" This operation is literally the deus ex machina that will come and end my working career (which has been lazy as best thanks to my Trib job). What's even better about all of this, is the lifestyle I will have once I get my machines. According to the commercials, I will become an old man with a full head of gray hair. I will get to wear Hawaiian shirts while sitting by a huge pool, and have an attractive girl in a bikini look over my shoulder as I monitor my money from an old Apple iBook! Holy shit! This is the life of a king, I tell you... a king! I know this is exactly how Bill Gates and Ted Turner live. I just know it. And soon, I shall be with them... well, not WITH them, but in the same class as them. Getting taxed less (hopefully) than the average man, but instead of giving out more jobs like most billionaires, I will make my billions from the machine. Perhaps I will hire someone to go around and pick up the money for me... a small Cuban boy. That way I won't look like an American jerk. I'm giving back to the community, and letting Pepe' get some exercise. And of course, thanks to Global Link (the enigmatic company behind these marvelous machines) and my sex-slave Adonna, I will be the mysterious billionaire that I always strived to be. I will have no choice but to become a super villain, hiring thousands of nameless henchmen, and that guy with the question mark suit who is always being chased by the feds, and I will take over the world in my zeppelin. That's right... a zeppelin. But there is just one loose end that needs tied up... and that is of this mysterious video rental machine. I just don't get it. Somehow the movie titles will be updated (I'm assuming by one of my drones) and somehow people are going to return these things? If they don't, Pepe' will have to break their legs. But really, is this more convenient than going to Hollywood Video or Blockbuster? No matter, money will come regardless! If you too are interested in the exciting business of owning a machine that takes money from people, contact urlLink Global Link . They have a helpful website filled with confusing words and charts depicting nonsense! It's like the website says: \"Global Link was launched in 1996 with a simple and yet challenging vision: to look at the world from the desktop of the buy-side and to create efficiencies through the intelligent application of technology to real-world business needs for information, liquidity access, and workflow improvements.

Hell yes...\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "By most accounts - some could even argue by all accounts - my life is far from successful. My problems are many and varied. I am with out gainful employment. My hairline is receding. I live with my parents. I have no luck with women - this, of course, could be a result of the rest of my problems. I am very clumsy, often annoying, and love bad hair bands of the 1980's - however, I can't stand good hair bands of the 1980's, although I can't say I've ever heard of any. Now, I am aware that I do have some good qualities. Those with an incredible gift of perception may even be able to notice some of them. I am fairly well read, more or less intelligent and occasionally amusing. I'm a good listener, in many ways unselfconscious, and I make great omelets. Also, I love bad hair bands of the 1980's. My major problem, I have decided, is that I lack a certain force of will, strength of commitment, courage, intestinal fortitude, balls, etc. I live too much of my life inside of my own head. I lack the strength, desire, or bravery to move ideas out of the intellectual realm and into the physical, everyday realm. I cannot realize my full potential, because - through either fear or apathy - I cannot make myself fully responsive to the world at large. I need to move beyond myself. Take the strength of my mind and apply it to the world. I need to develop my intellectual and social courage in much the same way I have developed my body from flabby to almost ok. I need to gain some strength. I need machismo. I need to jump out of my seat, run out into the street with the crazed look of a blind man who can suddenly see. I need to experience and I need to do. I need to grab life by the lapels, shake it around, and generally make it my woman. In short, I need a mustache. Ah, yes, the mustache: the facial hair of the man of action. Mustaches practically breath decisiveness. Quick, think of the mustache. Who comes to mind? Clark Gable. Magnum PI. Rollie Fingers. Cowboys. Every hero of every 70's cop movie or television show. Barber shop quartets. Porn stars. Groucho Marx. Every state trouper. All men of action. Men who know who they are, know what they want, and get it. That is the power of the mustache. So, is it any wonder that I, weak willed as I am, long for a mustache, would treasure a mustache, would comb it thrice daily, would wax the ends into intricate curly-Q's. I quake with desire for a mustache. I have started growing one. I picture it in my minds eye, thick and full, flowing down the corners of my mouth, covering my upper lip in a luxurious facial hair canopy of manhood. I see myself on job interviews, employers falling all over themselves to have me be a part of their company. \"By George,\" they'll say, \"just take a gander at that magnificent mustache. We must employ that man. Quick get the benefits package together.\" I can see myself at the bars and the clubs. I can see the women swooning over me. \"By George,\" they'll say, \"look at that mustache. He is clearly more man than the rest of these bare lipped fools. Quick, we must go lavish feminine attention upon him.\" I am growing my mustache. It is currently little more than stubble at the moment. I am sure that I will have to withstand the horrible, 'I think a caterpillar died on your upper lip' stage of mustache growth, the stage which most men cannot progress past. I know that some people are going to sneer and mock my mustache. \"By George,\" they'll say, \"You look like a pervert (or a pedaphile, or a member of the village people, or Teddy Roosevelt).\" I can handle this. I will simply laugh it off, because I know - deep down I just know - that mustaches are kick ass, and those losers are only jealous of the power and the majesty that is the mustache. I also know that some people are skeptical. Not so much toward the power of the mustache - which is undeniable - but toward my ability to handle responsibly the greatness of the mustache. These people may argue that you must first have the mustache attitude then the mustache follows naturally. That to grow the mustache and then hope for the attitude is a fools errand. \"By George,\" they are probably saying, \"this chap's mustache will surely wither and die upon his lip. The attitude predicates the mustache, not vice verse.\" Now, this is a very interesting question. It has a number of philosophical facets dealing as it does with issues of causality, individuality, and personality. So, I must be careful in addressing this objection. However, I feel that I am up to the challenge. So, to these people I say: EAT IT!! I'm growing a mustache and that's all there is to it. The mustache is going to be kick ass and so am I. If you losers can't handle that, you better shut up and get out of my way. Because, by George, I'm growing a mustache and I'm coming through. There is no stopping me now. Nothing can stand in the way of the mustache. Nothing......Unless, of course, my mom doesn't like it. Shalom\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "My brother has been feeding me these ridiculous-but-true facts all day now (I am guessing he was literally saving them for a rainy day)... and there was one that really stuck out in my mind. That of the British-Zanzibar War, the shortest war in history. So I decided to google this so-called war to find out more about it. What I found was an intriguing journal entry written by the incredibly mysterious Sultan of Zanzibar. What follows is a series of fateful entries written on the day of the war. August 22, 6am Dearest Journal, today I have been appointed the SULTAN of ZANZIBAR! How sweet is that? Of course, given the circumstances of my appointment, I must take this job with merely a grin instead of a full-blown crescent moon smile. My father, the long-time Sultan Tad Storkensburg, died last night of irritable bowel syndrome. I think there was something in his Zanzibarian Burger that really disagreed with him. Alas, I mourn my father's gruesome and disgusting death, and I welcome my new title of Sultan! It's so much cooler than \"Saltine.\" My first act as Sultan is to stand up to those awful Brits. The Brits and the Germans have been fighting over my island for years now, and I'm damn sick and tired of it. The Brits keep wanting this island so they can move into Africa, the Germans want this island so they can put a Volkswagon factory on it. Zanzibar is my homeland, as obscure and ridiculous as that sounds, and I will not let it slip into the hands of the straightbacks from the north! So, after speaking with Germany, they've decided to back me up as I stand up to the Brits. My dad had good relations with those limey bastards for years, but now that he's out of the way I'm gonna kick some ass! August 22, 1896 9am Dearest journal, I just declared war on the Brits. I know what you're thinking... I'm in office for three hours and I already declared war on the biggest nation in the world. Maybe I was a little hasty, but I stand by my decision. I declared war about twenty minutes ago, and I'm ready for whatever they are going to throw at me! I have 2,500 Arab troops ready and willing to be slaughtered for the well-being of Zanzibar. I also have this really boss gold cannon from 1658. Back in the day, I hear, we used to use this cannon for everything... we even fought off the Egyptians or something. But ever since then it's been sitting in front of the Zanzibarian Court House just collecting dust. I also got this sweet old ship... it's like a wooden viking boat. Only it's not a viking boat because vikings didn't come down here... often. August 22, 1896 9:05am Dear J-Dog, The British are pretty much surrounding the island with their large-ass ships. Any normal Sultan would be thinking he had made a mistake, but I know I'm doing the right thing. I will be the Sultan to end all Sultans! Let it be known that Reggie Storkensburg, The Sultan of Zanzibar, was the most courageous leader ever. With the exception of Jesus. Anyways, right now we are sort of waiting... my troops are just sitting on the beaches playing card games and volleyball and the British keep cocking their rifles at us. I hope something happens pretty soon, I have a tennis date with the Czar of Uberbeckingstand at noon. Did I spell his country right? Oh well, no one's gonna read this anyways. August 22, 1896 9:15am Shit! Snap! Dag! Holy flaming crap! The Brits have decided to start shooting cannon balls at my island! One shot took out 500 of my troops, who were in the middle of a round robin volleyball tournament on the north shore! I have decided to bring out my golden cannon, which I have named \"Fat Man.\" I have three cannon balls, which I have named \"Little Boy.\" Those Brits are going to have some trouble coming there way as soon as Fat Man shoots the Little Boys! August 22, 1896 9:25am This isn't going at all like I had planned. August 22, 1896 9:35am Okay, okay, okay, all of my troops are dead. That's what I get for hiring all these Arabs to do the job... everyone knows Arabs can't swim! My viking ship has been totally destroyed, even worse they spray painted a giant space gun on the side of it before they set it on fire. Those British sure do know how to make you feel stupid. Although I must stay that they aren't nearly as polite as everyone thinks. Let's just hope my cannon holds out! August 22, 1896 9:37am Murphy's Law kicked in... my uber-boss cannon just burst into flames! It's made of gold, how did this happen?! August 22, 1896 9:45am Dear Journal, you are now looking at the former Sultan of Zanzibar... that's right. I gave up. I couldn't take it anymore! The Brits had me backed up against the wall here. And so after 45 minutes of being pummeled by these jerks, I gave up. I kinda forgot that my population consisted of just 2,500 Arabs, and since they were all dead now... I figured I might as well cut my losses and live to rule another day. Luckily, my sausage-welding friends from Middle Europe, let me stay at their consulate. Those Germans are alright, ya know? I mean, they really know what they are doing, and I wouldn't be surprised if they really make a difference in the world. I'd stake my Sultan reputation on it. Anyways, goodbye my lovely journal... the Germans won't allow me to bring this into the consulate, so I must leave it on this board and float it out to sea. Maybe someday those Brits will find it and see all of the stuff I said about em. Won't they feel bad! -33- Wow. That Sultan was a cool dude.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Those of you who keep up with the news - I know you're out there somewhere - will most likely remember the big story about the Super Strong Mutant German Boy a few weeks back. For those of you who only get your news from 'Entertainment Tonight' - I know you're out there everywhere - allow me to enlighten you. It was recently revealed that a boy in Germany (I want to say he's currently 5 years old) was born with a genetic mutation - yes, I said genetic mutation - which has caused him to grow muscles at a prodigious, unnatural rate. He can already lift more weight than some full grown adults. He could probably lift two Mary-Kate Olsens straight over his head, but only one and a half Ashley Olsens. So, the Super Strong Mutant Boy - who I will from this point on refer to as SSMG boy, or better yet, as SSMuG Boy, or even better still, smug boy - being a true genetic freak, was paraded around the news for attention. Now that a few weeks have gone by and most of the news has moved on to new stories, something about smug boy still bothers me. No, it's not that there's a five year old out there who can kick my ass. I've been getting my ass kicked by five year olds for years. It no longer bothers me. What bothers me is how the whole thing was covered. It was seen as a medical, scientific miracle. Something to be studied. Maybe this boy's DNA could unlock keys to healing those with debilitating diseases, or lead to a safer alternative to steroid therapy. While this is all good and wonderful, I can't help thinking the news media has missed the main story. This kid is a genetic mutant - a MUTANT. Doesn't anyone understand what this means? The age of the X-Men could very well be upon us. This kid could be a member of the first generation of genuine, real super heroes and super villains. Smug boy's a German so, obviously, he's destined to be a super villain. This is huge, and the news media completely dropped the ball. We could be heading toward a war of humans vs. Mutants, or humans and good mutants vs. evil mutants, or good humans/mutants vs. evil humans/mutants, or, most frightening yet, everybody vs. evil shepherds. This could be the most dynamic time in human history as super powerful mutants with a proclivity toward spandex rise to power. Still, I don't want to rush to any judgment. That's why I didn't write this post weeks ago when the story was fresh. I needed to take some time and see if I could confirm my suspicions. If the age of the X-men is truly upon us, then other mutants must be out there within a generation or two of smug boy. Surely, at least some of these people are already adults and have used their powers to move into a position of power and fame. All I need is to use my keen power of perception and my television remote to weed them out. I want everyone to sit down. It is time for me to announce my findings. After days of study including extensive reading, monitoring of television broadcast, and three square meals a day, I have determined that the age of the mutant is indeed upon us. In fact, it is much more extensive than I first suspected. My first tip was Ken Jennings. Ken Jennings, for those of you not in the know, is the man who has been Jeopardy champion for almost 30 days. I've been monitoring him with much interest. He is almost unbeatable. His trivial knowledge and thumb reflexes are clearly superior to the average man's. Clearly, Ken Jennings is a mutant who was born with an abnormally large Trivial Cortex - the part of your brain set aside for facts on the court of King Edward II and other such tid bits - as well as genetically advanced thumbflexes - sorry about the technical terminology; it's unavoidable. So, now the only remaining question is whether or not Ken Jennings is a super hero or a super villain. Let's look at the facts: ken Jennings is Super intelligent, kind of weasely looking, and Mormon. Clearly, he's a super villain. Also, there's Saddam Hussein. He's been in the news a lot due to his trial in which he has exhibited mutant like abilities. In the face of a criminal court, with a possible death penalty in the mix, Saddam had the guts to defend his actions. He even claimed to still be the president of Iraq. Clearly, Saddam has been born with large - unnaturally, mutantly large - balls. Good thing we already have him in custody. Also, the whole genocidal mad man thing kind of indicates he just might be a super villain, not a super hero. So, I found 3 mutants, then last night I hit the motherlode: VH1's 'I love the 90's'. I'm sure everyone's familiar with the the VH1 specials. You may think they're harmless or you may think they're annoying, but - after my discovery - everyone's going to find them terrifying. All the commentators on 'I love the 90's' are mutants. Every last one of them from the annoying guy from 'Talk Soup' to the annoying guy from 'Ed'. This is the first evidence I have found of a conglomerate of mutants. Not only are they all mutants, they're all mutants in the same way. They have all been born with the uncanny - that's right, uncanny - ability to maintain a career in entertainment with no discernible talent. Clearly, all these people were born with a genetically advanced Zsa Zsa gland - or what scientist often refer to today as the Keanu/Shore gland. This gland controls dumb luck and the ability to be on television with nothing to say. Most frightening of all, these celebrity mutants are all super villains. It's obvious. They don't have an airplane. All teams of super heroes have a tricked out plane. In absence of a plane, it becomes obvious that this mutant team is truly evil. Finally, I feel the need to take a closer look at myself. What if I am a mutant? It's worth a look. Let's see. I'm not super strong. I have decent hearing, but not mutant hearing. I have bad eyesight. My sense of smell is average. I can't shoot any kind of laser from my eyes. When I touch other people the only thing that happens is I get slapped. After jumping off my garage I've confirmed that I can't fly. My bones do break. I'm balding. I'm unemployed. I live with my parents. I have no real drive to accomplish anything in my life... Oh, my god... I am a mutant. Can't you see? I've been born with a genetically superior apathymous. I have powers of apathy far beyond that of the average person. The best part, I'm not a super hero or a super villain. You actually have to care to be labeled either of those. I've been born with the only great power which does not come with great responsibility. I can live with that...I guess...whatever. Shalom\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Tomorrow I turn the ripe old age of 19... a year that just doesn't seem as special as the past three. Think back, have you ever heard anyone say, \"I can't wait to turn 19!\" It's the minor rift after the big waves caused by birthdays 16-18. These milestones, to which like all kids, have always held things that I have always looked forwards to. When you turn 16, you can drive; when you turn 17, you can see R-Rated movies; when you turn 18, you can do all sorts of things; but when you turn 19... well. Turning 19 not only fails to unlock any new abilities (if you want to look at this like it's a videogame) but it also leaves you, at least in my family, poor and lonely. In my family, you have birthday parties until you are 12, and you get presents from your relatives until you are 18. After that you are considered an \"adult\" and subject to moneyless cards, a birthday dinner and a pat on the back. That isn't to say I'm some sort of ungrateful punk... but knowing that nothing special is happening makes my birthday, once a sacred event that balanced my year with Christmas, is now a holiday about as important as Arbor Day or Boxing Day in Canada. They (society?) really should have spaced out everything you can do when you turn 18. Is it really necessary to make the age of 18 such a gateway to the world, when 19 and 20 have absolutely nothing special going on. Since turning 18, I've been able to drive after midnight , buy lottery tickets, get into strip clubs, buy pornography, purchase tobacco products, drink and gamble on international waters, drive out of state, and date people only older than 18 (which made for a few laughs when I was dating Aubrey). But aside from driving out of state and driving past 11PM, I haven't really taken advantage of my 18 year old status. So why not push the porn related abilities back to 20, and the lottery tickets and tobacco back until I'm 19. Then I have something to look forward to each year, although that 20th birthday would be sort of weird. That, or they can just make other things off limits, and have them be available to me after I turn 19. Like purchasing computer parts. You don't really need to do dabble with the inner workings of your computer until you are out of high school. Ban eating peas until you are 19, so you are mature enough not to scatter them all over your plate and dining room floor. You also shouldn't be allowed to become a pop idol until you are 19, nor are you allowed to become a sex symbol until that time (I've decided on waiting until I'm 25 to do either of those things... personal rule.) And so by now you should be feeling pretty bad for me and my pitiful age of 19... but don't! My birthday is actually going to be a good day, I assure you! I have decided to overcome adversity and ignore the fact that I can't do anything new during my 19th year on this earth. So instead I am getting fed all day. Tomorrow I plan on waking up, pouring some water on the floor for my homies, and heading over to my beloved Aunt's apartment for french toast. Then it's off to lunch with a friend... and then coffee with another friend. No sooner will I arrive home will I be eating some more, this time it's my birthday dinner cooked by Mom. So if anything, maybe I will gain some weight the day I turn 19! I'm very thankful for my 19 years, and I'm only sort of thankful for looking like I've only been around for 13 years. But hey, at least now I can buy lottery tickets and eat peas!\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Today more than one bird flew into the screen that I have in my bedroom window. My room is not that interesting, nor does it look appealing to birds (no worms or bird porn). Now I realize I've blogged a lot, so that means I'm bored and need a real job, just like my mom keeps telling me. If there is anyone out there who knows about birds, maybe they can tell me why birds seem to flock to the roof of my front porch. It's very strange. I live in the middle house of five row houses. But the birds hang out on the edge of the roof of my roof only. All the roofs are red. They all look the same. In fact, they are all beveled the same, so what makes my roof different? I know my house is a party house. It's had a history of good parties, not least of which was our halloween party last year. So maybe there's a good bird vibe on the porch roof. The thing that kinda creeps me out is the fact that birds come from all over the neighborhood to do it on our roof. I'm serious! I just noticed something different about our roof. Since we're in the middle, we have a little wooden knob sticking up in the center. And I just remembered seeing birds hanging out there a lot. Maybe that piece of wood is like the bird throne. And whoever sits on it gets all the chicks...literally. Now I'm no ornithilogical Dr. Ruth, but maybe there's something to that place on our roof. I don't watch the birds having sex, but on more than one occasion, I've been awakened to loud bird noises close to my head and I slowly open my eyes to witness hot heavy freaky bird lovin' right on my roof. That's not as bad as the night my bed was right by the window and my head was right by the window. I heard a noise and turned over and I was looking a racoon square in the face. We both screamed and he took off. I see birds come over and chirp and then other birds join it and the sex is on! I wish there was a human equivilent to saying \"Hey, I'm on the bird throne, come over here so I can do you.\" Life would be a lot simpler.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Now, most of my blogs are indeed not funny, just sort of ranting. Well this one is no different. I have a friend that went back to school. He's a little older than me and last night at about 1 AM we had a discussion on the computer about politics. He went to an \"We hate Bush\" kind of rally in Oakland. He said I would have not liked it since I was \"one of those..you know Rs.\" (republicans, which seems to now be the party of the people strangely enough from what the news says. They want to give the power to you instead of taking it and letting decisions be made by the government, cause apparently the democrats know what I need more than I do! But that\u2019s another argument) He then proceeded to say that the whole system needs to be changed. I was like \"What? What? What?\" a la Kyle's mom on South Park. He said democracy exploited people. And I laughed and asked what system does not? Democracy is the longest running and most successful political experiment in all of the world's history. He argued that monarchies were longer, so I had to point out that every time a new king or queen takes the throne, it's a whole different government. We've had the same government for centuries now. How awesome is that? It may not be perfect, but it's the best there is. I asked him for alternatives. He said ... socialism. Which of course can't work in a country as large in land and population as the US. There are places like Norway that have socialistic tendencies and they work for the small freezing country of the hot, tall, and all super white. He said you just have to have enough people to want it, that\u2019s all. That\u2019s all? That\u2019s the hardest thing of all and that\u2019s why it won\u2019t work. Cuba has been trying for a long time to be a communist state. They have a small population and small amount of land to control, and THEY can\u2019t even get their shit together. There are less minds to change there than anywhere else. This is why communism is absolute horseshit. Here\u2019s an example: You\u2019re at a store. The clerk says, \u201cI\u2019ll give whoever gets to the counter first all their stuff for free, or you can both get here at the same time and I\u2019ll give you 50% off.\u201d Now, some people would want to work together, but most people would be like \u201cscrew him\u201d and try and get free stuff. We are ready to screw the other person for personal gain. There can be none of those people at all for communism or true socialism to work. Personally, I\u2019m glad to be one of those greedy bastards. That\u2019s what makes our economy run: the search for more for me. I said that for any step towards a social society, you have to change the hearts of men and women, not the government. Government and indeed all sovereignty is granted by the people. So unless all the people want it, it doesn\u2019t happen. You can\u2019t change people\u2019s heart with force. That will make them resent you and hate your happy, feel good government. He said it takes time. I told him that\u2019s impossible. For as many as you change to your mindset, there will be changing back, or switching to the other side for the first time. The only way to change it is all together with a Marxist revolution (to see a great example of what that is, watch the movie ANTZ). You get rid of the people that don\u2019t agree. The workers rise and revolt. And the world becomes a time share, kibbutz style. Communism is great on paper. Socialism seems even workable on paper. But there is one problem: people tend to be jerks. You go back to Marx and Rousseau and they think people are naturally good. But there is a whole other camp of people that think people are naturally bad. I\u2019m in the latter simply because if we were meant to be good, it\u2019d be a lot easier to be good than bad. So while communism is a fun thing to talk about in college, and even a nice daydream. It\u2019s never going to happen cause someone will always take advantage of the situation. Read Animal Farm by Orwell. All there needs to be in one person to screw it up. With democracy, if one person is screwing up, the people kick his or her ass to the curb. That\u2019s why we need to vote. You do have the power, like He Man. People discount that power, but it\u2019s tough, and right now, mostly old people use it. So get out of your peace and love hippy haze, your happy land of suger plum trees and lollipop lakes and wake up and smell the crusty burnt 7-11 coffee at the bottom of the pot. Democracy is ever changing and slightly flawed but anything else just doesn\u2019t make sense. So yes, communism is horse shit.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Now I know some people see me as the epitome of whiteness. I'm clearly on the bottom rung of middle class. I'm tall, well liked, can go to the bank and find I have good credit, went to college, did fairly well. But yet there's something else. I mean I severely attracted to women of color. My last two girlfriends were black and puerto rican. In my mind, this begs the question: Am I really as white as people think I am? I mean I can dance. I can understand and use correctly almost all hip-hop slang. I have a very Jewish sense of humor. I love soul food and tex mex. And I adore both Chinese food and little children (Let's face it, they are the cutest.) Maybe this has happened because of my life experience. I mean I did work with a hugely diverse population when I was in Austria. And now I work almost exclusively with African American children and am often the only non-black person in the room. But I liked southern food well before that. Although, thank God for my discovering greens. If you have never had them.....mmmmmm. It's a vegetable that tastes like meat. Can it get better? No, I think not. Plus, you can't work in Shadyside with kids and parents and not have a little Jewishness rub off. After my second summer there, \"Oy vey\" became part of my regular conversation. Of course, it might also be because I'm so German. We got fatty foods and mass genocide to look back on, and no one's smiling at that. I do enjoy a good polka or Weiner Shnitzel every now and again, and I was glad for the Austria experience to catch a little of my ancestry. I think what's really going on is I'm part of a new melting pot in America that is strictly culteral. Our hearts are melting and we're sharing customs, foods, games, whole cultures. Plus, we have a new world culture that is based on the internet, video games, anime, and cell phones. It's a weird esperonto-like phenomenon that's working. the shorthand of instant messaging is becoming a new form of spelling. Kindegarteners are more computer literate than me. We still label people by their skin color, but we're so different inside. It's like people that say their outside is male, but the inside is female. Maybe my outside is white and my inside is latino.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I am writing to inform everyone that my life has officially bottomed out. Now, I'm not writing this for pity. I'm not writing this out of some sick,therapeutic need to purge every little detail from my soul - which, from my limited experience, seems to be all the rage amongst bloggers. No, I write this because it's really quite amusing. Amusing in a bitter-my-life-is-going-no-where sort of way, but amusing none the less. You see, I was turned down for a job at Burger King. I don't mean to toot my own horn or anything, but I am pretty sure that I'm qualified. Heck, some may even call me over-qualified. After all, I am college educated. I graduated from a decent school - Grove City College - with decent grades - (ahem)magna cum laude (ahem). I'm sure no one else working at Burger King is capable of the following conversation: \"Sir, your fries will be up in a second. In the meantime, why don't we discuss Bahktin's concept of dialogic?\" True, that knowledge doesn't really come in handy at Burger King. As a matter of fact, as I've discovered, it really doesn't come in handy anywhere. The really weird thing is I kinda wanted the job at Burger King. I am practically broke. The money, while far from ample, would be appreciated. The hours would've been alright. Plus, it's not like it's my long term career goal. My long term career goal is to drive the Oscar Mayer wiener mobile. Ahh, dreams. And I have other problems too. My car - the '93 Lumina I affectionately call 'The Silver Bullet' - is in dire need of brake work. They squeak and squeal and grind. I only turn up the radio. What I can't hear, doesn't exist. My parents - instead of hounding me to move out - have become far too acceptive of my presence. They now make long term plans assuming I will be living at home. I'm not talking about a couple of months in advance. I'm talking about retirement plans. This is somehow much more depressing than having them hound me. I think even my parents have lost hope in me. I do have some plans, secret untested ways to make some cash. I think I might befriend an eccentric billionaire, get in on his will and then the next thing you know the cops are over and I'm saying: \"I dunno officer. He musta just fell down the stairs.\" If I can't shut my conscience up long enough to do that I've got back ups. For instance, I am currently selling advertising space on this blog. For a small, negotiable fee I will head each post with my current sponsor - I can just see it: 'Today's blog entry is brought to you by preparation H, preparation H, for all your hemorrhoid needs'. I could also slyly insert advertising subconsciously into the blog entries. Hold on while I take a long, slow sip of an ice cold Coke-a-cola. Mmmm, nothing satisfies like Coke on a hot day. Now where was I? Oh yes, hair brained schemes for money. Now it's time for my favorite scheme. You know how people pay good money for those fancy psychiatrist and therapist with their fancy degrees in their field and all they do is listen to you and offer no advice? Well, I figure I could do that. I can listen to people complain about their lives and their parents. I can offer no solutions. And I could do it for a whole lot less money. So, I'm glad to announce that I'm now an official unlicensed therapist. For only $10 an hour I will listen to your problems. For $13 an hour, I'll pretend to care. So, even though my life has hit rock bottom, do not despair for me. I've got my ideas and my creativity. I am sure that I'm going to make it after all, and someday, someday I am going to drive than wiener.

Come November we Americans - or at least the 30% of us who vote - will go out to the polls and cast our lot with either George W. Bush or John Kerry. This is a momentous decision, but if you are like an ever growing number of people I run into, you don't really care. This is especially painfully true of our young people. Yes, I know - as I posted on our previous, long forgotten blog - voting isn't cool. It never has been nor never will be. So, I think what young people need is a candidate they can really get behind. With this said, I would like to take this moment to declare my candidacy for the Presidency of the United States of America. Yes, I know according to the so-called 'Constitution'I am too 'young' to run for president. To this charge I only have one reply: constitution shmonstitution. I have my right to seek gainful employment and I shouldn't be blocked. This rule is clearly biased against the young. This is the same reason high schoolers can play in the NBA. Now all I need to find is some judge to eviscerate the constitution. That shouldn't be hard. It's what they seem to do. Now that that's out of the way, I know what your next question is: \"But James why should we vote for you?\" A very good question, deserving of a very good answer. So why should you vote for me. Because I'm super cool, that's why. But don't take my word for. My mom thinks I'm super cool too. She also thinks I'm very handsome and quite a catch. So, there naysayers. You don't hear Bush or Kerry's mothers saying that. Still not convinced? Want to know where I stand on the issues, what my platform is? Fine. I now proudly unveil the platform which will carry me to victory come November. I, James Catullo, promise the following: 1) Mondays, according to my careful research of Garfield comics, are the worse day of the week. Therefore, once I am president, I shall declare that every Monday morning from 10:30 to 11 AM be dubbed 'Dance Party USA'. During this time, according to the law, all business shall cease and all Americans shall dance as they see fit. 2) The band Nickelback will stop recording and touring. 3) I will lower taxes. 4) All Americans will be able to declare 1 personal holiday a year. On their personal holidays people will be excused from work or school. This holiday can be any day and for any reason. If you wish to spend the day at home in observance of Scott Baio's birthday, so be it. 5) Women will want to go out with me. I'm adding it to the constitution. Either they go out with me or they go to prison. 6) I will build more prisons to house the expected millions of women who still won't go out without me. 7) I will cut the size of government. and finally... 8) I will change the national anthem to 'The Hustle.' This way whenever an American Olympic athlete wins a gold medal, he or she will do a reverent and tearful rendition of 'The Hustle' on the winners podium. And that's funny. So, come November remember you have another choice besides Bush or Kerry - and no, I don't mean Nader. When you vote, America, I want you to remember the only candidate who really knows what it means to be American. I want you to remember the only candidate who speaks to you in the language you understand, the language of old sitcoms. Most of all America, I want you to remember: DO THE HUSTLE!!

May I echo that it does indeed beat the pants off the old Carmike Theatre across the way. To start, it cost 7 dollars for a movie. Carmike, $7.50. Now not just the ticket prices, but everything has prices that small, significant ammount lower that you could say, YEA! it's better, And Cheaper. Now i saw Spiderman 2 last night, and I'll say i didn't like it as well as the first. Yes, the CGI is a bit cleaner, and the build up was good, but the story was not as... well... \"yea that kicks ass\"-esque. A fight scene with Doc. Octopus cuold have gone longer and been better (a significant source of untapped territory), and the plot somewhat turns you against spidey, but a scene with a runaway train was done very well. But that is not why i Blog for you today! The eason is simple...Donnie Iris. As i left work on wed. it was aobut 6:50 when i heard on the radio, DVE nonetheless, that Michelle Michaels was at the new Cinemark Theatre in Monaca, and she was antici...........pating the concert event of the week... Donnie Iris and B.E. Taylor would be performing an acoustic set at the opening of the new Theatre. Holy King of Cool Batman! I had to get down there! So going as fast as the legal limit would allow me, I raced over the the Lowes Shopping center to catch the cool King, B.E., and some kick ass guitarist named Rick belting out 8 Days A Week, Rocky Racoon, I wanna Hold Your Hand, Love is like a Rock, Vitimin L, Ah Leia, and The Star Spangled Banner for an encore. It was so great. Plus i won a free T-shirt for an upcoming movie called \"Harold and Kumar go to White Castle\" And an Allman Bros. CD.

He's getting away, quick turn on the spotlights and try and find him!\" I can only hope that someday, that is a possibility, just so there can be more spotlights in the sky. I really don't think there are enough... at least not around here. I'm sure in Hollywood they have millions of spotlights (of course they are harder to see due to the intense smog and their even more intense governor.) Around Beaver County, however, these things are pure luxury that comes around ever few years. Let's see... I remember spotlights for the new Wal-Mart that opened (so they can let everyone know where to protest, of course), there were spotlights when Lowe's opened (I think Lowe's actually sells spotlights, actually...) and the Mall had spotlights years ago when they remodeled it. And of course we have a spotlight just dedicated to the Beaver County superhero: The Cruiser (he tends to concentrate his powers while sitting in front of his '72 mustang at the county's weekly car cruises...) There were spotlights in the sky last night. In a weird twist, they were not only buzzing around to celebrate the opening of a Spider-Man 2, but also to celebrate the opening of a brand new Cinemark movie theater. Two great reasons to have spotlights in the sky. My area of Beaver County, which houses the tri-shopping mecca of Wal-Mart plaza, Lowe's Plaza, and the Beaver Valley Mall, is now experiencing its consumer renaissance. The trend nowadays has moved beyond strip malls, outlets, and indoor malls and has moved to the \"shopping village.\" It's a set of malls, warehouse stores, and strip outlets along with a movie theater and a ton of over-priced restaurants (the kind that have their walls covered with crazy crap). And that's when that area becomes known only for its stores. For example, Robinson Twp, Cranberry, Boardman. Three huge shopping meccas that I only know because I go there to shop and have a good time. I have heard rumors that people actually live in these places, going about their daily lives and ignoring the frightening things that are operating right down the street (kind of like the folks that live near the power plant). Is this the fate of my town and my county? And really... is that a bad thing? Last night marked the grand opening of a new Cinemark movie theater in the area. 12 theaters, stadium seating, surround sound, and reasonably priced tickets. This, of course, beats the pants off of our former theater, which could be described as \"malnourished,\" which had eight theaters, sticky and flat floors, ripped seats, and ticket prices that required you to take out a loan. Did I mention they only got the \"big\" movies? Hopefully our new neighbors at the Mark will be wise enough to get me some juicy independent movies... or at least the new Woody Allen movie coming out this fall. Now I haven't been to this theater yet, although that will change when I go there tonight, but I hear its pretty nice. It sits in the newest of the shopping centers in Beaver County. There is a brand-new Shop n Save and the aforementioned Lowe's right next door. And they are in the process of building a Starbucks (yes!), a Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Home Depot, and Best Buy all within the next couple years. We are truly on our way... and I couldn't be happier about it! Sure this may bring a tad more traffic, but these things are far enough away from my house that I won't be bothered. And at the same time, I won't have to drive 30 minutes to get to the stores I love. Most of the people in Beaver County leave the county to go shopping, and now all of that money will stay here! And so in conclusion, I welcome you new theater. I thank you for riding in on a horse that looks and sounds wonderful, for bringing Spider-Man 2 with you (a movie that I've not only been looking forward to, but will totally knock Michael Moore out of the box office), and for further murdering live theatre in Beaver County!\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "As I write this blog entry, I lay in my bed with my iBook. Not only am I writing this blog, but I'm publishing it from my bed too, and I'm also streaming my iTunes playlist, talking on AIM and sending some e-mail all while laying tummy down on the quilt my grandma made me. Now before you call witchcraft and string me up by neck... halt! I'm not using some weird smoke and mirrors method of accessing the internet. I'm using technology from the 21st century!!! It's called WI-FI (aka wireless internet). And holy smokes it's great. Wireless internet is an idea that first formulated back during the Cold War. It was a young Al Gore who first was struck in the head by an apple (much like Sir Newton, except this apple was thrown at Gore by Ollie North). Mr. Gore said to himself, in a very slow and monotonous tone, \"I should create a world wide communication network... with my bare hands! All by myself!\" And then, about an hour later, over a bowl of scrambled eggs with ketchup, he thought out loud, \"You know what... once I have this internet thing completed, I should make it go through the air without wires... I will make this with my bare hands! The question is how...\" And so Al Gore set to work on the world wide web. Using his vast knowledge of boring things, he was able to device networks and servers, cables and browsers, even spam and viruses. The man thought of everything (honest). Gore spent as much time as a human man could, and then some, on perfecting this tool that would revolutionize the world. And once he had things \"good enough\" he decided to move on to making the wires disappear and the world wide web go air born. For this task, he contracted the help of three key men: David Copperfield, the Verizon Guy, and Jerry Stiller. David Copperfield was brought in for his masterful skills as illusion. He could make any wire disappear with enough bed sheets and spotlights. This would be the go-to-guy for making the wires less. That's when the Verizon Guy comes in. You may know him as the Rivers Cuomo-looking dude who says \"Can you hear me now?\" He is there to hook up the service so it goes at a decent by not great speed. Once it's actually up and running, Jerry Stiller comes in to test it out. Of course he can't go a few minutes without yelling and shaking his hands while looking at a laptop without any wires. \"What is going on!!!?\" he will yell, and George Costanza, Kevin James, and Ben Stiller all peek their heads in to see what's wrong. Chalk up another great invention by Al Gore. No wait, don't... he might sell it to the Chinese. And it was just yesterday that we got wi-fi installed at our house. It was a big step for us, one that I take full credit for initiating. You see, I recently got a new iBook, and I insisted on getting a Apple Airport Extreme card in it (which is the Apple-brand wireless card). It was once I got home and began talking about wireless internet, that my brother got very interested in it. He went ahead and found a Netgear 802.11g (that's how much it weighs) wi-fi router and about a week later it was at my doorstep. The thing itself is amazing... I was originally worried about how far it would reach in our house, and in the end, it goes all the way out in to the middle of the street! I immediately had to set up the security on it, so as to prevent some drive-by wi-fi. Just think, next time I blog... I could be on my roof, in my basement, or on the toilet.

I do all the things that my grandmother can't do anymore, like carry things up and down stairs and lift anything weighing more than couple pounds. (Now, here, just as a side note not having anything to do with the rest of this post, I feel the pressing desire to tell you about the incredible find I made in my grandmother's basement. I found an actual, genuine campaign pin for Richard Millhouse Nixon circa 1960. You can tell it's from 1960 by looking at Nixon's picture and measuring his jowls. In this picture, Nixon's jowls are still above his chin. Hence, this is a relatively young Nixon from 1960. By the time Nixon was actually president his jowls reached past his chin. By the time he left office they were to his collar. I understand at the time of his death, Richard Nixon's jowls were flapping around somewhere near his nipples. Well, anyway, this pin is really cool and I plan to start wearing it...A lot) After a couple of hours of carrying laundry and moving boxes around her basement, my grandmother pointed out that it was past noon, lunch time. She informed me that she had almost no food in her house. Luckily, grandma had two Subway Club cards chock full of stamps and I was dispatched to bring back lunch. Now, a full card entitles you to one free six inch sub with the purchase of a medium drink. Two full cards entitles you to a free foot long with the purchase of a medium drink. I'm sorry to bore everyone with what seems to be trifling details and fine print, but I assure everyone that this information is of vital importance to this inane little essay I am writing. Now, it was my goal to buy two separate six inch subs while spending as little money as possible. I, therefore, would try to get both free while buying only one drink. This would not be easy since it is against the rules of the Subway club card, but I figured I could do it. I walked into Subway, and up to the poor unsuspecting high schooler working behind the counter. \"Hello,\" I said. \"Can I get two different six inch subs with these cards and only buy one drink?\" \"No,\" The girl said. This did not deter me since this was the answer I expected. I knew that I would need to take a more clever tack.\" \"What if,\" I said, \"I got a foot long consisting of two halves that were completely different?\" \"That would be two six inches,\" she said. Hmmm, I could see that she would be a tough egg to crack. She seemed somewhat tired and annoyed, although I had not yet begun to become tiresome and annoying. \"Yes,\" I said, \"And two six inches add up to one foot long.\" \"But they'd be different.\" \"So?\" \"That makes them two different sandwiches.\" \"Why couldn't it be one sandwich that changes half way through?\" \"It just can't.\" \"Let me ask you a question.\" I was doing things like tenting my fingers and furrowing my brow to show that I was about to make an excellent point. \"Are you the same now as you were when you were five? Of course you're not, but you're still the same person. So, why can't a sub be different at the ten inch mark than at the two inch mark, and still be the same sub?\" After finishing my point, I threw my hands in the air just a little to either said of my head in a sort of ta-da gesture. The girl just stared at me blankly for a second before saying, \"Sir, don't make me get my manager.\" So, I relented. Since I still didn't want to buy two drinks I got a foot long sub of what my grandmother wanted. I would eat half even though it was not what I really wanted (I know, I'm such a martyr). But then something happened when the girl was putting on the veggies which set me off again. My Grandmother wanted cucumbers on her sandwich - because she's old and old people like things like cucumber - on the other hand, I - being young a virile - detest cucumber. So, I asked, ever so nicely, if there was a way that one half of the sandwich would not be bothered by said cucumber. The girl said that the veggies could be completely different on each side. When she said this it set off something in my brain. \"Wait a second,\" I said. \"Doesn't having completely different veggies on each side side make this into two separate sandwiches?\" \"It's still all ham.\" \"No.\" I was enjoying this. \"That half is ham with cucumbers. This half is ham without cucumbers. That's two completely different sandwiches.\" I got no response to this but a blank stare. I decided to go one anyway. \"You see,\" I said, going in to lecture mode, \"As soon as you change one thing you change the essential sandwichness of the sandwich. Therefore by changing something on only half of the sandwich, we are now looking at two separate sandwiches. You only insist that it is the same because you are stuck in the narrow societal perpetrated idea that the sandwich is defined by the meat, and everything else is unessential. However, one might argue, that you could just as easily consider the veggies to be the essential part of the sandwich. Then you would have one cucumber sandwich and one lettuce sandwich, completely different sandwiches. In reality, I would argue, all parts of the sandwich are essential. To change one part of the sandwich - no matter how seemingly insignificant - you change the entire sandwich.\" At this point I wasn't even arguing for anything in particular. I was arguing simply for the sake of arguing. I didn't want another sandwich at this point. What I really wanted was for someone to pop up and say \"Boy, you sure are clever\". Of course, this didn't happen. The only response I got was from the poor girl on the other side of the counter. \"Sir,\" she said, \"Would you please check out now? Please.\" Shalom\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Dream Phone is a lusty game of infinite intrigue. Crafted in the mountains of Tibet by monks that understood the secret behind girls ages 4-12, Dream Phone is a glimmer of hope that rests inside all girls. The object of the game is simple, call one out of the 25 boys featured in the game and listen to the clue he gives you. It is through these clues that you must eventually figure out who has a crush on you. However, this is no easy task! First of all, these dudes all have a weird aura about them. Any one of them could be a character in Saved by the Bell, but almost all of them look like rapists and child molesters. Everyone you call seems to know the guy who has a crush on you, and they know the guy inside and out. Every facet of this mystery man\u2019s personality is shared by them, and there is never any contradiction. \u201cHe will eat almost anything\u2026 except ice cream,\u201d \u201cHe loves to play sports\u2026 except volleyball.\u201d \u201cHe looks good in everything he wears\u2026 but he doesn\u2019t wear anything yellow.\u201d Why are these guys telling me this?! And without any prompting or nagging on my behalf. No matter who you are, when you call them they are there ready to hand out clues about their best friend. I don\u2019t even think my buddies could agree on things about me, if I ever did have a crush on someone and that someone began making random phone calls. (I know that\u2019s a stretch, but this is the setup of the entire game!) They would call all of my 25 buddies (buddies who always hang out in the same places every day) and ask them questions about their secret admirer. My friends wouldn't know what the hell to say. \"Uh, he likes all kinds of sports... except sports. Man he hates sports\" or \"He often tells off color jokes,\" or \"Wait... doesn't Mike like hockey? Crap, I'm not supposed to say his name. Oh who cares, you don't want to go out with this guy anyways.\" What I don't understand is how the game actually works. I mean, I've played it before... so I kind of grasp it's vague Clue-like rules. But the giant pink phone is what boggles my mind. You dial these numbers in there, and then this Stephen Hawkin-esque voice replies with the clues. How does it know what clues to tell me?! What if one of the boys decides to be a total tool and tell me a clue to throw me off, one that doesn't even apply to my secret admirer. I suspected that the phone was in actuality a real phone, which called to these real boys who are still sitting around on the Milton Bradley payroll just answering the phones. They were very busy back in 1991, but now it's just when punks like me decide to have a little fun. The game is rife with stereotypes... even if they are of the Saved by the Bell sort. The majority of the dudes are white, there are only three blacks, two Asians and a Mexican. Sounds like a setup for a joke. And of course amongst the white guys, there are nerds (with names like \"Spencer\" and \"Bruce\"), there are \"metrosexual\" guys (of course that wasn't a term back in the day), and there are total hunks with flowing hair and cheesy smiles. While I played this game with others, there is the option to play by yourself. That's right, you could sit in your room all by yourself and call these robotic man-hunks of the 90's. Is there anything more pathetic than that? Why not just pull out a phone book and start calling random people, asking them for clues about your secret admirer.

Nothing can divert this rank villainy. What, you might ask, could be so foul? Is it AIDS? Is it poverty? Is it rhetorical questions? No. No. No. I am talking about a plague at once more benign and more devilish than any of these. I am talking about a scourge which wants nothing more than to ruin your good times. I am talking about those idiots who bring guitars to parties and want to 'jam'. If you attend a good number of gatherings, get togethers, parties, and the like, there is a good chance you know exactly what I am talking about. You go to a party, and everything's A-Ok. There's food, people, your choice of fine beverages. People are talking, joking, laughing, having an all around good time. Then, Like a foreboding crack of thunder in the distance, someone brings in his guitar. This is quickly followed by the realization that many people have guitars. Often they drop everything they are doing and run to their car to get them. Eventually, someone suggest that all the guitar players get together somewhere - often in right in the middle of the party - and jam. For those of you who don't know what I mean by 'jamming', allow me to enlighten you. To jam in the musical sense - as opposed to the raspberry preserve sense - has, in my experience, two definitions. Definition one: What happens when a group of talented musicians get together and play music in a fun and unencumbered way. Definition two: What happens when drunk douche bags get together with guitars - not necessarily in tune - at a party and proceed to annoy anyone who isn't playing. As you can see, jamming in the former definition is fine and I have no problem with it. Jamming in the latter sense however is not fine and I despise it. It has yet - even once - to add anything positive to any party I've ever been to. Quite the contrary, it often ruins parties. It makes conversation more difficult. It's never as entertaining to the people not jamming as it is to the people jamming. As a matter of fact, jamming has the knack of bringing parties to a grinding halt. People are held captive by these idiots - who always play way too loud. The enjoyment of the masses is negated for the enjoyment of a small group of morons. Now here's the real problem. In every group of jammers - I think I just coined a phrase - there is one guy who is really, genuinely good, and it would probably be okay if just this one alpha guitarist would play by himself. It would be kind of the low rent equivalent of the smooth jazz pianist at high society functions. However, people with guitars always materialize around this alpha guitarist and start jamming with him. This is patently absurd. At the aforementioned high society functions you never hear this said to the smooth jazz pianist: \"Dude, I've got a key board in my car. I'm totally going to get it and we are totally going to jam.\" It just doesn't happen in civilized society. Of course, the people who join the alpha guitarist are of variable skills. There are usually one or two guys who more or less know what they're doing: play things in the right key, keep rhythm, know a bunch of cords. Even this is kind of OK. At least it doesn't sound horrible. But this is never how it goes because, invariably, the group is joined by some guy - sometimes guys - who just sucks. This guy always plays too loud, plays in the wrong key, and for some reason can't keep his guitar in tune. Now the alpha and beta guitarist - instead of doing the reasonable thing and telling the omega guitarist to get lost - have to play louder to cover up this travesty. To make matters worse. It always happens that no one knows the same songs. So you get one person trying to show another person how to play something, which they proceed to play poorly. For some reason, they manage to never play a song through the whole way. Often they'll spend twenty minutes noodling around on two or three cords which grows monotonous and dull. And through all of this, the other people at the party are just trying to have a good time. They want to talk to friends, meet new people, laugh, and whatnot, but those stupid jammers just refuse to go away. You can't talk over them. You can't talk to them - and I've had conversations end because all of a sudden my friend just had to jam. You can't even dance to them, because they usually really suck. They are like a black hole in the middle of the party, sucking the fun away from everyone else so that they are the only ones really enjoying themselves. At least they don't eat all the food. So, in conclusion, let me leave everyone with a good piece of advice. If you are going to a party and want to take a guitar with you, stop for a second. Now, ask yourself a few questions. Are you playing in a band that has been asked to perform at this party? Are you being paid to perform at this party? Are you going to a party where everyone - or at least a vast majority of the people - will jam with you or not mind if you jam? Are you Jimmi Hendrix? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then go, take your guitar. But if you answered no to all these questions, then LEAVE YOUR STUPID GUITAR AT HOME!!! Try having a conversation for a change. You might like it. Shalom P.S. I would like everyone's help with a very important decision. I have finally followed through on my promise - made here in this blog a few weeks ago - to grow a mustache. I have not shaved my upper lip for almost a week. As you might imagine, my mustache is in that strange, sleazy, half-there state at the moment. Now this doesn't bother me, but...I have a job interview tomorrow. Should I shave my dirt-stache for my job interview or just keep it? Seriously, I'd like to know what everyone thinks. Even if you don't know me, even if you find yourself on this blog on mistake or on a whim, let me know what you think. Just leave a comment and hopefully they will help me decide whether or not to shave. Thanks. shalom (again)\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I got a new job! I'm going to sell insurance. That may not sound like much, indeed it's not the thrill a minute lifestyle I'm used to working with bad kids and all, but it's a good job that will pay well if I apply myself. The funny thing is that I will go broke before my job starts. I have to shell out about $300 to get licensed to sell insurance. And the job that I am doing is not paying me until the end of September I recently found out. So that sucks. Yet another reason why insurance will be good for me.

Today, something exciting happened. No, I did not discover that 'Boy Meets World' is on twice a day on ABC Family. I've known that for quite some time. I am talking about real excitement. I am talking about genuine heart pounding, pulse racing, bowel loosening, staring death in the face excitement. Of course, it's wrapped in the dull and mundane, but such is my life. Today, I was simply taking a short trip to good old Grove City - which for the uniformed contains no groves and is most certainly a city in name only. I was simply going about my normal activities. Going to the local library, scouring for work and the like. As I piloted my '93 Chevy Lumina - the very sexy, scantily rusted car I have dubbed 'The Silver Bullet' - toward a red light everything was going to plan. My mind was hardly on my driving. I was contemplating such lofty ideas as the responsibilities of free will and the uselessness of Aquaman, as I began to depress my brake pedal. Suddenly, to my abject horror, I found my foot and the pedal drop effortlessly to the floor of my car. There was no resistance, and - even more alarming - there was no deceleration. My brakes had given out. Now, I would like to say that I remained absolutely cool, calm, collected, poised, but I would also like to say that I run a small island nation in the South Pacific. Needless to say I panicked. There was a truck ahead of me stopped at the light. I was going to crash into it. I just knew it. My heart leaped up into my throat as my stomach dropped down into my bowels. Luckily, my liver stayed put. Sweat popped out along my forehead, and soaked my underarms. I actually made this sound: \"DAAARRAARAAARGH!!!\" Of course, this was screamed out like a little girl, with tears streaming down my face. I had never been more sure that disaster and, yes, maybe even death was inevitable. You may assume that my life flashed before my eyes, that I was treated to a kind of going away montage of my greatest hits. That is what people say happens, but it didn't happen to me. I didn't see my parents faces, or the lost loves of my life, or my missed opportunities. All I saw was the rear end of a Mack truck, getting progressively and unavoidably closer. Then again, maybe my life did flash before my eyes and I just didn't notice it. After all, most people don't notice my life. Why should I? Still, I was not consigned to disaster. I was not going down without a fight. This was not to be the end of James. Oh, no. So, I did the only things I could do: I prayed and I desperately tried the brakes again and again. I pumped those brakes for everything they were worth. Trust me, you could watch all the porn in the world and not see pumping as vigorous or hard as this. I hit those brakes with everything I had and prayed that somewhere, some how, my car had some residual memory of stopping, that there was just one more stop left in the old girl. I kept pressing harder and harder, until I thought that my foot would burst through the floor and drag along the pavement. Even then I would have remained pressing for dear life. Finally, a miracle happened. As I pressed harder, the car actually began to slow down, and not just from coasting. Somewhere, brakes were causing friction. I was slowing down. Joy of joys, thank you Jesus, I was slowing down. I was actually coming to a stop. I was going to survive. I was going to live. Of course, the braking power was pretty bad. I would still probably hit the truck. But no, with my new confidence. I had the wherewithal to turn myself onto the shoulder of the road completely avoiding disaster. Then, the light changed. The truck moved and I ever so carefully - never driving above 3 m.p.h - I was able to guide my wearied vessel into a parking lot to safety. The emergency had passed. I was safe. I was alive. Nothing bad had happened at all. I felt like dancing. I felt like singing. I felt like bursting out of my car and hugging and kissing every person - or any hot girls at least - in sight. Now safe, I felt life rush back into me. I had come so close to death, to tragedy, and I had avoided it by the narrowest of margins. I did the only thing I could do. I curled up into the fetal position and began sucking my thumb. After all, this really was quite a bit for my milquetoast soul to handle. Now, I could go on. I could tell you about the time spent in the parking lot stretched out on the hood waiting for AAA. I could tell you about Dave - the less than talkative flatbed driver. I could tell you how this caused yet another unforeseen charge to my already overused credit card. I could tell about all of this, but that is only the mundane shell, the ordinary part of this extraordinary adventure. I have ordinary adventures every day, and so do you. So, I'm simply going to leave it to the extraordinary today. Who knows when I'll have this opportunity again? Plus, 'Boy Meets World' is on.

I usually play until I win. This being the case, I often end up playing for hours! Hours! I could be writing the great American novel, but instead I am moving cards from one pile to another. Not even real cards but pictures of cards. It's not like I have nothing better to do. (Well, that's not always the case.) I have had problems in the past with gaming. It tends to take up a lot of my time. But it's a cheap addiction. I usually play some video game every day. I'd say on average I do 45 minutes a day on one of my game systems or my computer. While on my computer, I can do other things like surf the net, chat with friends, or actual work. But I realize that this vice is a cheap one. I figure I spend about $20 a month on this habit. When I went to Dave and Buster's a lot, it was probably twice that, but seeing as I'm close to broke that has stopped. It's way cheaper than cigarettes which is like $4 a pack now. It's even cheaper than buying a bottle of wine a week. Something else I wish I could do. And it's absolutely cheaper than whoring. They cost way too much for me. And they risk of disease and the pending medical bills from that is far more than I'm willing to spend. So video games is a good vice for me. It's controllable. The real problem is time. I have been a little late for work more than once cause I had to finish a game or get to a save spot. And the days in middle school when I was constantly hollered at for being late for the dinner table for similar reasons. But those were the days when you had to pause the game and go eat and come back. And God forbid something bump that nintendo. I wanted to kill the dog more than once for that. The other night I was tired and had to get something off my computer around about 11 PM. I began talking to Mike a little, and then I opened the solitaire game. Bad move. I like the Spider Solitaire which most people shy away from cause it's complex and stategy out the wazoo not unlike high level chess. And I don't mess around with the one or two suit games. It's four suit or nothing. The game is hard, but I can usually beat it in a few tries. Well, it got to be 11:30, I had to work at 8 AM the next morning and I had a long day. My eyelids were dropping. I was fallign asleep and my hand was still moving the mouse to move the cards. What the hell is wrong with me? I was falling asleep and I could not stop playing a dumb inconsequential card game! I was fighting sleep to try and win a card game. I just wanted to win. I just wanted it more than sleep. I'll have to reset my values: 1. Food 2. Sleep 3. Women 4. Video games Okay that's better. I'm going to get off the computer and shut off the solitaire. I mean I borrowed two games and I need to play them.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Now, I'm sure that no one - not even members of my own family - cares about this, but I just want everyone to know that I have a particular soft spot in my heart and upon my palette for fortune cookies. Even though I can hear everyone yawning at their computer monitors, I am going to proceed to praise the fortune cookie. I know it's an odd, not too mention a rather random thing to write about - especially considering that I haven't had Chinese in quite some time. I just like fortune cookies. I like the idea of a food that really says something. I like breaking things open only to find a special surprise. That's wonderful reinforcement for many of my more destructive desires. As a matter of fact I wish more things were like fortune cookies, and could be destroyed only to gather some greater wisdom. Wouldn't it be wonderful if Ming vases or Faberge eggs also contained notes or prizes inside. Wouldn't you just love to smash a priceless work of art to the ground only to find a little slip of paper with a message which automatically becomes hilarious once the words 'in bed' are amended to it? More than just the hidden prize qualities of fortune cookies, I actually really like their taste. I don't think enough people really think about eating fortune cookies. Everyone gets caught up in the breaking and reading, the actually eating of the fortune cookie often becomes a secondary concern. Eating the cookie is seen more as a neat way to dispose of refuse than something to be truly enjoyed. But next time you break apart one of these culinary mystery boxes, I want you too actually pay attention to eating it. I want you to enjoy the crunch, savor the delicate flavor. For me, this flavor will be forever linked to the late evening Chinese food that would be delivered in the college dorm. It's just wonderful. Despite all of this, there is, alas, one thing which can ruin the whole fortune cookie experience: not getting a fortune. You may know what I am talking about. Sometimes you don't get a true fortune. Sometimes instead of getting a real fortune, a glimpse into your future - something like, 'You will undertake a great journey' - you get a piece of advice, a goofy aphorism - such as, 'A man of wisdom is of great value'. Personally, I don't want to be lectured by my fortune cookies. I don't want to learn great life lessons. I want to know what's going to happen. I want a real fortune. Sadly, I fear these aphorisms are becoming more and more prevalent in fortune cookies. They are watering down the whole fortune cookie experience. They take away all the mystery of fortune cookies. They turn magic into morality lessons. Plus, they really suck for adding 'in bed'. In short, the aphorism fortune cookie message must be stopped. It's time for some one with a bold vision to step up to the fortune cookie plate and put an end to this madness. That's right, you guessed it, I want to write fortune cookie messages. While this may seem like a fairly easy task. 'Any one,' you may say to yourself 'can write vague generalizations about the future.' That is why I do not plan to be vague. I am going to be deadly specific. I feel this is a fantastic way to combat the growing wishy-washiness of the current fortune cookie environment. I also think they're much funnier this way. So now, without further ado, I present you with some of my test fortune cookie fortunes. 'You are not going to score with your current date' 'Before midnight of this coming Tuesday you will find a priceless jewel in the restroom of a Greyhound station' 'You will be shot in the back of the head at a 7-11 while buying milk which is one day away from expiring' 'You will cut your toe-nails on Thursday, 10-ish, when you want to wear sandals but realize that you have disgusting toe-nails' 'Look to your left, look to your right. The person who's going to give you herpes is certainly in sight' 'You will call off work because you get really caught up in a lame VH1 countdown show. You will vehemently deny this, but your cover will be blown when accidentally mention that you think \"The Final Countdown\" by Europe is actually a rocking song despite it's place on the worst songs of all time list' 'The Canadian government will bug your phones and follow your every step simply because they can and they know no one is going to believe you' 'Suddenly, at the age of 78, you will realize that your whole life has been nothing but a sham. You have denied your dreams for too long, but now you are going to finally follow your dreams of becoming a world-renown tap dancer. You will follow your dreams by enrolling in a Performing Arts high school much like the one in the film Fame. While there you will fall in love with an instructor. However, knowing that your love is illicit and can never come to fruition, you sublimate all your feelings into your dancing. You dance like you've never danced before, because you haven't. Finally, on the day of the big all school talent show, you confess your feelings to the instructor. The instructor admits that he/she shares your feelings. With your heart full of requited love, you go on to give the most astounding performance the school has ever seen. After all the school has never seen a 78 year old freshman. After the talent show, a Broadway scout approaches you and offers you a part in the chorus in an upcoming big, Broadway musical. You accept. On the eve of the musicals big opening, the star breaks his/her leg. The crusty, but lovable, director chooses you from among the chorus to fill in. You succeed brilliantly. All the reviews gush about you. That evening you will die quietly in your sleep in bed.' Now, that's what I call a fortune.

You see, just the other day I noticed something distinctly odd amongst the penis enlargement and home loan advertisements in my E-mail folder. There was a message entitled, \"petition signature confirmed - I'm With Busey\". This sent up a red flag in my head. Are they talking, I thought to myself, about that stupid reality show with Gary Busey and that guy who claimed to be a comedy writer even though he showed no sign of a working sense of humor? And, by the way, I have no idea why I use the 'they' pronoun, I guess I like to think of a vast underground network of people filling my inbox, instead of single, solitary nerds. Anyway, with my curiosity sufficiently piqued I opened the e-mail, and to my abject horror discovered that someone, this so-called 'Allen Jacobs', has signed, using my e-mail address, a petition to bring back the show 'I'm With Busey'. I was truly horrified. Trust me if 'I'm With Busey' makes it back on the air, I had nothing to do with it. I'm absolving myself of all guilt right now. It was all a horrible, horrible mistake. Whoever this Allen Jacobs is must have mistyped his e-mail address and come up with mine. Please, you have to believe me. I don't want 'I'm With Busey' back on the air. I would never knowing aid in unleashing such a devastating evil onto the world. I mean, this blog is bad enough, but, then again, I'm pretty much convinced no one reads this, so there's no harm here. Eventually, after much renting of clothes and gnashing of teeth, I calmed down and became quite curious. What is this petition? Where'd it come from? Are people actually signing this thing? Shouldn't Gary Busey be dead by now anyway? So, I read the entire e-mail message and found that the petition - and the e-mail - originated from PetitionOnline.com. So went to the sight and found the Busey petition. Apparently 'I'm With Busey' has - had? - fans, and they cannot imagine why this \"innovative and creative\" show would be canceled by Comedy Central \"without any given reason.\" Apparently, these people are unfamiliar with a little thing I like to call the Nielson television ratings. Sufficiently satisfied the 'I'm with Busey' petition was mostly harmless, I decided to explore the site a little fuller. Let me tell you, a whole world opened up before my eyes. A world populated by obsessive dorks and losers with too much time on their hands and internet access. I felt right at home. People have petitions for everything. Some of them even made bringing back 'I'm with Busey' seem like a good idea. Why would anyone in his right mind sign a petition to keep 'On Air with Ryan Seacrest' true to its name? And that's not a rhetorical question. I really want to know. If you can fill me in, please do. There are a lot of odd petitions. Most of them having to do with bringing back canceled shows on sci-fi and stuff having to do with video games - which gives you a pretty good idea who the average users are. Mixed in amongst these typical internet type concerns where things such as a petition to prove that someone's ex boyfriend is a real 'Dick Eating Dick Face' and someone who desperately wants to see Bob's Big Boy make a comeback in the worse possible way - although, I'm pretty sure, Big Boy can't come back any other way. There was one really quaint petition entitled 'Stop the Hate' which was obviously posted by some well meaning, but utterly clueless liberal teenager. This ranks right up there with putting those stickers that say 'hating' at the bottom of stop signs. Sure, it's a swell message and all, but it doesn't really do anything but help the person who put it up feel good about himself. It's not as though a Klansman is going drive by one of those stop signs or see a petition against hate and all of a sudden clap his palm to his forehead exclaiming, \"Stop hating, why didn't I think of that\" - but then again I didn't actually look at the petition, just the name, it could be quite different from what I expect. Now, here's the part which really got me thinking. PetitionOnline.com bills itself as 'a premiere free speech forum.' While I agree that free speech is one of the most important rights reserved for us in the constitution, and that this site is certainly a forum for free speech, I would be a little wary about calling it premiere. Now, maybe the PetitionOnline creators started with noble causes, to, say, petition the government - which is expressly protected by the 1st amendment - but when the founding fathers added the first amendment I'm sure creating a petition to get a lame TV show back on the air wasn't high on their minds. I'm not saying that they'd be against it, but if they knew that people where using free speech to save 'I'm with Busey', they would most likely answer with a yawn - of course you'd first have to explain television to them and then give them some sort of idea what Gary Busey's like and then describe the show to them. \"By Gum,\" they may say, \"Sure we fought for freedom of speech, and your silly little petitions are cute and all, but doesn't anyone have anything real to say? Aggrievments to the government perhaps?\" People fought and died for serious issues, not so some moron could sign a petition as 'BUTTSEX' - the same person listed his location as 'BUTTSEX' and left, as a comment, 'No, seriously, I like BUTTSEX'. It just seems that people use the term freedom of speech too loosely anymore. I don't think anyone should even mention it until they are seriously being quieted by the government. I'm tired of hearing people whine about freedom of speech because no one wants to listen to them. You're guaranteed the freedom to express, but not the right to a major forum or a willing audience. Although if there's one thing I've learned from OnlinePetition.com, no matter how lame an opinion you have, some idiots are going to be with you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm bringing back 'Who's the Boss'.

Yeah, me either... I'll break it down like this... black beans 360 calories 26 g fiber... I don't know about this one. dottisweightlosszone, can you be trusted??? 2.5 g fat 0 calcium gauc 110 calories 9 g fat 4 g fiber 0 calcium I have no idea about the tortillas... lets just hope I compensated somewhere. so i'm like at 1000 calories for the day, and my head hurts from doing all this math. I think I'm having a pretty lo-cal dinner, but lower than 400 calories, I'd be surprised. Dammit!!!!! J/k :) it's all good. No stress...

He's a cool person, with a thing for documentaries uncovering social disputes among the American foundation. Did I mention he's cool? Anyway, in my science class, we watched \"The Private Life of Plants\" by David Attenbourgh. In it, a few of the plants it showed used their flowers to transport pollen by making the flower look like a female bee. Male bees would try to mate with the flower, and somewhere along the way the pollen got on the bee. The video also said that if a male bee is already trying to mate with the \"female\", another male bee will sometimes try to mate with the first male bee that's trying to mate with the flower. What would best describe that? Weird? Sick? Perverted? Disgusting? You tell me. I just think plants shouldn't use their sex \"appeal\" to lure pollenators. Sounds kind of creepy if you ask me.

It was a good movie 7/10. Anyway, on the way to the movie theater, we stopped at the drive-through of a downtown McDonald's. We were waiting for about 10 minutes while the guy at the last window was just sitting there. Finally, the cars start to move, and when we get to the window, they give us our food and 2 free meal coupons because the car ahead of us (the one before the one at the last window)was trying to use counterfeit money. The guy in the car at the last window was nice enough to wait there, thus boxing in the counterfeiting car. They also gave us our order for free (take note that I'm far from poor), which is nice.

After the recital my family went to an auction for a preschool my brother and I went to. I had a good time, and I ate a lot of pasta and desert, not a well-balanced diet. Now, that enjoyment I had last night (today is Sunday) was kind balanced by me getting a mild case of diarrhea. That's okay, it isn't terrible, it's just annoying, though now I have a reason to hate case and effect. Also, today I finished recording my Band Final songs and everything, and I put together a huge Player's Choice package (part of the Band Final). It has a bunch of songs, all of which are awesome. Oh, and Ronald Reagan died yesterday. I'd be sad, except I wasn't alive during his presidency. Weird though, he was an actor, but he spent the last decade fighting Alzhiemers disease. Ah, well.

My dad gave me a 7th grade graduation present early (I saw the other one, too, a new optical mouse, but I have decided to wait till tomorrow to open it and use it. Kind of a ceremonial thing), a hip-hop CD, because I wanted to have a version of \"U Can't Touch This (Hammertime)\" to listen to (note: I was just interested in it; I DID NOT pressure my dad into getting me it. Honest. I'm not a spoiled brat . I am spoiled, though.). The CD also had \"Ice Ice Baby\", \"Baby Got Back\", and \"Whoomp There It Is\". That'll keep me busy. Oh, yeah. While I was looking for \"Hotel California\" on iTunes, so I could preview it (I don't have an iTunes account), I found William Hung's rendition of \"Hotel California\", along with other songs, like \"YMCA\", \"I Believe I can Fly\", and of course \"She Bangs\", on his CD \"Inspiration\". Is it just me, or is William Hung the world's biggest practical joke? Why the heck would anyone give him a record deal, or put him on magazine cover after magazine cover, if not so the whole American public and ultimately the whole entire world could laugh at William Hung behind his back for not having any talent what so ever ? Yes, I know I'm late to jump on the William Hung bandwagon, but don't you agree? This guy ... absolutely ... positively ... completely sucks. At everything. He can't sing, let alone hold a note without going horridly out of tune. He definitely can't dance, and he certainly isn't worthy of a record deal, unless this is a practical joke on the media's part. If it is so that it is a practical joke, and it pretty much has to be, I think we all need to give the mainstream media some applause, don't you think? Getting back to current day events... President Bush is visiting Fort Lewis, WA for Thursday (today) and Friday. This is weird, because ol' Dubya is visiting a place like 4 miles from me (Tacoma, WA), and traffic from Tacoma to Olympia is going to be clogged because that Monkey is coming to my area. Darned. Oh, today is the last full day of school. Tomorrow I get out at 11:10 AM, and then I'll be an 8th grader! Yay? Yeah. YAY! As celebration, we sat in the gym 5th and 6th period (last 2 periods) for \"Activity Day\" (that's field day, accept they put us in the gym, even though we have a PERFECTLY GOOD FIELD!!!)(AND THE FIELD IS NEW!!! THE SCHOOL IS 1 YEAR OLD AND IS IN THE BEST PART OF TACOMA!!! YOU KNOW, THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS NORTH END WHERE EVERYONE IS HAPPY AND CRIME IS ONLY PETTY, AND OF WHICH OCCURS ONLY AT NIGHT!!!

IT WAS GOOD WEATHER, TOO!!!! 85 DEGREES!!! NOT A CLOUD IN SIGHT!!! A SLIGHT BREEZE!!!)(Ugh...) There was a Teacher vs. Student basketball game, which was exciting and fun to watch, and some wacky games some students participated in. Oh, well. Because of this, we didn't have anytime for a vocab. quiz in 6th period (only 10 minutes left in it), and there'll be no time tomorrow, because all of the periods are shortened for the last day of school. OMG (Yes, I'm aware that sounded an awful lot like a girl; let me assure you, this is a time when that expression has to be used. I usually use it when it MUST me used.

It has recently come to my attention that I haven't exactly been paying too much attention to the blog but I've been busy. Today is thursday and I headr Owen's dad was on the news! AWESOME! In Owen's language, YAY! Last Sunday I went to some dumb concert. It had the world premiere of this one guy's fourth symphony. It was pretty darn crappy. Hammertime is a better song then that, and that is sayin' something. Monday, I have no idea what I did (nor does my brother). Tuesday, uuh I forgot that too. But I know exactly what I did yesterday!! Hah! Beat that Owen! Now I remember what I did on tuesday. I had an orthodontist appointment. For the idiots, that means some wacko people messed around with my braces. And yes, I do look sexy in braces. anyway I get to get them off October 14. SWEET!!! Anyway, yesterday I pretty much babysitted the whole day. Here's what I did. First my brother, my mom, and I all walked down to my little soon to be first grader friend Ryan. He's pretty cool, untill you spend a whole day with him. We came back to our house and on the way I ran into some girls I know in the park. I hate Ryan! Especially for that! He's always blowing my chances with girls! Oh well, I like someone else anyway. Anyway we went to my house where we got out a marble track and started playing with that. That was fun for a while untill it got really boring. Then we went to lunch at subway. That was good, I ate their teriyaki chicken, which is my personnal favorite. Then we went to the bowling alley which was fun, but since I have a really nasty blister on my right thumb, I had to bowl left-handed. (I'm right handed if you are too dumb to figure that out). I got an 89 which is pretty good left handed. We did have the bumpers up though, for Ryan, so, there weren't any gutter balls. Then we went to the library and I got a book Owen's dad thought I should read called timeline. I haven't read it yet though. Then we went home and played marbles for a little while. After that we went to Bob The Builder.com. (That site will be the death of me). We played every game, all really dumb and super easy. After that, we played fooseball which I tried to let Ryan win by hitting it into my own goal. I kept winning though. After that we came downstairs and played with lego. I started building a base which is really cool. It has wheels so it can move. And then he left. Finally! So we come to today in which all i've done is spent 45 minutes on this stupid blog, (I can't believe I'm doing this just for Owen.) Well that pretty much says everything about my weekend. Er, summer. Whatever. Doesn't matter. AS LONG AS THERE IS NO SCHOOL!!!!!!!!! YES!! Well I would love to stay and chat but, I have a life unlike Owen and Don't spend all my time wacthing T.V. and playing computer. I only spend most of my time doing those things. Haha. Any way, as a clossing remark, if aanyone actually has the patience to read all this, Owen has the worst, and I mean the worst, grammer in the world. Like in one entry, he wrote something like, \"This CD has everything accept Hammertime.\" It is supposed to be, \"Has everying except hammertime.\" Who actually listens to Hammertime anyway?

Anyway, I am going to reveal the name of my social studies teacher that I really hate (you'd know this from looking at my previous blog urlLink here ) Without any further adieu, Mrs. --- really is Mrs. O'Malley-Hicks! Yes, I said that right! Marilyn O'Malley-Hicks! Truth be told, though, she really is a nice person, and her heart is in the right place, but I think it would be best to point out that: A) Mrs. O'Malley gives out 'social studies' assignments that turn out to either be busywork, artistic assignments, or 1/2 of your grade, B) She turned two of my classmates, Stacie and Elena, into unofficial TA's, making them do all of the work the SHE should be doing (the students are not the teachers), C) She never accurately informed us of deadlines for projects, or even more importantly, if there were any projects assigned, D) She spent so much time yakking and handing out 'creative assignments' (artistic assignments that have almost no guidelines or parameters, yet if not exactly the manifestation of her idea of the perfect rendering of the project, were way of course and were not listened to directions [what directions?]) that the class learned absolutely nothing, and if we did, it wasn't interesting, and E) She is a complete and total loon. She too patriotic for her own good, and she cares too much about people (don't get me wrong: caring about the homeless is a nice thing to do, but at the rate she was going over to the homeless shelter, they were probably barring her from going over there any longer). During the summer, I didn't want Social Studies, because I knew it would be boring (I didn't know who my teacher was, however), but I said to myself, \"Hey, at least we can look forward to learning and Europe (part of the 7th grade Social Studies curriculum) (I think Europe is really cool)\". But, Mrs. O'Malley spends 170 out of the 180 school days jabbering on about the Middle East, Asia, and Oceania. When Mrs. O'Malley promises that she'll give us Europe near the end of school, it just happens to slip her mind (and she said it right before we neared the end of school) and we go off into 8th grade without any learned material about Europe, which some High School teacher is bound to give us a first week of school pop quiz on. Darn. I really hate what Mrs. O'Malley did. Oy vey. Anyway, I saw \"The Stepford Wives\" with Josh and Cam, on Tuesday (6/22). Man, that was FUNNY. Seriously, they purposefully made the movie into a comedy, and they did a fine job of it. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT. Oh, yeah, on Tuesday I started a new Flash movie, which I hope to have done on tomorrow (Thursday) or on Friday. It's really funny, and it's called \"The Chair of Doom\". That's all I'm going to say. Actually, I'll give you one more tidbit: It's using a lot of jpegs. Not one more word about it, my mouth is shut. Okay, back to the real world: I'm going to try out for the Youth Orchestra when they hold auditions in later this summer. I'm going to play \"Menuet from Divertimento in D, K.334\" by Mozart (the good one, W.A.)(yes, it is spelled Menuet this time around). It is a great piece, the trio is a little bit hard, but I think I can nail it with a few weeks of practice (trio as in musically, not with 3 players). Piano is good; I'm playing a Bach prelude. Tenor is fine as always. And now for something completely different. Yes, I meant to take that from Monty Python's Flying Circus. I'm watching more of Monty Python now. Also, talking about sketch comedy, I'm watching some of the SCTV DVD's my Dad got for father's day. Those are great, too. I'm surrounded by comedic masterpieces.

Our counselors were cool (note: Xavier, Max, and Andy were in a different cabin than Josh Fred and I, though their counselors were pretty cool, too). One, Keith, had Perfect pitch, was the Choir piano accompanist, and was from Philidelphia (he's going to Temple University). Keith also really liked Douglas Adams's \"Hitchhikers Series\", so now I'm hooked (I'm 1/4 pf the way through the third installment \"Life, The Universe, and Everything\". REALLY funny stuff.

Our other counselor, Derek, was on Fred, Josh, and I's side of the cabin. Cool guy. Nice guy. Yeah. Made new friends and camp (Monica). Saw some interesting people (2 Goth friends: One's 'name' was Ghost, the other one's was Shade. Turns out Ghost's original name is like Alysia. Who woulda know? During carribean night [Friday] they both had Steel Band workshops so we got to see them preform.

I should have let him burn, but I really like my weekends. So, if you too live with a village of idiots, a ship of fools or a car of morons; please do the kind thing. Shoot them and give me a call. Laterz peeps, PC\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I don't know what to do now. Days seem to get weirder and weirder for me. I keep gettin girls asking me out, i keep getting girls trying to flirt with me, and i keep getting girls wanting to know if i'm single or not. NO NO NO NO i don't need this. i'm doing fine with my girlfriend, and i don't want other people ruining it for me. I don't care what other people think, as long as i'm happy and my girlfriend is i couldn't care much for anything else, I'll end up loosing friends over this, but can't people just leave me be? it's not like i'm a fucking superstar or anything like that is it? i'm just a normal, everyday guy that happens to be in love. Another thing that it getting on my nerves too...Townies. I'll be walking down the road and suddenly some idiot will shout (usually from a car thats moving) \"GOFF!!!\" they don't have the balls to say it to my face. I fucking hate townies, they judge people like me to be 'goffik wrist-slitting satan worshippers' a. i'm not even a goth. b. my wrists are unscarred. c. i don't have any religion, but i was born a christian. They think this just because i wear black alot. So?... do i go round calling them 'idiotic cheap cider drinking pathetic wastes of time'? i don't, but i fucking should do, But you do get some townies that can be good friends, i have about 20 townies friends, but i have about 35 friends that are into metal, it s an underground war. They fight over music they prefer and what the dress in, and i'm on the sidelines. Damon Pollard- \"Goff's like you are scrubbers and can't afford anything\" Ahem, excuse me, but arn't the boots what real goths wear supposed to be around 200 pounds? yeah, thats cheap and really scrubbish isn't it, fuck i'd rather pay that for boots than pay 100 quid for a fucking cap. Neil Whittaker- \"All you goffs are gayboys who are all on the dole\" Err Neil, you need a fucking slap. You'll find most 'goffs' get the pretty girls, and townies are lef with skank that has STD's, only a minority of them are actually gay or bisexual. Most real goth's are on the dole? (work benefit) i've spoke to goths that are 30+ years old and they've got real carrears like doctors and veterans, not shitty garage jobs, or stuck in the army..yes Neil, i know what you've planned. and you Damon, you pair of failures, Damon is headed for the Infantry where there is supposed to be 'loads of different options for him' he'll be patrolling germany for 5 years then he'll be stuck in Iraq, wow, i bet he'll love that, he might get a plastic medal IF he returns, he's already failed the tests once, and he'll keep failing. Neil on the other hand said he wants to stick his nose in lanky damons ass and join aswell...he's too fat, so NOW he wants to work in a butchers and then mover onto plumbing. the butcher part suits him perfectly, he'll be drooling everyday over the enormous amounts of meat and when no ones looking he'll swipe some. Honestly. you two better look in the mirror, slap yourselves and think of what you are. You're a pair of failed lab experiments. So anyways. Things thjat are happening untill the weekend that are ultra important are; Friday- English Lit Exam.

It's pathetic, honestly. I didn't really bother to try and avenge them, but other people did, 2 of them are now in prison, one is in hospital(i think he's out now), and the other moved down south, weird eh? i didn't even ask for anything to happen. well. i think i'll leave it at that for now. -Curly\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I just got a DVD Burner I can do all sorts of fabulous fabulous things with it, actually other than back up my MP3's and finally send off that birthday video to Shannon, I don't knwo what I'll do with it.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I really really should put clothes on, I should get up...

Apparently every year my great aunt and uncle throw a lou-ow, as in coconuts and hawaiin shirts. Just when myself, my aunt, uncles, cousins, and grandma were ready to leave my uncles mini-van doesnt turn over. Two hours later we're on our way, minus my aunt and youngest cousin. Like most family parties it ended up being dull for the most part. As we were walking into the giant tent that was set up in the backyard my uncle slapped my with the designated driver post. If it wasnt for that the party probably would have been much more enjoyable. Because of the hawaiin theme and because that part of the family really likes to go all out; there was even a hula/belly dancer. Obviously that was one of the things that made the party a little more enjoyable. This woman was pretty hot, mabey like a seven and a half. Not sure wether its her really name or not but i think that my aunt mentioned that she went by Bina. In sudden revelation that this is a step away from a pornographic novel, the dancer woman wasn't a stripper, despite that that would have been....interesting. After being forced to sit with the adults for an hour and a half I was finally able to mingle with people that are at least close to my age. My second cousin, for whom the party was being thrown, started introducing me to some of her friends. At this point many of them had been drinking for around eight hours. The entire experience can be summed up with the words of one her teacher friends \"My students know that im a raunchy motherfucker.\" She was an interesting person to say the least. It was because of her that i realized the fact that females apparently get a little footloose after drinking. My second cousins were telling me how perturbed they were when there friend was quasi-hitting on their \"little cousin\" when she stepped out of the room for a moment. It was just this side of being hysterical. So because i have the worst luck in the world, my grandma decided it was time to go home. So at around 1:30 we finally went home just as I was really starting to have fun. .\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "In a time when nothing seems as if it will happen, everything will happen.

Now don't get me wrong, I do love the little girl, but when her family comes and she takes my bead forcing me to sleep on a couch only to force me into an early morning stupor; I'm most definatly going to harbor at least some ill will. Once I was able to stumble off the couch that i had been allocated to like a refuggee to a camp when my cousin invaded my bedroom, my grandma made everyone some great breakfast. If there is one thing about my grandma it is that she loves her food. After lolling around in my well fed catatonic state I followed my usual routine and i went downstairs and hopped on the computer. After poking around for a few minutes I get an IM from Stephanie P. my off and on again girlfriend. The night previous to this there was a school dance, if one can even call it that. Like most things at the International Academy if it doesn't require academics then we suck at it. For most of the dances the guys stand in a corner and don't even make a token effort to dance. But i digress. Getting back to the point, I was not able to go to the dance for two reasons 1) I no longer attend the International Academy and 2) I'm 11 hours away in North Jersey.

Why is it that when you embarked upon this relationship he was so seemingly perfect? Even after the \u201choneymoon period\u201d of your relationship he was so proficient at keeping you lighthearted and content. Now he is just an ass\u2026.. What Happened? Well as we all know the beginning of any relationship is always \u201cpeaches cream\u201d, but what happens when the smoke clears? You see it take anywhere from about 3 months to about 2 years until you really know a person and they really know you. In this time fame of an almost seamless utopia you have both cloaked yourselves as the others perfect match. Now once the veil has been lifted and everything is finally out in the open is when the other side of the same person walks in, almost unknowingly to you until it is too late. You see now that he knows you and has gained your trust he can just about get away with anything, including the bullshit that you said that you would never put up with. How? Now I can\u2019t fully explain how ore why this happens but I will do my best. You see not only male nature but human nature enables us to adapt to just about any situation, even a relationship. It goes down like this, each and every day you get more and more comfortable with each other, therefore you let more things slip through the cracks that are starting to form in your so called perfect world. As he sees this happening he is going to push the envelope more and more, but because you love him and because he was always so sweet you let him slide. By the time reality hits and you figure out what\u2019s really going on you\u2019re ready to kill him. Keep It Interesting... Well don\u2019t jump the gun to fast this can be fixed if you are both willing to change, and just take a little time out for each other. Now from this point on there has to 100% cooperation from both sides it\u2019s gets a little uneasy for some people in the beginning right here, but the one thing that would keep this from happening is communication . The more you and your partner communicate abut what\u2019s going on in the relationship the better it will become, and wonderful thing about it is, it\u2019s almost never to late to start. By having everything out in the open you can keep the relationship interesting, and whenever a problem arises you are both readily able to take care of it. So guys don\u2019t let you pride get in the way because it can get a little emotional, and ladies just take your time with him because he is not going to want to talk about it. Happiness Now the idea of a perfect relationship is kind of fare fetched, it just doesn\u2019t exist, but the idea of a happy relationship is well attainable. Just keep one thing in mind, if you just talk about how the relationship is going and how you feel the possibilities are end less as to how far your relationship will go. Patience serves as a protection against wrongs as clothes do against cold. For if you put on more clothes as the cold increases, it will have no power to hurt you. So in like manner you must grow in patience when you meet with great wrongs, and they will then be powerless to vex your mind.

Yet right beside that lover is a fear of failure, not only of failing his significant other, but also of failing himself. You see I know from experience that emotional agony is a pain that can linger, physical pain is something that you can look past. That emotional pain affects every part of your life it can put you in the deepest of depressions during the happiest of times. Men can not deal with that as well as women, we don\u2019t know how to talk it out, so we find other way of dealing with it which may seem as though we are uninterested. Men shy away from emotion weather it be good or bad, not knowing how to nurture it we just hold it deep down inside. The Hit Run Many people can identify with this one, you both have a great date things are going really well then its back to the spot for a little sumthin mellowsmooth. You\u2019ll have your passionate fun in all it\u2019s lascivious glory, and then not to long after he has to go. You have just fallen victim to the Hit Run. Now before I go any further let me say this is not true for all guys, some have legitimate reason for having to leave like this. After the act of sex a male is at his one of his most emotional states. You can ask him just about anything and his answer will come from his heart and not from his head. The thing is, a lot of guys know this so there for the run from it. Emotion feeling weather they are good or bad are hard for most guys to deal with. Not Interested or Just Doesn\u2019t Care? Many women may question \u201cis he uninterested in me or does he just not care\u201d? Well the answer to that varies from relationship to relationship, but in most cases it is neither. It all goes back to not knowing how to deal with emotions and that fear of failure. Instead of putting ourselves out there we just ball it all up and hold it on the inside and put on this fa\u00e7ade of nonchalant feeling that just act as a shell of true emotions. Help??? Yes there is a way to help, but you have to be patient and you can\u2019t give up. First of all you have to realize that this is going to take some time, it\u2019s not going to change over night. You have to nurture his emotion for him, by doing this he will get some acceptance for himself and learn that emotional pain is only as painful as you make it. Don\u2019t expect huge accomplishment at one at one time, you have to take baby steps on this one it seems to him to be a lot to take in. And finaly, joy and pain are the ying and yang of a relationship share both of these. Without joy there is no pain, and without pain there is no joy. Don\u2019t ball your feelings up because that is just a time bomb waiting to explode. It is better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Ingenious , I have for some odd reason been fascinated with this word, and I can\u2019t really explain why.

Anyway, news flash: According to El Padre, I'm going to be doing most (if not all) of the textual input for this blog. This reduces it from \"The McDaniels (and Arendales) Do San Miguel\" to \"Meagan Does San Miguel with Possibly the Occassional Piece of Commentary from Dad, Except He's Probably Too Lazy to Do Anything but Upload the Zillion Pictures He's Taking, and Even Then, I'll Probably Have to Teach Him How to Do That.\" Oy. But ah well. It's Mexico! Who really cares, eh? 'Sides, you don't mind hearing only one side of the story, do ya? Do ya? Well, you'd better not, so there. Aaaaanyway...Might as well tell you about getting here, cuz that's a whole story in and of itself. --- THE McDANIELS GET TO SAN MIGUEL Well, the first thing that happened was that it took us forever to get packed up and piled in the car. No surprise there. But we'd left the car doors open in the driveway for so long while we were loading our luggage that the battery died, so we had to use Dad's car to jump-start it. Yeesh. We drove to Port Mansfield (sorry if I spelled that wrong) that day and chilled out. I called my folks and my best friend Becky, munched on peanuts, and watched Nick at Nite on the big ol' TV they had in the lounge at the Mansfield Club. Lesse, couple of episodes of The Andy Griffith Show , couple more of The Addams Family , and my first two viewings of Green Acres . Yes, I had never seen Green Acres prior to that. Makes you worry about the world, doesn't it? So Dad decided that we should go out and see the deer feed, which I didn't particularly care about, since I've seen more deer up-close to satisfy me a lifetime. But me, Dad, Laura, and Lizzie drove out anyway. It was too early, so we didn't see any, 'cept a couple. But we did see three turkeys, and a cat, and heard some bob-white quail. Turkeys! Whoo! Back to the Club to eat. Had fish that the Arendales caught; was very good despite being bright green. I think they used green spices on it or something...*shrug* Dunno. But then we just went to bed and got up at six the next day to start driving. That was yesterday. Yesterday was...ooh, bleck. Twelve hours in a car! Well, first we drove across the border, but the place where we were supposed to register the car had no electricity. So we drove around the border of Mexico and found another place, but we didn't have the title of the car. (Don't ask; I don't know. Some paper.) We parked, and Dad and Ben took a taxi back to the States to see if they could get the title faxed to them in a hotel. We could've taken the car back across, but the U.S. customs people prolly would've confiscated all the wine and beef we'd brought. *cough*You didn't read that.*cough* Yeah. So Laura, Lizzie, and I chilled out (metaphorically speaking; it was hot) in the suburban. Laura called her mom in Houston, who went to the house to get the title to try and fax to Dad as soon as his taxi got over the border and he found a place with a working fax machine. (Whew!) Mrs. Morton (sorry if I spelled that wrong too) couldn't work the fax machine, but fortunately Elliot showed up at the house and did it. And while all that was going on, Laura went to go exchange our American money for pesos. Finally, Dad n' Ben came back with like six copies of the Holy Title, and the cab driver that had gotten them through it all led us to the vehicle registration place. All went well there, and we paid the cabbie like $100 (American equivalent). Juan was one happy Mexican, I'm sure. All told, we lost about three hours' time, and were really lucky that things turned out as well as they did. I didn't have a real problem with any of the delay...I was in the parked car the whole time and just sat and wrote. (Journal power! W00T!) We drove straight to San Luis Podaci (yeah, definitely spelled that one wrong) except for one stop for gasoline, which was like seven hours. We kinda got lost in San Luis, but we again paid a cabby to show us the way and made it to the Westin Hotel unscathed. (There were some close calls, though. Fortunately, Laura's an aggresive driver. Or maybe BECAUSE Laura's an aggresive driver...) The Arendales, who didn't have all the mess at the border to contend with, had gone ahead, and we assumed they'd be two or three hours ahead of us. But as it turned out, they got lost at every turn, and showed up at Westin a mere fifteen minutes before we did. Har. Made ME feel better about it, anyway... Westin was a really nice hotel, to put it mildly. Four-star for sure. We all ate dinner (the only real meal of the day) and crashed pretty early. Actually, Ben and I stayed up for a couple of hours watching TV...It was pretty cool. I saw Invader Zim for the first time ever, but it was in Spanish, so I'm not sure I quite caught the plot. One thing's for sure, though...Mexican Gir RULES! But we finally went to bed around midnight or one or something. (There wasn't a clock in our room...strange.) Up at seven, breakfast at the hotel, and then it was back in the car for the last two hours of the trip. Nothing unusual to report about getting into San Miguel. Saw lots of sheep, if that counts for anything...and those low stone walls that farmers used to fence in their livestock hundreds of years ago. Lots of those. Skipping the part about getting here and picking out who was sleeping in what room and all that. Maybe when I have more energy I'll describe the house in Awesome Fiction-Novel-Esque Detail, but I just wanna finish this entry right now so I can nap or swim or something. Maybe nap in the pool...*yawn* Suffice it to say that my first reaction upon entering this house was, \"I died. I fell over and died and now I'm in heaven.\" Seriously. It's THAT awesome. Since we were all hungry from the moving and the driving, we went out to eat at Mama Mia's, the best bar in San Miguel. We had food, of course, not just alcohol. Las quesadillas son deliciosas! Then Lizzie wanted to go to the market, but Dad n' Laura didn't want her wandering around by herself, so I had to go with her. I didn't mind THAT much...I acted like I did, but it was nice to see the town again. And I found the Petit Four, my Swedish patry shop that I walked to every morning for breakfast. Score! ;-) [We interrupt this blogpost to mess around on mIRC. ... ... ... We now return you to our regularly scheduled blog.] But mostly it was just us wandering around lost until we finally called a taxi to take us to the market. By the time Lizzie was done looking around, we were both unwilling to walk home, so we took...yes...a taxi. What is our address, anyway? 62 something that starts with a B. I wanna say Barrios, but I know for a fact that that's not right. Oh well. I'll figure out where I live later. Maybe this wasn't enough of a post, but oh well.

I am not a very accurate or fast typer so any post of mine will not be of the length and quality of daughter number one. Here we go\u2026.. My thoughts on why I love San Miguel. \u00b7 The weather .. it\u2019s as close to perfect as any place I\u2019ve ever been. Yesterday was typical, a bright clear day with a high temperature of 82 degrees and very low humidity. Last night it got down to a cool 55 degrees absolutely perfect for sleeping with the windows open. \u00b7 Waking up at sunrise\u2026. Well Listening to San Miguel awake at sunrise is more appropriate. The random ringing of a church bell off in the distance, the song of the birds as they greet the day, a far off rooster cry, the work truck as it clanks down the cobblestone street, the tinkling of our fountains as the water responds to gravity\u2019s pull, the peaceful glow of the sun as it illuminates my bedroom through our skylight\u2026.. Heaven help me I do love it so. \u00b7 The freedom this place affords my children. They get to experience childhood as I did for a short time. There is virtually no crime, so they are free to leave and wander about all day long without any worries. At night a curfew is all that is required, no need to document their every move. What have we done to America? With all our wealth and affluence, perhaps the truly important qualities of life are missing. \u00b7 A maid, cook, pool man, and gardener, did I mention our own personal cook\u2026\u2026..nuff said. \u00b7 Doing nothing or doing one small thing at a time. I cannot accurately describe how the pace of life here is soooooooooooooo much slower than at home but it really does re-charge my sole. \u00b7 Spending time with my kids. We are forced to be more involved in each other\u2019s lives here in Mexico. There are not the distractions of home that pull everyone in a different direction. A game of rummy-cube replaces TV, a day trip to the hot springs with the kids instead of golf for me, the entire family sitting and talking and watching the sunset together. The elusive \u201cquality time\u201d is found here everyday. Well now you know why I are an engineer and not a novelist. That is all for now I\u2019ll try to post again latter. PS.. I cannot get my E-mail to work, I can receive them but it won\u2019t let me send them.

I ate three. ;-) I think that was before I went swimming...but I don't remember. Who cares? There's no schedule here. Dad's been trying to get everyone set up for their classes and whatnot. He's got Ben all scheduled for guitar lessons, but Lizzie and I are still in the dark. I'm trying to get into a private creative writing session (whoo, big surprise there) and Lizzie wants to do jewelrymaking or something. She's only gonna be here till Wednesday...huge bummer. :-( Dad also decided that we're going to have \"Christmas in July\"...or, as he calls it, \"Feliz Navidad en Julio.\" Notice that he always says feliz Navidad, so it's actually \"Merry Christmas in July.\" Again with the whole \"I'm too relaxed to care\" business... Well, apparently, it works like this: Tonight, or sometime soon, we each draw an envelope that contains a small amount of money and a person's name. We use the money to buy the person a gift, wrap 'em all up, and have 'Christmas' on the sixth. Hey, it works for me. (Note: For whoever gets me, I appreciate gifts that I can eat.) I have no idea what I'll buy no matter who I pick, but that's alright. The market's got lotsa variety. What else? Hm...Oh, yes. Last night around eight-thirty or nine, Alafair (that is how you pronounce it; PLEASE don't ask me how to spell it) and Ben were going out to Charrock (spelling?...), a bar down near the Jardin. They invited me to go, because...well, I don't know. But we went, and I sat around on the third floor with all of the crazy drunk college people, listening to Pink Floyd and trying not to look bored. I did try a sip of beer, since it was two-for-one night on everything, and I actually liked it. But because I liked it, I didn't drink any more. Does that make sense? Not really, but there you go. So the college folks drank and were stupid and drank and got stupider, and I watched the lightning off in the distance and the fireworks that someone shot off at one point. Our \"group\" was a dozen people at four of those little round tables set down in a row, and they christened one the Isla de las Cervezas: the Island of Beer. Every time someone emptied a bottle, it would be \"dubbed\" as a famous person and placed in the appropriate geographic location on the island. I couldn't possibly remember them all, but they included: Dave Letterman, Robert E. Lee, George Bush Sr., Michael Jackson, Fidel Castro, Jim Morris, Howard Taft, Chewbaca (the big hairy brown thing [Wookie] from Star Wars ), Napoleon, and (the one I named even though I didn't actually drink the beer) Elvis Presley. But for me, the evening was really boring. People just drank and smoked and talked politics that were way over my head, and all the smoke gave me a headache. I did get beer spilled all over my leather sandals, but I didn't really care; I've had experience with leather sandals and they can take serious liquid damage. But I decided to leave at ten because I was just bored...and had that headache. Ben escorted me home, and I went up on the roof and hung out with Laura and Lyda (Lida? Laida? Lie-Dah?) for awhile before going to bed. And that was yesterday. Today! Woke up, ate breakfast with la familia , showered, met Katy when she showed up, and edited part of some legal thing for Mr. Arendale. I have to finish editing that, actually...it's open down here on my menu. He gave me my first-ever editing advance of 50 pesos. Additionally, Mrs. Arendale promised me last night that she would throw me my first bookstore signing party whenever I put out my first novel. Add that to the fact that I'm slated to get in touch with a couple of people's friends and relatives who are writers/majoring in creative writing, and you might as well just give me my Pulitzer Prize right now and call it a day. I'm joking, of course, but this is the first time I've ever been taken seriously with this whole writing thing. I like it. *basks in all the glorious head-inflating compliments* But enough about me--let's talk about San Miguel! I think I summarized it best when talking to Jessica online last night, so I'll be even more egotistical and quote myself. She asked, \"So what's it like down there?\" and this is the only way to answer that: \"Freakin' awesome. Weather's perfect, house is gorgeous, food is excellent, schedule is nonexistent, everything's cheap and you're 21 whenever you want to be.\" Seriously. This place is the best thing to ever happen to me. I feel like a different person here; it's home and better than home because I'm actually happy and content. I'd just chalk it up to the fact that here, your biggest concern is trying to decide which of the numerous beautiful places you're going to relax...but there's something else, too. I don't know. The atmosphere, I guess. I know for a fact that I never would've even considered going out to a bar in Lake Jackson or Houston, not because I'm morally opposed to it, but because I just didn't have the self-confidence. And while I didn't have a 'good time' last night, I didn't have a bad time, either, and I'm glad I went. It was interesting. And I got B33R! I can't put my finger on what I'm trying to say. I just...Here, I'm so much closer to being the person I've always seen inside myself than I've ever been before. It's like my soul is being rejuvenated just as much as my body. (Which I am trying to tan, by the way. I mean, it probably won't do much, but as long as you can't see every single vein that's even vaguely near the surface of my skin. I'm creepy-crazy-pasty-white, and I don't like it.) But seriously. This place is...awesome. Awesome awesome awesome. And I think I'm gonna stop now, cuz I do have to finish editing Bruce's thingamabobber, and then I'm gonna keep editing that manuscript I mentioned. And then I'm gonna...Aww, heck, who knows or cares? You don't make plans here.

Katie read a bible verse before we exchanged gifts and the gift exchange was very sentimental, everyone took a lot of time figuring out what their person would like and buying that. Lida cried when Lizzie gave her the gift she had purchased for her, it was a really neat moment. Meagan drew my name and bought me a set of hand carved wood dominoes (destined for the hunting camp), a Limon cello glass, a SMdA shot glass and atop you spin for some type of Mexican drinking game (I\u2019ll probably give that to one of the college kids).

Not that it was bad. Bruce cooked it on the rooftop grill and everything. 4) A salad that Lida made. I don't remember what was in it, but it was good. 5) Cheesecake. I don't like cheesecake, so I didn't eat any, but everyone else seemed to enjoy it a lot. So I guess it was good. We had to \"dress up\" for dinner, which for me was just some nice pants and a collared zip-up shirt. Dad blessed the food, we ate it, and then we moved into the second living room for gift-giving. Avery had the video camera, Dad had the digital camera, and Lizzie had the basket with everyone's names in it. We'd elected Katy a few days ago to read a Scripture passage, and I wish I could remember which one it was, but I can't. It's from one of the Corinthians or something...It was the \"love is patient, love is kind\"...etc...\"and the greatest of these is love,\" one. 'Twas nifty. Then we had the gift-giving. Lizzie would draw a name, and that person would get the gift they got for their person and give it to...well, their person. Uhh...that's confusing. Lemme try that again. Lizzie drew herself first, so she gave her presents to Lida. Got it? Yeah...So we just did that until everybody got their presents. I'm not going to list them all, because I'm lazy like that, but Bruce got Laura a wooden cross, and Katy got me some lil' jewelry items and such, and Laura got ben a cologne bottle that looked like a silver Cuban cigar case. And other stuff. Most people got more than one present, since we each had 200 pesos (roughly $20) to spend. The only thing we didn't do was let Ben give Alafair her present, because she was sick. As soon as it was all over, me n' Avery went to bed, because that's what we do. I'm glad we're roommates, cuz we both hate staying up and out and all of that. OK, that was Christmas. (Ben gave Alafair her present the next morning.) We still haven't taken down the tinsel, I think, at least not the tinsel on the bongos. Hee-hee...Christmas bongos...That's very cool. But now we move on to yesterday, which was when Ben gave Alafair her present. After that, Dad told me yet again that I needed to get out of the house and do something...because...I've just been hanging out here the whole time. Normally, the idea of leaving would bother me, because I'd be working on my website or something...But I had to e-mail one urlLink Laurel Edwards about the name of my site (don't ask; too long of a story) so until I get her reply, I'm halting all construction. This left me with nothing to do yesterday but edit my fanfic manuscript. And since Dad said I had to go somewhere... There's a Swedish pastry shop waaaaaay downtown on the end of Mesones street called The Petit Four. It's connected to a cafe called Pancho and Lefty's; I think Dad uploaded a picture of the interior awhile back. Two years ago, I found The Petit Four and journeyed there every morning for a snack (no easy feat, mind you). I figured that sitting in tiny pastry shop in Mexico munching on a handmade treat and editing the manuscript of a story was just about the most writerly thing I could do, so...I did. Dad lent me one of his old leather computer cases for this trip so my laptop wouldn't get banged up on the car ride down here. It has this one pocket that's the perfect size for my manuscript, so I put that in there and my red \"Second Edit\" pen. Then I figured that it would be silly for me to carry that thing all the way down there if all that was in it was thirty-five pieces of paper and a pen, so I threw in my journals and every pen, pencil, and highlighter that I brought. Satisfied with all of my useless baggage, I followed Laura down to the market; we parted ways at what I call the \"fake Jardin\" and I walked down to The Petit Four. This was around...hm, I'd say three o'clock. So I got there, picked a table, settled down, and bought myself a fruit cup. It's a bunch of fruit in gelatin in this...cookie-ish cup thing. There was canteloupe, kiwi, strawberry, blueberry, apple, orange, pineapple, and other yumminess. So I ate that, then whipped out my Manuscript o' Doom and edited. I wanted to get all the secondary editing done three days before I left so I could have time to key in all the changes, and in order to do that, I calculated that I'd need to get all the way to page 48. That way I'd only have to do two pages a day until it was time to key in. So I edited and edited...and edited...and got to page 48...and turned around...and it was pouring down rain outside. Now, I must explain that when you're occupied with reading, or writing, or editing, or anything of that nature, sudden and dramatic changes in the weather do not come to your attention. I watched the street turn into a river before shrugging nonchalantly, because if I know nothing else, it is this: If you are going to be trapped by heavy rainfall somewhere in the middle of Mexico, a quaint Swedish pastry shop is a freakin' good place to get trapped. \"Hmm, looks like I'm stuck here. At least I have my manuscript, and money. I don't wanna spend any more, though, since I already bought a...Ooh! 100 grams of miniature nut-and-chocolate-chip cookies for two and a half bucks? SW33T!\" So I just edited some more and waited for the rain to let up. Around page 52, I got to wondering how long I'd been out, so I decided to go home anyway. It wasn't raining any more, really; the streets were just flooded. So I packed up and headed out, trudging along the sidewalks (where available) and through the ankle-deep water where I had to cross intersections. Fortunately, I was wearing shorts and leather sandals, so I didn't damage anything. (Trust me, dude - leather sandals can take huge amounts of liquid abuse. Said it before, sayin' it now, and will probably say it again.) Well, when I reached the \"fake Jardin,\" I decided to take a cab, because I wasn't entirely sure of the way back. Then I had to figure out the front door, which took a moment, since you turn the key counterclockwise to unlock. But I finally got in, and it was a quarter till six. And that was my adventure for yesterday. We went out to eat last night, but I'm absolutely starving right now, so I'm not going to tell you about it. I've taken to not eating breakfast, not only because I usually sleep through it (it's around 8:00) but because my tourista acts up the worst in the morning. But now it's 1:34, time for lunch, and I'M HUNGRY. So I think I'll go downstairs and see when lunch is supposed to be, and probably eat, and do more editing. I've discovered the power of sunscreen, so the roof is no longer dangerous. (I've been up there every day and have burned myself because of it.) So I'll see you folks around. Adios, amigos! P.S. I'm gonna call Mom today to see if I can stay an extra week, past the 23rd. I mean, why am I leaving on the 23rd? Originally it was cuz Kristin had something to go to, not me. So why the heck do I have to leave a week early? I REFUSE! I'M STAYING HERE FOREVER!!!

This'll be quick. I can't remember when I last posted, so you'll just have to settle for what went down today. Around noon, we (the Arendales, the McDaniels, and Ben's friend Taylor) drove out to a town called Dolores Hidalgo to shop for pottery, or something. We had this really good meat at a restaurant there first thing off. I want to call it barbecue, but there was no barbecue sauce...it was more like tacos. And gorditas. And guacamole. And stuff. After eating, we tromped around and looked at a bunch of pottery and antiques and churches. None of it was particularly interesting to me, so I'm not going to describe it. If you want that, make somebody else post, cuz you're getting one side of the story here whether you like it or not. Actually, I will mention the ice cream, cuz it was good. There was this little stand outside one of the churches selling homemade ice cream, and...uh, well, it was really good. That's all there is to say about it. I got the \"Vanilla Special\"...it was like butter pecan with a hint of cinnamon. Very rich. So after the ice cream, we headed out to some church in the middle of nowhere because it's one of the top ten restoration projects on Earth, or something like that. It started with an A, but I can't spell it...Atonta-somethin'. There was a cat chillin' in the altar, which was kind of funny, but that covers it. But it took us forever to actually get to the place because Lida n' Laura n' Katy n' Alafair (n' Taylor) wanted to look at antiques and stuff on the side of the road. I will never, ever see the virtue in antiques, but hey, we can't all be perfect. We finally got home like forty minutes ago, but I've just now been able to get online. And I've got other things to do, so I'll see you folks later. Maybe Dad'll upload some pictures for you or something. Adios. P.S. Sorry if this post sounded grumpy; I just didn't get anything out of today.

Lesse...We've gone on several excursions the past few days, though \"we\" is usually two adults and three kids. Dad, Bruce, Ben, Taylor, and I sought out some Mayan (Aztec? Inca?) ruins, but never found them, instead taking a four-hour detour through the middle of nowhere and seeing some interesting things. A dam in a canyon, a hole-in-the-wall village with chickens running through the yards, and a beautiful church in a town of a hundred people were a few of the things we stumbled across. Yesterday, the Arendales (sans Katy; she left for a few days) and I went to a market on the other side of town, just to check out what it was like, but it was mostly produce and clothes. And several days ago, we all went to this gorgeous ranch where some millionaire's going to build a golf course. Personally, I liked it the way it was. Actually, we were supposed to go to a glass factory, but we got there like half an hour late and missed our tour. So we went to the ranch instead. Now what? Um...Taylor left yesterday. Katy's coming back...er, soon. Tomorrow, or something. Lizzie's been at camp for a week, or a bit more. As far as what everybody's up to...well, I can't tell you for sure. Alafair and Bruce are taking a sculpting class; both are making fish of some sort. Avery rides horses every morning. Dad does whatever Dad does. Laura and Lida go shopping. Ben hangs out with a bunch of girls he's found. And I...Well, if we're not doing something interesting, I'm in my room, writing HTML code or some such nonsense. I brought my computer up onto the roof one day to work, but the glare was such that I could hardly see the screen. Don't get me wrong; I love being in Mexico, but web design is just so much fun! Seriously! Who would've thought it, eh? At any rate, I can't believe our time here is halfway spent. That's insane. I feel like I live here. Okay, I do , but not literally. However, if home is where your heart is, then I do indeed live here year-round. It's just so...so....Not perfect (no place is), but so close to perfect. You know? No big-city pollution or shopping malls or glitz or glamor or stress anything like that. Just...life, diluted to its purest form. Again, it's not perfect (for one thing, the Internet connection is really spazzy) but hey, it's close enough for me. Okay, that's enough.

First, we eat like Kings, the cook prepares breakfast and lunch everyday. A typical breakfast is fruit (papaya, strawberry, pineapple, banana) Huevos rancheros, bacon, toast, fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee. Lunch the other day was poblano chilies stuffed with spicy meat, grilled Portobello mushroom caps stuffed with spinach, and a tossed salad. At night we eat out at the excellent restaurants all over town. We typically walked to dinner via the Jardin to see what is going on there. The entire social life of San Miguel centers around the Jardin or town square. After dinner it is back to the Jardin to see what is happening. The other night I hired a Mariachi band to serenade Laura and me. She was kind of embarrassed but she got over it and really enjoyed it I think. We have taken some driving day trips out into the country that have been a lot of fun. The kids especially have enjoyed seeing the peasants toiling in the fields. I hope it will help them appreciate how good they have it. Meagan is completely absorbed with HTML programming. She has taught herself computer code and is building her own website from scratch. I have to insist she gets out and goes sightseeing with me at least once a day or she would never leave the computer. Ben is girl crazy. He met three girls from San Antonio and is panting around with them, showing them way too much attention. We have tried to explain to him to play it cool and act like he is not that interested, but he just can\u2019t make himself do it. This morning he informed me that \u201cWomen are impossible. They are so weird.\u201d I hope he truly has learned that, because I still forget it, and assume women periodically think like me.

It cools it off from 80 to 72 and then quickly goes away leaving no trace of rain 30 minutes after it has stopped. The weather is absolutely perfect here.

Let the cheesy Emeril references begin, cuz Lida, Laura, Katy, Alafair, Avery, Patrick (Katy's boyfriend) and yours truly took A Cooking Class today! I think I was the only person besides Patrick who'd never been; everyone else had gone two years ago or four years ago or five years ago or whatever. There's this eccentric (but very cool) lady named Patsy who has a house outside of town and gives cooking classes, wherein you all show up for five hours and make comida. (That's \"food,\" children. Study your Spanish!) Avery woke me up early this morning so I could shower before we left - thanks, Avery. Patsy showed up at the front door at 9:45, and we took two cars out to her house, which we probably never would have found without her. She's got two houses, actually, but she rents out the old one and lives in the newer one. Neither are big, but the newer is approximately 75% kitchen, which makes it suitable for giving cooking lessons in. I suppose that was the point. At any rate, we got there and immediately got our hands dirty, preparing to make roasted pork, tamales, Aztec pie, chips, and chocolate chip cookies. I'd never heard of Aztec pie before today, but it's pretty much thus: Take everything you'd ever want to put on a tortilla chip. Layer it. Throw some whipped cream (not the sweet kind!) on top. And that's an Aztec pie. We're talkin' beans, guacamole, salsa, cheese, and all that jazz. So we started cooking! We did everything from shucking the corn to shredding the chicken to roasting the peppers to frying the chips to grinding the tomatoes to dicing the onions to blending the tamale paste to feeding the chickens! OK, it wasn't entirely relevent, but still. I got to feed the chickens! Patsy had chickens. Lots and lots of chickens. I'd say there were forty or so. There was a pen for them, but I guess that was just for at night, cuz they ran around all over the place most of the time. They lay eggs that she cooks with, and she feeds them all the food scraps (like corncobs and stuff). I got to take the bucket out there and dump it in the pen for all the chickens to eat. Heee! Chickens! I love the chickens! Anyway, we cooked for, like...four hours. We also went n' saw her old house, but Avery and I didn't stay long, cuz it was small and Avery had been there before. But our main entertainment (when we weren't preparing something) was flywatching. Patsy said that flies always proliferate before it rains. Well, I suppose she was right, because there were flies all over her kitchen. We're talking by the dozens. They'd land on anything they could, but if there was no real food out, they'd go for the two little plates of bait she had out...It was a combination of water and Snip, the stuff you rub on horses to keep the flies off. It works really fast, and it was extremely amusing to watch the flies die. They'd land, take a sip or two, walk around--then just freeze. Usually they'd fall over dead a few seconds after that, but some put on a show. This one fly - we called him Superfly - stayed alive for a good two minutes after eating the Snip, spasming and trying to buzz away. This other guy, the Spinner, spun around insanely fast for the longest time before dropping dead. Like, think of how fast a fly flies...then imagine one all spazzy so that it tried to fly with one wing and just keep going in circles. That's how fast he was spinning. Bet he got dizzy. (Look, people, you had to be there...) Anyway, we cooked n' cooked n' watched flies die n' cooked n' cooked and finally all the food was ready. We ate...and ate...and sat outside and talked...and ate. And it was good. Los tamales son muy buenos! (Or is it las tamales son muy buenas? *sigh* That's the problem with Spanish - everything has sex.) But eventually we got done eating, and packed up the rest to take home. It was great fun. Lots of work, but great fun. Besides, it's cooking, which is always rewarding. You get food! Who can resist food, eh? Not me, that's for sure!\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I posted today about yesterday, but since Dad put up so many pictures, you can't see it on the right. Just scroll down to find it. Anyway, some quickie updates. I have officially read two books this entire summer! Yay! You'd think that I'd be reading constantly...and I am. It's just never books anymore. I'm too lazy to go out and get them , y'know? But Alafair had a copy of Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf, so I read that yesterday. And Laura was reading Angels Demons by Dan Brown; I picked it up two days ago and read the first hundred pages, then finished it today. Angels Demons is the prequel to The Da Vinci Code, for those who don't recognize the name. Personally, I likedA better than Da Vinci Code ...maybe because more people die. Like, way more people. In fact...*counts*...ten, I think. There were probably more that I can't remember right now. But at least ten. My only gripes with the book are thus: 1. It's structured so similarly to DVC that you'd swear you were reading it over again on occassion. All the characters seem carbon copies of the ones in the other book, except that only Robert Langdon is actually the same person. The others are stereotypes:sexy sidekick braniac chick whose mentor male elder relation was murdered (grandfather in DVC,adopted father in A); stern, gets-in-Langdon's-way-a-lot head-honcho military guy; crippled guy who's really important to the plot; freaky-deakystrongman assassin operatingfor mysterious organization whois obsessive-compulsively devoted to his cause anddoes all the killing/grunt work;etc. There's even a \"follow the clues hidden in artwork to get to the secret lair of ancient underground organization\" thing...except it's the Illuminati instead of the Knights Templar or Holy Grail, and statues instead of paintings. It's more of a thriller, less plausible than DVC, and thusmore exciting...but still. A lot is the same. 2. What's up with Robert Langdon and younger women? I think Dan Brown's just fantasizing in bothA and DVC. I mean, c'mon - sexy genius chicks are not gonna wanna hook up with a 40+ art history teacher/symbologist, even if he is from Harvard. At least Brown got better at it...DVC ends with a scene wherein Langdon and Sophie pretty much decide their relationship can't work, and there's some unexpressed sexual tension. (At least, that's what I seem to remember.) ButA just ends with Langdon and Vittoria (that particular book's genius sidekick chick) shacking up. Actually, it ends with Vittoria making some stupid I-am-a-yoga-master-revel-in-my-thusly-awesome-sex-skills joke. *facepalm* So retarded. You're a little too obvious for me, Brown; Vittoria was too strong a character to fall for Robert Langdon. The guy wears a Mickey-freakin'-Mouse watch, for crying out loud! OK, OK, enough ranting from me. Other than those two points, I advise reading Angels Demons. I'll say about it what I said about Da Vinci Code: bad writing, good plot. Good thriller writing, I suppose, but as far as craft goes...bleh. Anyway, I'm a bit red because I laid out reading for several hours and lightly toasted myself. I don't mind or anything - I did it on purpose, and I'm not uber-sunburned or peeling or anything. (Tanned! Tanned! I must get tanned!) I also wanted to go to the Petit Four today, but Angels Demons ate my afternoon, so I'll just go tomorrow. Hooray for lax Mexican scheduling. Well, that was the Books. \"Bites\" refers to the fact that Bruce got the tip of one of his fingers bitten off by a horse. And that's Reason #17 why I don't like horses. Seriously, though...I don't think it's that bad, except for the fact that he lost the tip of his finger. I dunno if they saved the joint or not; he's staying the night in the hospital to make sure it doesn't get infected. It was too chewed up and gross to reattach, but hey, it could've been a lot worse. He coulda lost his whole finger or somethin'. (Will give more details when I get them. Actually, I know more than all that right now, but I'm too lazy to tell you.) And \"Boyfriends\" would be Mike. No, not my dad; Alafair's boyfriend Mike. He came down today and is staying till...when? Sunday evening? Eh, I dunno. He doesn't look like I thought he would; neither does Patrick. No one ever described either of them to me, so I suppose it makes sense that they don't look like I thought they would, but still. I didn't get to say more to Mike than \"hi,\" so I can't tell you about him. Ask Alafair. Or maybe just ask Mike. That'd work too. *yawn* Well, I'm tired, and am going to bed.

We walked around, had crab cakes and went to the urlLink Aquarium . I love the aquarium there and haven't been for years. Ross has the pictures on his camera of all the urlLink Sting Rays !

Drive a car, skateboard, rollerblade, but apparently they walked everywhere in his town so no need to bike. Since I love to go biking he decided it was due time to learn, and well he's a natural. Just look for teh 6'6\" guy on the bike. So both Rossnami and I had interesting Dr. appointments, my ending with a NEW HORRIBLE hospital visit soon. But then I won't need all those meds. It's funny when you think that science should be able to find out why and how things come about but then the dr sits there and says \"no one knows how this happens\". Yay, but no biggie, it's not cancer or life threatening, or a VD, just my body going all silly. So make sure to take ur probiotics or else ur immunity goes all interesting.

We got there around 10:00am and met up with other urlLink Ramapo Students listened to speakers such as Hilary Clinton and then Marched on Washington at 12:30pm. After completing the circle which took about a hour and a half we sat and listened to speakers from all over and from such organizations such as NAACP, and celebrities and the like. Well it's true many people feel strongly about this March for Women's Lives but why do I do this? (prepare for rant till links below - i've had better but its early right now) They consider urlLink Emergency Contraceptive to be an Abortion by THEIR RELIGIOUS VIEWS. I do not. All Pro-Lifers just have this religious stance, and well not everyone is Christian, not everyone follows your God and I certainly don't! And well, \"If you don't believe in abortion, Don't have one\" I believe what I would choose for myself is not what others would choose. I would not, nor have I ever had an abortion. But some people can not pay for BirthControl, some people can not pay for the Pregnancy Test, and some people can not pay to have the abortion or to take the time off work to have the child, or even to pay for the child once in this world. So I believe that it is for them, to make abortion more accessible and to make REAL SEX ED more accessible. I do not aggree with our funding to be dedicated to Absitinence, I believe teaching prevention and knowledge is the best way. I do not think it should be a choice between eating dinner that week or getting an abortion. It should be a private issue. I do not think WHITE MEN should decide WHAT IS OKAY FOR MY BODY. It is my CHOICE, do not decide my choice and everyone elses based on your own choices. And how dignified can you be waving baby fetus' around. They weren't your's and they are not from abortions they were form late term miscarriages. Could you imagine being that Mother's whose unborn child that is getting waved around at Marches. It is okay to give birth to a child, it helps feed the war machine. It is okay to kill SONS AND DAUGHTERS once fully grown in WAR. So long as we have enough BODIES to send over THEN ITS OKAY?! I am a Catholic Anti-War Pro-Choice college student. It makes more sense for me to have abortion, I do not believe EC kills a child, I do not think in 72hours that is a child. I still have the choice. They are Pro-Choice so that they can kill whatever 18 and up person they can find. Carring a DEAD SOLDIERS picture would be illegal!

Now I am totally confused cuz two minutes ago he was mad at me, and now he's like cracking jokes. I start laugh/crying and all a sudden everything is great and I'm getting ready. I didn't know what to do, he totally tricked me and it was great but, wow someone shouldn't have the power to do that! It was cute and I love him!!!

Saw yoga, went to VVA (first time ever), belly dancing, coffee house, rcore, WSAWSR and then drank martinis and chilled w/ the roomies and friends. Was a very very active day and I liked it. To bad it's still cold, but ATLEAST it is sunny. Also had trouble speaking... I was thinking and speaking but there was no way I could prevent one or the other from coming out. So I was thinking what I should be doing or about a conversation, and I would say a portion out loud while talking to whoever it was I was speaking with. So I ended up calling Ross Hubby, and I think I made a tons others. It was my brian's off day I suppose. Just hope not to many random people noticed... that sleep walking is a def. problem. And now I'm at work! I had a day off class so I decided to cover for a co-worker, smart right, should have slept in... So on with my story..... So this friend of mine from home is telling me over the phone his story of the time he went to D.C. to protest WTO (which is what rcore is doing) \"So I walk into the cell and the cop is known by name to the 20 people that are there so I think 'regulars\". And when the cop leaves a Puerto Rican guy says, 'Another white boy, I'm gonna fuck you up.... nah I'm just kidding.\" A conversation begings and they ask why he's in there. 'I am in here for protesting urlLink World Trade Organization , they said I assualted a police officer'. (he threw a bean bag that hit him and it by accident hit a cop that was clubbing him at the time). And the Puerto Rican guy, Pablo, says 'You got balls protesting, you have a house and a job, wtf do you have to complain about'. Good point my friend notes, 'But I am protesting so we have more jobs, so everyone can have a job'. Pablo responds, 'Yeah they are jobs no one wants, what do you think?, like i would want to work in fucking urlLink Bopal !'. An obvious well educated guy who has more knowledge than the common college student. And they are in there for a while so might as well keep company...

Saturday Ross and I worked our asses off all day getting the garden together and then Sunday I did the Easter thing w/ my Dad and Sisters, then dinner with my Mom and John. I took my sister out Saturday for her 13th Birthday Dinner, she's a cheap date. Went to Charlie Brown's and she had fries and the salad bar, no wonder she keeps so thin. But it was fun to talk and do the sister thing. We also made cookies together at 11pm, woke Dad but what ya gonna do, it was fun. I really do love my sisters so much. The garden looks great, it really is cool working so hard on something and seeing it grow to be something beautiful. We have LOTS of mint, so much, but a few flowers like Roses and my favorite, Bleeding Hearts. Did a lot of thinking, yes me!, about everything. It may be odd but I act out conversation senarios that will never happen with people I prob will avoid or just not see. Never works out the way I want to, mostly because I lack the balls to say really mean things or stand up for myself. This usually happens in the shower cuz it is my only alone time and well started because I was always mad at my parents and couldnt very well tell them what I was really thinking. I came up with this thought, I didn't know I had. Since I talk in my sleep I have these amazing conversations with Ross and I do not remember because they are my dreams I forget by morning. So my thought was that life is like a tree. We start small and each experience branches out and becomes more developed or as Ross said I said, \"each decision we make leads to another branch, one dies and one grows. what we get is a bit irregular but its beautiful when it's done\". I guess I will never really know. And one time after the Matrix Revolutions I sit straight up in bed and say, \"I get it, the real reason we all live is to die\", and then back down to snoring I go. Silly, I am a deeper thinker in my sleep. Interesing site . I don't know why people dig these chicks, but they do and well it's sorta disturbing.

So of course they run into alot of Ramapo students cuz our school has to be gay and let spring break come so late and well our school sucks at schedules. So even when I go on Spring Break I run into every Ramapo student there. But my vacation will be different! Oh so much boozing there will be! Well I'm beat, and Ross's radio show is over soon, and I'm missing him already!

YUM FOOD. Went shopping today for my sister's BirthDay !!! She is 13 ! How amazing and scary. And if anyone so much as looks at her the wrong way, I'll break their fecking knees. Eh sometimes I still feel alone and lost. We only get so many chances in life, and how many of them have we given up on?, or how many have been given up for us? I think no two people can love eachother equally, one will always love the other more or less. I do not think true love felt equally between people can be had. A Mother will love her child more, or will not love the child at all. One friend will always take advantage over the other. And one lover will always think it's nicer that the other loves them more, and the other will just be so in love as not to notice the un-equality. So there is not equal true love, always the scales will bend this way and that, and no equal hate for that much, but there will always be equal feelings on nutrality but never of strong emotions such as love and hate.So many missed chances, so many chances I was never given. Never was I given the chance when I was willing to take it. These moments of meloncholy piss me the fuck off. Damn thinking Damn it all. Sometimes being stupid seems more like a blessing I woudl rather have. Sometimes, but then again being a drooling idiot would make me so much more like the idiots I long ago left behind. And why can we not leave all the past behind, something always lurks behind the bends... always. Maybe I'm not the only person to feel upset, infact I know it. Maybe I am not the only one who was screwed over, and I know I did my fair share of fucking things up myself. The fact that I cheated on more exes than I ever admitted to them, (aside from one pete and my current boy who doesnt count ross) worries me, and the fact I broke them off always, and yet I have this fear of getting cheated on, left and broken up with. I know I was always out to get them before they get me, but they were assholes who ended up doing their fair share also in the end. I feel I've met the first person I trust the most ever, and hence the no problem. I know I have this fear of commitment and this fear of being alone, but I try to deal with those two total oposites, I found someone who I can talk to about anything and just understands me more than anyone, which is amazing. Life isn't so bad, DEATH THE HIGH COST OF LIVING ...

Sometimes I look back and think how stupid I was to do a certain thing, like why couldn't I see the implications then. To be used or to just be blind about ANYTHING. You learn from mistakes, but it seems I keep making the same ones over and over again. Give people to many chances, or trust. But that's what you are supposed to do, trust, give, it's some sort of fucked up paradox I exist in. I feel like those cartoon characters or like Neo in the Matrix.

I was minus 3 today, that was good. It's odd how we thinking in more and less, plus and minus all the time. You need more, need less. Loose weight, gain wealth. One giant scale we endlessly try to even out. Good, bad. Someone so rich had to loose something to gain that money. Someone so poor had to gain something by loosing all that wealth. But that doesn't quite work. You can never have it all but you sure as hell can loose it, how can life go so off balance? Eh, BladeRunner's got me all thinking. All we are, Memories.

It was yips \\YIPS\\ (noun) : a state of nervous tension affecting an athlete (as a golfer) in the performance of a crucial action. Example sentence: Faced with a critical putt in the final round of the golf tournament, Janet got a bad case of the yips, but she hung onto her concentration and made a birdie. Did you know? Who first dubbed an athlete's stress under pressure the \"yips\"? We're not sure. We also can't say for certain if this plural noun has anything to do with the singular \"yip,\" a word of imitative origin meaning \"a short bark (as of a dog).\" All we really know is that sportswriters have been using \"yips\" since 1962 and that it most often appears in golf-related contexts. Jen had sent it as a reminder of days of old. We used to make a yipping sound during our Earth Science class. We were trying to imitate those aliens on THE MUPPET SHOW but it came out to praire dog yips. Good times... Also ran into another thing Jen sent me... urlLink Secrets Every Woman Keeps from Her Man ... by a Kathryn Eisman (this is a long one). Some of it is true, Some of it isn't. Like the butt or hands thing...but some are scarily true isn't that great!: 1) My best friend knows everything. She knows all of your vitals -- from the size of your bank account to the size of your other, um, holdings -- and she knows how both compare with those of every other man I've ever dated. I have done a hand-comparison measurement so I can divulge size and girth with a high level of accuracy. When my friend smirks at you knowingly, you are not imagining it. She knows. So just know that she knows, and deal with it. (It's not going to change.) Ask her about me, or chat with her about our relationship, at your own risk. She will tell me. Even -- in fact, especially -- if she promises not to. This is not always a bad thing (e.g., if you happen to be telling her how much you love me). But, in general, remember that she is my confidante first, and yours never. 2) Just looking at your hands can turn me on. 3) When you go away, even for a day, I sleep in your favorite old T-shirt because it smells like you. 4) I'll never tell you exactly how many men I've slept with. No matter how sincere I appeared when I answered your question, chances are I wasn't. As an unscientific guideline, when a woman says she's slept with four men, the real number is actually closer to seven. Her fib is partly intentional (she doesn't want to appear a floozy), but mostly it's sexual amnesia. When a woman wants to pretend an encounter never occurred, she simply scraps the man from her official score sheet. Common excuses that lead to such an omission: The actual sex lasted only a few thrusts; or she was drunk or on the rebound. 5) I fantasized about being with you at least a dozen times before we actually first got naked. 6) I still think about my ex-boyfriends and compare them to you. Mostly you win. Sometimes not. 7) I have Googled your exes. 8) When I'm falling in love with you, I completely lose my appetite. 9) My body really isn't naturally this hairless and smooth all over. But I will never allow you to see any indication whatsoever of all the shaving, tweezing, waxing, exfoliating, and moisturizing that gets it this way. 10) I only appear to have it all together. My true organization (or lack thereof) is revealed in my closet, my makeup bag, my desk files. 11) I have discovered your porn stash and your frequently visited porn Web sites and think the things that turn you on are hilarious. 12) When I say, \"I'm ready,\" I'll need exactly 7 more minutes to get ready. Don't try to cheat the system by showing up 7 minutes later; I will still need an extra 7 minutes. 13) When I say, \"I'll meet you in 15 minutes,\" I mean I will leave in 15 minutes, and thus won't actually arrive for at least 30 (but probably more like 40). 14) You've made me cry more times than you'll ever know. 15) I obsess about when you're going to call me again. The period of time between our first date and your \"Thanks for a great night; when can I see you again?\" always seems stretched into slow motion. So don't worry about looking too eager. Call. Even if you only wait until noon the day after, it will feel like a lifetime to me. And don't send me an e-mail unless you want me to put you in the figurative trash can along with your message. 16) I want you to talk a little dirty. 17) At the beginning of our relationship, I save all of your voice mails and listen to them (and make my friends listen, too), repeatedly. 18) I might wear granny underwear and purposely not shave my legs because I like you. As crazy as it sounds, the more I like you, the less likely I am to sleep with you on an early date, because I don't want to sabotage having a \"proper\" relationship with you. So I just might purposely hunt out the ugliest underwear in my drawer and not shave my legs -- all to prevent myself from getting naked with you too soon. Sometimes I might get a little tipsy or carried away, and this plan will backfire. 19) I split the cost of my fashion purchases over two or more credit cards, so you don't notice the gargantuan deficit. 20) I'm constantly testing you. I observe, analyze, and judge every action, word, gesture, e-mail, and facial expression. When I ask you if you want to have a threesome, I don't mean it. If you want me to speak to you again, let alone sleep with you after this conversation, the answer should always be, \"Why would I want to sleep with another woman when I have you?\" 21) I check out your butt every time you leave the room. 22) I need constant indications that you want me around. That's why it's better, for example, to say, \"I want you to come away with me for the weekend. Could you come with me?\" than to ask, \"What are you up to this weekend?\" 23) I love it when you get a little jealous. So if you ever see me flirting in front of you with the waiter, the bus driver, or another guy at a party, know I'm actually flirting with you -- through him. 24) Even though I may complain that I don't see you enough (or that you work too hard), I find nothing sexier than watching you put on a suit in the morning and rush off to work. <----no, just like it when u leave me the f*ck alone 25) I start fights with you because I'm feeling ignored. I'm trying to force emotion out of you. Don't retreat into your cave; just give me what I want: some attention. And never tell me to \"calm down,\" unless you want to guarantee that I absolutely won't. 26) Even if I insist on paying or splitting the bill on our first date, I'll think you're cheap if you let me. 27) I may find your best friend repulsive, but I've fantasized about sleeping with him. Not because I want him, but because I want a piece of a guy who is so close to you. <---haha no.... 28) If I'm going to break up with you, all of my friends know way before you do. I've been talking about it for 2 weeks. 29) When we do break up, I put all photographs of you and mementos of our relationship in a shoe box and store it in my closet. Just in case I get nostalgic. Just in case you come back. <---haha it burns pretty colors oh and ebay \"consider it asshole tax\" 30) I want you to take control in bed. Yes, I have a successful career, I'm financially independent, I live on my own, and I don't need a man to make me happy (in theory). I still want you to pick me up, carry me to the bedroom, and take without asking. <--- money is good too.... i'm in college! Well work has to start some time!

It must have been an off week where he felt that pissing me off would take to much effort. Needless to say I am happy now and with someone without major mental or erectile dysfunctions. And on a side note it isn't the size so much as how to use it but when u do not have the size or the know how.. well then... ur my psycho stalker ex who after a year really has to let go. Lets face it only six months were good and that's because you were faking u werent psycho, the three months after where you werent around were even better!

You should be happy for your partner that they are doing well and support them in whatever they do, regardless if it makes money or not. It's always okay if your a struggling artist, but a female successful artist will have trouble finding a man because of their stupid insecurities.

I was there in an hour and a half, and ever sucker on the parkway and turnpike had to wait 3hours to get to Red Bank. So we went to urlLink Headliners after chilling around town. It was great, but very different from off season (duh). Very nyc crown there, and man it was crowded. I remember people stepping on my feet but the huge bruise on my foot must have happened after I had the mind earaser. All those red bulls and V (5) made me very energetic, but we had a blast dancing.

I started going into the difference between dating and marriage relationships. Not so much the writing in laws, but the actual interaction between the two people. Dating seems like its a go to thing. You don't live with the person and to be together you have to \"go see\" eachother. Marriage like relationships are a go from thing. You spend all this time with a person and the only time you are away from the person is when you phisycally \"go from\" that person, such as work or go hang out with same sex night (girls/boys night). And I told him we have a dating relationship, we call eachother and have to go to eachother. But during the school year we have more of a marriage relationship, not married, but only in eyes of law. It's not fair to place so much emphasis on legal bindings when it really is only a religious thing that only some people can partake in. And then there are those that are married who are not really married, it's more like dating with the law on their side. And that is my analysis. Luckily Ross and I can adapt easily to both so this school, summer thing doesn't suck. It is a little more lonley but i figure it's only temprary. Personal: So roommate problems. It's only been a few weeks and they are pissing me off, well only the two actually. I don't care if they party or anything, but they are anti-social and rude all the time. So last night they have their sisters over and they are drinking late, and I was up, that was not the problem... The problem was that they were drinking and being loud, and drinking is prohibitted, but so if security comes we are fucked. And if we leave the shit out, we get in trouble, which guess what they never cleaned up. Turns out one went to the hospital, but well this is nothing new this not cleaning up. It's just very inconsiderate, but I have only one more week... so I don't care. I only hate feeling like shit the last week of summer classes. I got drugs and chilis so hopefully tomorrow won't suck as bad. It just stinks not being \"with it\" at work and class.

I would love to dream about the man I will marry and whom I love very much, but instead I still get haunted in my dreams of someone else. Second is sort of a continuing theme. The albino snake. But unlike last time this one looked like a cobra and in parts was almost translucent. Mom and I went for a job interview with John for a Basket Ball Coach job. John looked at the snake and accidentally let it escape. The owner (the man giving the interview) said it was fine and smiled. John was bit in the leg first and left Mom and I to go to the hostpital. Then I was bit in the legs three times, but I did not notice the third till I was at the hospital. My Mom noticed hers when I described that the snake bite did not hurt really, hers was on her toe. And then I woke up. Like the last one of the albino snake I could not fight it off or stop it and was bit. But this time each family memeber was bitten also and in the legs of all places.

By mornign it was making it's last cries for help, and I tried to help but it was to late, I had already sealed it's fate. Sad, but what does that say about life? Personal: Today was pretty shitty. It started pouring on my way back and the umbrella I had must have been to small, I was soaked from my knees down. Stupid slanty rian. And then Russ and I decided to cancell due to the crappy weather, so I went out and did errands instead! Also met up with Dave later on. We went to Montclair's Eclectic Cafe, I haven't been there in atleast a year. It was cool except for the annoying teens, waited a half hour to get seated and it was kareoke night, except these people were SOBER! One guy started singing to friggin System of a Down, I was like wow, thats pathetic and sad all at once. But I had really good coffee and gelato, and of course interesting catch up converstion with Dave. Haven't really seen him since he got home from Europe, and by haven't really seen I mean at all. Called Ross when I got back (and I wanted to go to bed early!). Trying to get plans together for this coming weekend. Supposed to go to the city tomorrow and then hoboken friday, maybe even shore saturday. But of course this is all weather permitting, it's no fun being drunk in the rain and then driving home a little buzzed.

Genji Monogatari is a story written by Murasaki Shikibu (a female servant of the royal court) in the early 11th century. It is one of the earliest novels in Japan and is sometimes said to be the oldest novel in the world! It tells the story of the a fictional character, named Hikaru Genji. He is a handsome son of the Japanese emperor, who is delegated to civilian life for political reasons and begins a career as an imperial officer. The tale concentrates in his romantic life and gives an impressive portrait of the customs of the time. Also, an important part of the book is waka (poetry) which is very hard to understand.

Before: I would slide my foot up as I was going up and flip it then land, scratching the toe cap to hell Now: I ollie up, as high as I want (better height than before) and then when I'm at or near my highest point I push down and flip it instead of sliding my foot off the edge and flipping it.

Then Kyle said he would wait all night, he didn't care, he didn't have anything better to do. \"BUT JUSTIN, WHAT WOULD YOU DO LOL?\". Well it turns out we loitered for 8-9 hours straight. We went to my house and tried my rail. We went to Kyle and got his.. 'stuff' and then we went to the mall and were assholes there for about 3 hours. Then stopped at the General Hospital and tried that big.. platform thing. I think that's where I busted my hip because it's really sore =(.

Not bad, it was nice. But it got so much more people when it was at the Civic Complex. I think the nicest tricks were the Hardflip Mute Grab over that kicker thing, and then the 360flip off the platform. There was some nice stuff though. Sam and Jessica showed up, that was cool. Then Ashley, Kibbee and Jess Sauve showed up. Ashley creeped me out with her naval ring. Bleh. It rained so we couldn't skate.. not like we had the strength.

They have it in 2 colorways, White/Gum and All Black.. yeah, I don't know. I'll probably just go out of town and buy a pair.

It's not overly hard work and the pay is good. I make $7 an hour. I pretty much make at LEAST $38 a day which isn't bad at all. I expect to have $350 by Sunday, the latest. Friday the earliest. I think I work Saturday and Sunday but I'm not too sure. A day off would be nice though. So then, when I have a free day, my mom said she'd bring me (and whoever I want to bring) to Ottawa.

First was Ashley had to kiss me. Alright. Then it was \"Justin do you still like Ashley\". I said \"sure. okay, yes I do\". Then I think Ashley got asked if she would go out with me, and that was a \"I don't know\". Phu was recording stuff too, but I'm not sure how that turned out. I was really tired that night. I just wanted to sleep. People kept touching me and I was getting wet from being against the tent. So then Ashley's grandmother gave us a ride home.

Good deal, for a camera that would be regular $800 (approx.). There's like hundreds of things I could do with a camera. And it would be completely mine, so I can do anything at all. Yesterday, I went out to meet Phu and Kyle in the other end of town. Well they were at Bishop to we were skating and then like 10 minutes later Kyle leaves. He wasn't going to come back out because of a phone call (wth?). So Phu and I hung out and then skated at Jean 21 and then went to his house after a little accident eek. So we talked Kyle into coming over, and then Quy and Nick came too. So we were skating at Blockbuster and crap and then the damn cop came and told us to leave. So we did, and we went back to Jean 21, this time with everyone. Then Kyle left, and the rest dropped like flies. So it was Phu and I again for like 90 minutes skating at 10pm, it was cool. Then we decided to leave and got these sweet planks and brought them to Phus house. Then I went home from there. End of story. Now on to today. I'm tired so I'm not going to write much.

Well we get there (My mom, Roger, myself, Phu and Jordon) and there were about 20 skaters outside so we knew we were at the right place. They were all gathered around so we went to see. It was about 4:30pm at this point. This guy was ollieing decks. He ollied 7 decks, stacked width wise. That is crazy. Then some guys said \" JUMP THE STEPS LOLZ\". So he went way back in the parkinglot for speed and came up, and after a few attempts, he ollied the 8 set. That was really nice too. 6:30 rolls around and still nothing. We're all thinking \"wth are they doing?\". So then we go to the parking lot on the side, and in the back, there was a crowd. So I said \"maybe there's a game of SKATE or something\". Yeah I was wrong. The Lakai team had pulled up into the parking lot (30 minutes late) and they got out and started warming up right there. It was sweet. Mike Carroll and Rick Howard were doing the most. They did it all so easily too. Then they left so we went back to the doors. Anyways, thanks to a problem, we didn't get in until 7:10pm. Go to www.lakai.com for details on that little delay, and www.crailtap.com for pictures. The demo was 2 hours 30 minites. Not bad. The skaters were awesome. There was Mike Carroll, Rick Howard, Jeff Lenoce, Anthony Pappalardo and Danny Garcia. They had a few other guys skating too, they were good. All in all, they kicked ass, it was awesome. They had a huge ass product toss. I got 20 stickers and 3 posters lol. Umm, autograph signings at the end. I got six. Four on my board and two on a poster. At least 100 kids showed up. Afterwards, we went to Wendy's (at 10:30) somewhere in downtown Ottawa and so the 3 of us, Phu, Jo and I skated around. It was cool. I'm supposed to go to Ottawa again sometime, just to skate around. I jumped a 3 set a few times, before the demo. That was fun. I got home at 11:45pm and then did whatever. (I might be buying a camcorder for cheap..hmm)\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Let's see..

My day: Ashley's mom called in the morning (11:15am) and asked if I needed a ride, I said \"no, it's okay\" even though I secretly could have used a ride. I talk to her mom on the phone more than I talk to Ashley these days. Tisk tisk. So I get there and the mall is closed. Already, my day is off to a craptacular start. So I go and I see Ashley's mom and evidently I was the first to arrive. So I stuck with her and we talked and everything. Then we see Kyle go and sit down and figured it'd be funny to wait and see how long until he spotted us. Kyle and I took off for drinks and stuff and Ashley's band thing finished so it was the 3 of us for a while, then we found Emma, Lee-Ann and Erika. We found Jess, Amy and Joel, and then went to an Ice Cream thing and stood around for a bit. Then Phu appeared magically, fashionably late (2:05pm) . So we had our gang and soon after Corey and Quy joind our posse. We were all at a picknic table. So Jess Ash go way off and sit in the grass and talk or something..('bout what?). Phu and I took.. Quy's board and went by the clock tower to skate. Then we all regroup and Ashley says \"we're leaving and we'll meet back here at 9:00\". Wow, alright then. So it was myself, Phu, Quy, Kyle and Corey. We went to Kyles, then Coreys, then back to the Clock Tower where Corey went home to play PS2 or something. Everyone was eating so I said \"I'll go home and eat, I'll be back in 60 minutes\" and Kyle says \"sure, we probably won't even move\". So I did my stuff and came back at about 6:05 and our insane posse had gotten much bigger. The Ashley kr3w came back 3 hours early and yea.. so we did whatever for the rest and then it was Amy, Jess, Emma (I think?)Lee-Ann, Erika, Ashley, Phu and myslef. Some other people got mixed in there, I was lost. So we went by the water and watched fire works. I must say, this year, they were great. The best in Cornwall for as long as I can remember. Ohhhh the moon was sweet ass too. It was red, I swear. It was so pretttyyyyy! The winner that night was the moon, until the clouds covered it and it went back to white. Today was awesome, I'm glad I went. w00t!! Ashleyyy your hair isn't as bad as I made it sound! After seeing it, it actually doesn't really bother me. Half the stuff I said was just teasing lol. But I stand by whatever I said about the naval. Blehhh. I forget what I said though. :p **THIS JUST IN** Freaky stuff going on here right now. I'm telling you, this is the wierdest/creepiest thing that has happened to me in a long time.--> I'm alone for the night, as usual, and I went to let the cat in at 3:00am. Well I open the door but no cat. As some of you know, we got this new living room set so our old couch and stuff is all on the veranda. I stood there for 5 minutes, completely shocked. Speachless, geeze. It's a girl, she looks to be 14-16, red tanktop and short white shorts. So I say \"what the hell? Why are you on my couch?\". No response. I was thinking she was ignoring me. So I look at her face and she was freakin' sleeping. WTF??! I'm thinking \"shit, there's a girl sleeping on my damn couch, wtf?\" So I say some things but she doesn't wake up. Now, I'm here alone, and it's hella cold to be wearing that skimpy stuff. She's fast asleep. She is right there on the couch as I'm typing this, I swear to you. 10% of me is sympathetic; maybe she has nowhere to stay, I'll let her stay for the night? 40% of me is dumbfounded, no clue what to do. What would you do if a teen was sleeping on your damn couch? No idea! 50% Is pissed off and creeped out. Cripes! How the hell? Honestly, who the hell goes onto to someone's porch and sleeps on their couch?! I should go slap her as hard as I can and say \"get the f*ck off my property or I'll kill you\".

BRAVO COY , BRAVO COY, BRAVO COY.. WE ARE THE BEST WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS.. WE ARE THE BEST IN 2SIR HOOOAHHH!!!. Heheheh Was sent to 2SIR on June 24th after passing out from SMM as a combat medic. Was deployed to Bravo Coy on 7 July 2003.. Lots of memories since then. Bravo Coy was the first to achieve operational ready status for the 11th mono 2SIR intake. Well I thought its kinda stupid to be posted 1 day before their first Alert red Manning which is on 8 July 2004. When I first got there the first person I met was Pte Adam or whom we call SATAN (coz his name tag is written as Si Ann Tan = SATAN) heheh. He is also kinda big size and got to know he also got posted in there mths back. He told me to expect hell in Bravo coz everyone is vying for gold standards. Well passing is just the dream for me. During the routine tournout preparation for the Alert Red manning I was introduced to my Platoon commander then was Lta Yazid, my platoon sergeant PS John, the different section commander and my fellow platoon mates heheh. Still remember the day when somebody call out for me from the officer\u2019s mess. This guy (who later I realize was my PC) talked to me but I am unsure who he is heheh Coz the first time he talk to me he was using helmet. J On the week itself I was given the welcome greetings by going for run and going for their PT. On that week itself I was kinda a bit pressurize by the future that awaits me\u2026 Damn.. Did many route marches ard camp and out of camp. My first major outfield with Bravo was during the time when we go for 14km route march with FBO to marsilling and stayed there to practice on our river crossing. Dat was really the first time when I really got to carry my FBO dat includes my stretcher and MOP for a really good distance. That was also the time when Bravo Coy really respect me for the weight I carried and for the endurance and perseverance I showed throughout the march. Well I was also shielded a lot by my PC from doing SOC and Ippt. Well he knows my problem.. I was really big then n still am now heheh. But I made my promise then to him that I put in effort to lose down my weight in return he allowed me not to take my IPPT. Well had lots of outfields after that. That is where I build up my endurance and learn more on how my company fight. Met lots of enemies from normal infantry men to the ADF of Spear coy. All this is to prepare us for our final exam which is ATEC in April 2004. We went for EX Buckspeed, an exercise to test our battalion capability. That was the first time I saw so much SAF vehicles and equipment heheh and there is where I learnt lots of \u201cterms\u201d which is usually used by my fellow platoon mates. That was one hell of an exercise. We walk and walk for donno how far.. Go against rain while pursuing our exercise with heavy equipment. I swear many many times for being in that condition but after 4 days of heat, rain, marches and etc we finally end our exercise. Every father mother son in that battalion was awarded with a Temasek badge to signify we are operational ready heheh. Although tired, I was really proud of myself for what I had achieved. My first SAF badge hehehe. After buckspeed we had many other difficult outfields to constantly prepare us for Brunei and ATEC later on heheh. After being awarded operational ready we are tasked with many many operational duites. One of it happen to be during the time we are having Alert Red. On that fateful day we really had a busy day. Just came back from range at ard 12am\u2026After finish cleaning our arms and washing up ourselves for the day I can swear that I don\u2019t even have the energy to open my eyes. Wore back only 1 side of my socks and suddenly my body just switch off.. EXACTLY 3 am in the morning, our batallion siren rang\u2026 OH SHIT WAT THE HECK IS GOIN ON!! I have not wore my shoes, have not kept my magazines in my SBO and many more.. Was rushing n rushing like mad dog hahaha.. Ran down and manage to be on time for the turnout\u2026 hahahh was panting and panting like mad.. Even when those senior staffs who came to check our stuffs, I was still panting heheh. Within 15 mins to the siren, many vehicles came into my battalion. Guess those are supply trucks carrying ammunition and other supplies hehehe. Wow this really really and well it is REAL!!! Hehehe Crazy shit and I am happy to be part of it. Well We were deployed in CMPB at 5am that same morning for OPS Basinet. :P After proving ourselves worthy defenders of Singapore we were entrust to do Ops duties in protecting key installations in Singapore. Well all this spreads into the schedule till December where we then flew off to Brunei for training. Our first overseas exercise. We were there exactly 2 weeks. Well really miss my family back then.. Heheh never left them for so long before. Well the route to our training site which is in Temburong was far and boring. Its basically trees and small villages dwelling ard. Went for my exercise NOMAD which is an exercise to condition us of the terrain in Temburong. Hahah guess wat it rain all through the exercise.. Got ourselves lost there too during that exercise. Ehhehe Got our pictures with a ghost, slept under ppl home, walk endlessly and pointlessly without knowing our route and climbing hill after hill with a wet and muddy terrain.. heheh. Crazy things to happen. Well the jungle there is so dark that u cant even see ur palm in front of u at nite. Its so dark\u2026 Like u are blind or something. Lots of funny memories there. After walking for 2 days ++ we finally found our way out when we accidentally came across the ZEBU trail.There is this famous insect there called the cicada which sounds like a cricket only much much louder.. heheh Went for Exercise Buaya the main exercise of our Brunei trip. It\u2019s a 4 day event. Happen to rain before the 1st day.. Well as predicted the ground is muddy and slippery. This was also my first time carrying my FBO for the exercise here. Walk n walk under the hot sun for the whole day. Guess the skies pee too much that it didn\u2019t have any left to give us for shade. Attacked our objective, slept for the nite then woke up flew off on a UH1H chopper to the foot of Mount Biang. Our objectives is to climb up Mt Biang, cross over the other side river cross at Batu Apoi. Walk through the 7 hills and attack our last objectives. Well my PS really help me a lot during this mission. Climbing up that damn mountain isn\u2019t hard.. Going down is\u2026 U can climb up within 4 hrs but going down takes a whole day\u2026 Halfway through the journey something bad happen.. One of the PC from Bravo fell and injured his leg\u2026 As the shout for MEDIC!!! I rushed down to see what happen.. As I ran down I myself got hurt.. Due to the slippery stones I end up injured myself.. Well dat doesn\u2019t matter coz others is more imp.. SO treated dat PC then try to evacuate him out from there.. Cant air lift him coz do not have any clearance\u2026 so wat to do have to evac him through the cold slippery river bank..It was one hell of a time there as each and everyone of us work hand in hand to help evac dat PC of ours\u2026 We we reach to the hill of Batu Apoi we then have to rushed before last light to cross over the river\u2026 We hurried and successfully cross over\u2026 By then I guess my leg just cant take it anymore\u2026 Didn\u2019t want to make another problem if halfway I cant walk anymore so I fall out after the crossing\u2026 Well Hafiz ( PC runner) also fell out coz of fever.. Dat nite was really freaky\u2026 My buddy Hafiz nearly died\u2026 Well saved him then but do not wish to talk abt it\u2026. Well after all the exercise was over n yes we were en route to home once again. Everyone was delighted when the flight crew says Welcome Home Boys!!! Hhehehe After coming back from Brunei we were quickly fill with a very busy schedule.. Lots of outfields, a number of Alert red manning, lots of Ippt and Soc training( something I dread a lot) and finally Intep( the exercise which is like a preliminary exam for us before Atec.. That was also the day where as much we walk.. we have to dig lots of shell scrapes tooo\u2026 Fuck up thanx to my brigade commander\u2026 Well finish that and we were on our final prep for Exercise Starlight(TAIWAN).. As we were about to go for our break before flying off, we were call upon for a real operation which is Ops Double Hammer\u2026 A manhunt in the heart on Pulau Tekong.. After few days they finally captured the 3 robbers which came in from Malaysia\u2026 Then we were off to Taiwan\u2026 Taiwan was really a very memorable experience for us.. We were there for about 5 wks ++ and going for two exercise.. Exercise High Noon (^brigade exercise) and ATEC.. We arriver during the turn of the season\u2026 Winter just ended but the cold winds from the costal water of Kaoshiong were still strong\u2026Doors in our bunk can just open and close on its own.. U can see how powerful those winds were.. It can be really cold in the morning.. Heheh wat can I say like our other exercises there are full of long distance marches, lots of cold nites, plenty of combat ration, many memories and 1 incident that nearly kill me heheh.. Well got overly exhausted and panting till my lungs nearly collapse.. Felt going to die when my wind pipe suddenly closed for a moment.. Could not breathe for a while but manage to pull myself together again\u2026 hehehe.. Well there is also lots of Ninja Van which followed us through our exercise.. They are just selling foods from vans.. Generally we are not allowed to purchase to prevent us from getting sick for no reason, but then once in a while we did buy. Its like a bonus..J My favourite hill call Shi Ma Li San that I dream off even before we go for our ATEC.. Well miss my family and my baby lots when I was in Taiwan.. Well manage to get in reach with them through my Hp(bills which still clearing off now) and the internet that is available in Heng Choon camp. RNR was superb.. Went to many places of interest in Kaoshiong which includes Kenting(a sea side surfer nite market) and their theme park.. Crazy roller coaster rides and lots of pictures just make it a well remembered trip.. Heheheh Got back from Taiwan did our last Alert Red and had generally been slacking since then\u2026 We were given a chance to fly on a Chinhook and also SAF Super Puma choppers.. Travelled in assault boats and also Lark 5 for our coastal hook training J SO many things but well as much as u r tired reading this I m getting tired too writing it hahaha.. Well cut things short I continue to slack a lot in Bravo.. Played games both physical and board games in camp.. Catch lots on sleeping and clearing offs hehehe Wow all this in 1 yr..

Well didn\u2019t really had much time posting any blog msgs coz kinda busy.. Hahhah. Today got time so y not rite. So far it have been one pressurizing week for me. Well got back for work from my off\u2019s on Wednesday. Finally finished unpacking all my stuffs in my new bunk. Kinda feeling really fuck up with my new bed heheh.. Generally the springs are mostly gone. So everytime when I sleep on the bed my mattress will seem to get sucked in. Imagine a water bed replace it with normal sponge. Been trying to get along with the new guys a bit better. Well before joining my battalion HQ things can be very quiet between me and the new medics. Finish planning the duty forecast for August. Few points seems to worry me these few days. Firstly the new guys seems to have some attitude problems. They tend to take things on their own hands and tend to piss me off by that. Well they piss me off on Thursday by sleeping in the bunk after lunch break. They also tend to slack around. Well I am in a dilemma whether to be strict or to play along with them n hoping things will change later in the future.. Well its something I am quite stress about. Next is because Shahrul got a letter from CMPB stating that he have to be transfer to a new vocation. He will no longer be a medic coz of his PES status. He kinda feeling low till Friday when he heard the news dat he had to change vocation but do not need to be transfer out from the medical center.. Somethin that everyone wishes for heeheh. Lastly still trying to get the hang of being a 2IC. So much things to know heheh. Well IQA is also around the corner. So have to werk doubly hard to get a gd record for our IQA. Well my dispensary department is about 90% prepared for it but the rest of the departments still in shaky gounr. Cant blame them they are still new.. This is like the first for most of them heheh. Well hope everything turn out fine later. Hehehe I went back to my Bravo bunk last Thursday.. Kinda miss that place a lot.. Although its only about 1 week since I left the place but I guess my heart is still there.. That used to be my place of joy and sorrow. My favourite bed heheh which is far much comfortable than even my bed at home hahha. Well I sat there for about half an hour admiring and thinking about the fond memories heheh.. Going to miss it a lot but well sooner or later things have to go on J Okie dokie have to go to bed now got my SPEC 2 course briefing in SMM tomorrow heheh chiao!!\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Ahhh yess heheheh finish painting my room at last..

I had always been wanting to further my studies but its usually money problems hold me back.. I cant depend on my parents coz i guess my two other siblings will be going for tertiary studies in years to come..Damn those lucky rich blokes n bitches... Sometime u can just see all these ppl they can just waste their time not studying coz they know at the end of the day they know their parents can support them or even sent them to another skool just coz they got lots of money... While as for us who are always motivated to study to persue our dreams always fall short coz of lack of Money..Well at times i wonder where is the fairness in this... Well i wonder how my future will turn out to be.. really want to study...Y CANT I STUDY WHEN I STILL WANT TO...Y ISSIT HARD FOR ME TO PERSUE MY DREAMS...Money makes ppl kill,cheat,rob,hynotised,break the relationship and lots more i wonder seriously y at the first place MONEYwas created...

Was playing playstation last nite then just suddenly dropped dead asleep hehe.dats somethin i got problem with. when i feel really tired my body just switch off from anythin dat i do n just sleep heheh. Anwyay yesterday had a bad afternoon. Went to Nee Soon again for another medic training. it was raining really heavily yesterday. when i reach there just sat n wait for not even 5 mins then the event instructor cancelled the training due to wet weather. but then the shit part is its like 45 mins to the start of the lesson.. By 1230 the rain subside... then i was thingkin if she would have just wait till now which is 15 mins from original planned start time, the trip to nee sonn would not be wasted... Damn!!! Piss me off seh.. This is the third time in less than a week thant this happens.. Shit!!! The nxt shit thing is the vehicle we indent to pick us back to camp never really came... The driver n his vehicle went AWOL i tink... fuck him... Then as stupid as it may seems we took a cab back to camp....(which is to say $$ is not refundable) Came back to medical centre... called my snr medic to inform him of my duty this sat... How the heck would i be in 2 places at 1 time. i m having duty this sat n at the same time i have to report at kranji camp at 2pm for another medic training... Simply fuck up!!! I still wonder if sat they will screw things up again... My senior medic told me to just switch ard my duties.. I tell myself when would i able to do my weekend duty... if i were to switch it to this sunday then i would not be coming back for 2 weeks then.. If i were to push it the following week then i be doing it rite after i finish my Ex. Mousedeer... I cant it push to the 24 of july coz i m having some family function on dat day... Wat the fuck... this really piss me off.. If he regard me to be 1 of the best medic in 2SIR then he should give me a bit of respect n leeway... If he were to attached me to so much training to make our unit look gd then he should provide me with a better schedule with my duties... dats the least i m asking for... I m sick n tired of helping ppl who in the end doesnt seems to appreciate the work done.. He had forgotten that BRAVO coy is the real backbone of his medical centre.. Without us always helping them do all last minute stuffs then he will always be in deep shit.. Dont let it come to a stage where i shall boycott him n the medical centre.. Alpha is not always there... Charlie onli a few would support.. N if we dont support then he go eat his own shit... But well dats wat happen in the day though. I met my baby in the evening.. Went for dinner at Harbour Front.. Just love the mee soto there.. but reach there i tink it might just not be filling enough to eat just the mee soto.. So i ordered mee goreng n mutton soup instead.. which is to say 1 of the best soup in singapore.. After dinner we went down to orchard. hang ard there do some window shopping n then flatter with more fds at Taka food fest. heheh bought lots of fd last nite heheh.

So as a result, we are prone to argument. Like when I say I am fine but she knows I am not being honest. Or when I don't accept her trying to take care of me. I am totally at fault.

It seemed really realistic, and very plausible. We like to think that we will never see the consequences of our actions, that is why it is easy to say \"it might happen in the next one hundred to one thousand years.\" I honestly believe that these things are very possible, and they will occur when we least expect it, in a way that we can't imagine. This movie really convinced me that we need to protect the environment, and that we can do something about it. It is easy to think that we personally can't help, or don't effect anything. If all six billion of us individuals thought that way, we would have a serious problem. But on the other hand if we all work together, we can make a serious difference. Living away from my mother country gives me a viewpoint on things that I would have otherwise not had. Here in Japan, we recycle all of our garbage. And now, as I look at America, which doesn't have a very developed recycling program, and does not try to comply with the rest of the worlds environmental standards, I feel really disappointed. America is a big and powerful nation. We should be the one leading other countries, not straggler or rebel. I think that it's easy to have the \"out of sight, out of mind\" attitude. Especially America, being a large country. Smaller countries or island countries are somewhat forced to be more conscious about the environment because the result of their actions are very much in full view. As for CO2 emitions, well, we have to look south to see our consequences. At any rate, we are all being nurtured and sheltered by our common home, the Earth, which is why not one of us can think we don't have a responsibility, or that we can't make a difference. Inspirations from the Movie What is more important? What we leave behind, or how we lived our lives. As I was thinking about the movie, I thought about all the people that were involved. There was a part where they had to burn books to stay alive. This made me think about lots of things. Yeah our lives are very important, and those books aren't- materialisticly speaking. so i started to think about what was more important in our lives. The things that we have or the things that we do or the things that we leave behind. recently, I saw troy and Achilles really wanted his name to go down in history and live throughout the ages, because he knew that in the long run his life really meant nothing. I would just expire and nothing would be left. One of my favorite urlLink Star Trek Captains, Jean Luc Picard, said \"The things we leave behind are not as important as how we've lived.\" (Star Trek Generations.) I think that he is right. As long as we live a moral and right life, one that is just and true, then it doesn't matter what if our name is forgotten or that nothing from us is left behind. urlLink The Day After Tomorrow\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Lately me and my wife have been doing the internet auction= Yahoo Japan, and she wants to start her own web journal= Rakuten Ichiba.

Since I got with her, I have had to choose my words very wisely because some things I say in jest, she takes seriously. She believes if you say a thing- especially a bad thing- you really mean it. That isn't true with me. I don't believe that. And if that holds true, then all the terrible things she has said to me and said that she didn't mean, she ment. So lets get to the point. She was cutting vegtables, and she always asks me to help, especially the way she was cutting them- long and thin. So I offered to do it. And she responded with a cute \"why?\" and that thought process that I spoke of starts up, I weighed the outcomes, and I stupidly chose to joke with her.

So when Life published a special issue focusing on 21 breakthroughs in medical science for the 21st century, we knew we had to review these with a focus on how they would affect religious faith. All of these are now in existence under clinical trials which could be complete around the middle of the next century. 1. Memory drugs. Scientists have discovered a method for manipulating the gene responsible in part for long-term memory. They\u2019ve been able to give fruit flies a photographic memory, and are hard at work on a drug for humans based on this discovery. 2. Attacking schizophrenia. E. Fuller Torrey has developed a \u2018brain bank\u2019 of more than 100 brains from schizophrenic and manic-depressives. Samples are being studied by groups around the world searching for the cause of the schizophrenia. Some are hunting for genetic clues, others for traces of a virus or a faulty neurotransmitter. 3. Edible vaccines. Researchers have developed a method for infusing potatoes with a vaccination for traveler\u2019s diarrhea. The potatoes become living, low-cost vaccine factories, but because they contain no virulent agents they can\u2019t cause an infection. This could become a low-cost way of delivering vaccines to the Third World. 4. Treating age-related blindness. Researchers have developed a new method for treating severe age-related macular degeneration (blindness in old age) by a two-step process involving a light-sensitive drug and very cool laser beams. This process is less dangerous than the previous one using \u2018hot\u2019 laser beams. 5. Blocking angiogenesis. Tumors are fueled by their ability to spark the construction of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). A new antiangiogenetic therapy halts this process, causing tumors to practically melt away. In a few years this could represent a cure for cancer, but it has further applications with more than 75 other diseases, including coronary artery disease, strokes, and AIDS. 6. The Smart Shirt. Scientists have developed a smart T-shirt with embedded sensors (like electrocardiograms to monitor the heart) which can transmit their signals to a satellite and thence to any location on Earth. These are useful for monitoring at home patients, police officers, athletes, or soldiers on a battlefield. 7. Herceptin therapy. Traditional cancer therapy is to throw as much poison into the body and hope it doesn\u2019t kill good cells as well as bad ones. Herceptin is a \u2018smart bomb\u2019: it directly attacks the message system used to tell cancer cells to replicate wildly, and has few side effects. It\u2019s been successful with some breast cancers. 8. Artificial retina. An implantable computer chip translates image information from a camera mounted on an eyeglass frame into electrical impulses which it passes through the retina to the brain. Early test patients have been able to detect motion and shapes. Others are working on a hybrid electronic-biological artificial retina. 9. Gene therapy. Scientists are using \u2018suicide genes\u2019 to attack glioblastoma, a fatal brain tumor. A modified leukemia virus (able to enter human cells but not cause the disease) carries a herpes simplex virus which produces cold sores. These infect the tumor, and are then killed using an antiviral drug. Since the virus infects only dividing cells, normal healthy brain cells aren\u2019t affected. Genetic therapies are in development for more than 200 individual diseases, and are anticipated to be worth $3.5 billion in sales by 2005. 10. Eradicate polio. A global campaign led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, Rotary International and the USCDC could eradicate polio in the next 4 years. The next target will be measles, which despite an effective vaccine kills 1 million annually. 11. Designer hormones. Tamoxifen was originally developed as a contraceptive, but failed (it actually almost guaranteed a woman would become pregnant). It\u2019s estrogen-binding properties, however, have enabled scientists to revive it as a drug to ward off breast cancer. Other \u2018designer hormones\u2019 could prove useful against Alzheimer\u2019s and hearing loss. 12. AIDS vaccine. There are seven different vaccines in process (AIDSVAX is the most advanced). The AIDS epidemic is taking a terrible toll on Africa and Asia, and the UN anticipates a large population decrease in those areas. More than 21 million Africans and 4 million Indians are infected\u2014unless a cure is found, some whole countries could simply cease to exist. 13. Stem cells. One of the most controversial researches involves fetal brain stem cells, which can be used to grow virtually any organ or tissue without the problems of rejection. A US ban on fetal research limited the availability of cells for study; but a recent experiment has led to the ability to multiply fetal brain stem cells in a laboratory, leading to a potentially endless supply and avoiding the ethical problem that led to the ban. 14. Cancer vaccines. A new process is underway to develop vaccines that teach the body to cure its own cancers. New research is making it possible to develop more accurate vaccines. In some trials, patients have showed tumor regression of more than 50%. 15. Holograms. A computer can now be used to generate three-dimensional pictures of the brain: useful for precise measurement of tumors and anatomic relationships: important when neurosurgery cases can fail over a difference as small as a millimeter. 16. Aging. Researchers have discovered more than 20 genes implicated in longevity. They anticipate tremendous strides in the biochemistry of aging in the next five years, and a thorough understanding by the middle of the next century. 17. Stress management. The National Institutes of Health is funding a $30 million research study into stress management after finding that depression and isolation can kill cardiac patients and that stress-reduction techniques can lower blood pressure and heart rate. 18. Genetic screening. Some day you may be given a genetic ID card which knows everything about you\u2014including what diseases you are susceptible to. This could eliminate privacy but could be useful in discovering and stopping genetic diseases: a miniscule blood sample could reveal the presence of a tumor in time to treat it. 19. Asthma drugs. New drugs are being designed to cure the faulty immune system of asthmatics. Applications for FDA approval are expected by AD 2000. Asthma afflicts as many as 15 million Americans\u2014one third of them children. 20. Artificial heart. Surgical teams at US hospitals are preparing for a new trial: replacing failing hearts with battery-powered mechanical pumps made of plastic and titanium. (The first candidates are cows, but doctors hope to be conducting human trials by 2000). 21. Spinal cord repair. New drugs may soon win FDA approval and be used as the first treatment for spinal cord injury. These medicines are useful only in the regenerative phase of recovery, but will lead to new advances in getting the spinal cord to repair itself. Most of these advances will be welcomed by religious faiths. Two lines of debate will likely open. The first, of course, is \u2018who gets to take advantage of them?\u2019 An artificial heart, for example, can cost about $125,000. Many of these will be beyond the reach of the average American, let alone someone in the Third World. Some, of course, won\u2019t be critical\u2014people in the Third World tend to take old-age blindness and heart failure with a grain of salt. But others\u2014like vaccinations for AIDS or polio\u2014are crucial. That\u2019s why advances like potatoe-delivered vaccines are important. They lessen the cost of the overall treatment. Other advances will be fraught with controversy. Many religious extremists will see sinister monitoring conspiracies in the \u2018Smart Shirt,\u2019 for example. Some will be opposed to technological implants like artificial hearts and eyes. And debates over the use of fetal stem cells and antiaging drugs will be vicious indeed. Religion has an important place in these matters, though. Religious leaders can lend to the medical debate the argument of ethics; further, they must speak to the spiritual implications of these discoveries. For example, if mankind were to live on average to 150 years, what would it mean for our development as a civilization? ___________________________ The discoveries listed were essayed in Life, October 1998.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "The current church growth rate coupled with the rate of growth in discipleship and teaching centers suggests China will become a majority Christian nation\u2014eventually. As Christianity takes in a greater percentage of the population, the government will certainly lighten its restrictions. In fact, we may very well see officers in the government who are publicly Christians (right now, many of the Communist Party are secret believers). However, it's not likely that total religious freedom will be available before 2025\u2014perhaps not before 2050. It\u2019s doubtful that the majority of China\u2019s residents will be Christians any time in the next century. The likeliest obstacle holding up church growth isn\u2019t government repression\u2014it\u2019s materialism. Economic growth is the principle goal of the country, and its achievement has already begun to have an impact on the church. Several Christian workers who labor on behalf of the Chinese church have reported cases of ecclesiastical crime and apathy toward the church due to greater interest in material gains. As economic gains filter down to more and more of China\u2019s people, it\u2019s probable that materialism will dampen church growth, just as it has in the West. Christian activists need to begin working on discipleship and training programs that teach Chinese believers the proper role of money in their life, and how not to make an idol of it. This could be one of the greatest contributions Christians make to the culture of the world over the next century.

The result: in 2000, 235 million people said they were Christians but only 191 million were part of a church.

Now, terrorism against religious groups has entered the electronic world. \u2018Two unidentified women set up Internet accounts that were used in a three-day automated attack [in early September] on religious Usenet newsgroups. The attackers used familiar newsgroup member names in sending thousands of off-subject, often vulgar, posts to a number of alt.religion groups on the Internet.\u2019 (Wired News, 18 September 1998). Many of the messages came with forged identities purporting to be from regular posters to the group. Reviewing the alt.religion.christianity newsgroup at the time, one could see several messages with the headers, \u2018Stop using my name!\u2019 With more than 10,000 forged messages flooding the group, the problem eventually became so rampant that posters began digitally \u2018signing\u2019 their messages using encryption software in order to verify their identity. A similar sort of cyberterrorism was exemplified by an attack on the web site edition of the New York Times, when hackers replaced the front page of the Times with a hacked version. Security experts suggest a more subtle hack\u2014the alteration of a few smaller pieces of less-public pages on the Times\u2019 web site\u2014would have been virtually undetectable and could have done a significant amount of damage. This illustrates just how deadly electronic forgeries can be. Messages supposedly from Bill Gates abound on the Internet, promising free vacations if people pass the message on so an e-mail tracking program can be tested. Most people know these messages to be fakes, and would probably be suspicious of an e-mail message supposedly from Billy Graham or the Pope. On the other hand, an e-mail message forged from a local pastor carrying a solicitation for drugs or pornography could do horrific damage to one\u2019s reputation. In fact, by 2004, an updated version of this kind of attack became widespread. New computer viruses were forging the \"From\" addresses, making themselves appear to be messages from authentic religious websites (as well as many other large websites). Today, the only ones to be immediately affected by this would be individuals in the West, where such technology is most prevalent. However, as the technology becomes more useful in northern Africa and Asia, elements hostile to Christianity may very well adapt such a technique in order to drum up false charges against Christian leaders or to sully their reputation. Religious conferences being held in the East were beginning to feel the problem this year. How to avoid such a future? Individuals regularly corresponding by e-mail could begin \u2018signing\u2019 their name using electronic signatures such as those offered by PGP Encryption or through Microsoft Outlook. News sites can similarly use digital \u2018wrappers\u2019 to sign and secure their web stories. The only other real route is to maintain a life of integrity and to quickly respond to any forgeries with evidence\u2014which is exactly what participants in the alt.religion.christianity forum did.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "http://www.churchcentral.com/nw/s/template/Article.html/id/19253 has an article about youth churches: \"According to the New York Times News Service this new 'alt-evangelism' attracts a young generation seeking an authentic, intimate and personal religious experience, different from their 'media-intensified lives.'\".

GETTING THE EDGE July 19, 2004 Edge took a page out of the Evolution playbook Monday night, beating Randy Orton for the second straight time with a nifty backslide and a little leverage from the ring ropes. The Legend Killer hoped to reduce the five-time Intercontinental Champion to another T-shirt statistic, and he seemed a three-count away after a low blow and an RKO. But a groggy referee was slow to make the count, and Edge mustered enough energy to barely kick out. When Orton went to his finisher again, Edge reversed it into a winning \u2014 and slightly illegal \u2014 pinning predicament. While the fans in Washington were treated to a highly competitive Intercontinental Championship defense, those live in Pittsburgh next week will witness the biggest RAW contest of the year. In a 60-minute Iron Man Match that begins promptly at the top of the hour, Chris Benoit will defend the World Heavyweight Championship against Triple H. Whoever scores the most decisions in the allotted time will walk out with the title. But one question remains: Can the Crippler even walk after the vicious beating taken at the hands (and feet) of Batista? Early in Monday\u2019s Benoit-Batista bout, it was clear that the Evolution member was taking his cues from The Cerebral Assassin. Rather than even attempt a cover, Batista simply continued to assault Benoit with illegal chokes and skull-crushing kicks. Batista repeatedly defied the referee\u2019s orders while Benoit was tangled in the ring ropes, eventually leaving the official no choice but to call for a disqualification. The attack continued after the bell, punctuated by a ring-jarring Batista Bomb. Unable to walk under his own power, Benoit had to be helped from ringside. It was just what The Game ordered only seven days before a championship match of epic length. The animal Batista also made his presence felt during a match between Kane and Chris Jericho \u2014 leveling Y2J with an all-too-familiar whirlwind clothesline. Capitalizing while deep in the D.C. crowd, Kane covered Jericho for the \u201cFalls Count Anywhere\u201d victory. Jericho appeared to have earned a count-out victory early on, but a resentful RAW General Manager had different ideas. Eric Bischoff wasn\u2019t the least bit amused after a Jericho prank led to the Diva hopefuls trashing Bischoff\u2019s office. So, he seized the opportunity to get back at Y2J by ordering the match vs. Kane to continue with the unusual match stipulation. After watching the 10 Diva Search finalists strut their stuff and tear apart Bischoff\u2019s office, which one gets your heart rate revved up?

General Manager Kurt Angle. Angle, who earlier in the evening said he\u2019d likely be wheelchair-bound for life, made a shocking and all-too-physical appearance during the match between former champion Eddie Guerrero and JBL. As the masked El Gran Luchadore, Angle scaled the 15-foot-high cage, grabbing Guerrero and holding him long enough for JBL to escape for the victory. Eddie succeeded in unmasking Angle before he could make his getaway, revealing Angle to be a fraud and trickster with an unnecessary leg cast and wheelchair. Angle promised that this would be \u201ca night no one will ever forget.\u201d But at the time he seemed to be referring to his plans for John Cena \u2014 not the night\u2019s main event in which the WWE Championship was decided in a Steel Cage Match for the first-ever time on SmackDown! Before donning the garb and mask of a Mexican champion, Angle made a big-time match for next week: John Cena vs. an infuriated Luther Reigns. Angle also placed Cena in another unfair situation \u2014 an Elimination Handicap Match against Rene Dupree, Booker T and Kenzo Suzuki. Cena managed to eliminate two of his opponents, but Booker T finished him off after getting a little help from Luther Reigns. With the big win, is Booker T first in line for the vacant United States Championship? Earlier, Spike Dudley got some unsolicited help from the Dudleys during a tag-team match. The Dudleys seemed quite pleased until D-Von lost to Paul London one-on-one. With the rollup victory, London stated his case that winning the WWE Tag Team Championship with Billy Kidman wasn\u2019t a fluke, after all. Lastly, John Heidenreich revealed that he\u2019s now aligned with the dastardly Paul Heyman. Only time will tell what influence Heyman will have on the young WWE Superstar.

When Eugene learned he\u2019d be in Monday night\u2019s main event, little did he know it was simply part of The Game\u2019s vicious plan. And neither competitor expected to end the night bloodied and incapacitated at the hands of a third party. The match began beautifully for the challenger. He avoided Benoit\u2019s patented diving headbutt, later mimicking his opponent with German suplexes and even the Crippler Crossface. The Rabid Wolverine was clearly willing to do whatever it took to retain, ripping into Eugene with quick, stinging moves. But Eugene again caught Benoit using other Superstars\u2019 attack arsenal, hitting a Rock Bottom that came dangerously close to being the end. Benoit managed to get a foot on the bottom rope, but Eugene thought he won and went to claim his World title. With the match still technically in progress, Evolution descended upon the ring. It was perfect timing for Triple H and Company, as Benoit was down and Eugene was celebrating. Soon, the contest disintegrated into a barbaric beat-down. When Evolution had their fill with Benoit, they turned their full attention to tearing apart Eugene. Randy Orton hit an RKO. That was followed by a Batista Bomb. And worst of all, Eugene\u2019s \u201cfavorite wrestler\u201d blasted him with a Pedigree and left him an unconscious mass of crimson. Besides taking his turn beating up Eugene, Ric Flair also found time to school The Hurricane. Flair weathered an early storm from his young opponent, who even managed to draw first blood. But that seemed to incite the \u201cNature Boy,\u201d who took over in signature fashion. He isolated The Hurricane\u2019s leg, setting up a Figure Four Leg Lock from which there was no escape. Fellow Evolution member Batista had no such luck against the new Intercontinental Champion Edge. The animal dropped everything but the kitchen sink on the five-time Intercontinental Champion, but Edge\u2019s resourcefulness saw him through. When Batista went for his high-impact spinebuster, Edge rolled him up and grabbed the top rope for leverage. The illegal advantage went undetected by the referee, and Batista lost in what could be considered poetic justice after Batista\u2019s controversial Vengeance win over Chris Jericho. The Lita-Kane-Matt Hardy saga spilled over into Jericho\u2019s Highlight Reel on Monday night. In the end, Lita told off Kane and Y2J infuriated the monster into an impromptu match. Kane clearly was more interested in taking out his frustration than winning, opting for a DQ-causing low blow \u2014 just because he could. Lita wasn\u2019t the only pretty face on Monday Night RAW. Trish Stratus watched as Tyson Tomko beat Maven, and three Diva hopefuls were interviewed by a very pleased Jerry \u201cThe King\u201d Lawler.

HHH gave Benoit another suplex but Benoit fought back with chops but Triple H whipped him to the ropes and knocked him down with a reverse elbow for two. Triple H delivered a backbreaker to Benoit and then sent Benoit to the outside with a drop toe hold. HHH followed him out and rammed the back of Benoit into the edge of the ring and sent him back inside. Benoit battled back with chops but Triple H whipped Benoit to the corner and charged but was met with feet to the face and then was given a series of chops and then a snap suplex. Benoit charged at Triple H in the corner but was met with a reverse elbow. Benoit regained control with a German Suplex and then took HHH down by the legs and capapulted him to the corner and then clotheslined him to the outside of the ring. Benoit went outside and was given a thumb to the eye but Benoit then whipped HHH into the steel steps. Benoit threw HHH back inside and then went to the top rope and went for the diving headbutt but Triple H rolled out of the way. Both men are down on the mat and we are shown a reply of Benoit's head bouncing off the canvas. Benoit went to work on HHH with chops but Triple H sent him sturnum first into the buckle with high velocity. Triple H sent Benoit sturnum first into the other buckle, and Benoit looks to be in severe pain and the impact on that move was unbelieveable. Triple H kicked Benoit in the sturnum and then dropped his knee onto the sturnum of Chris Benoit and this is why he is called the cerebral assassin. Triple H looked to go for a vertical suplex but then threw him off and sent Benoit falling down onto his sturnum and HHH made the cover for two. Triple H stomped on the chest of Benoit on the mat and then again gave Benoit a reverse suplex, sending Benoit sturnum first into the mat for two. Triple H then shoved his knee into the back of Benoit, separating his chest and wrenching back on the arms of Benoit, and Benoit is bleeding from the mouth from the missed headbutt earlier on. Benoit began to fight back but Triple H sent him to the outside of the ring. Triple H sent Benoit chest first into the security wall and then sent Benoit back inside. Triple H again whipped Benoit sturnum first into the buckle for two. Benoit tried to fight back with chops but Benoit locked in an abdominal strecth, which will punish the torso of Benoit, especially with the injured chest of Benoit. The fans got behind Benoit and he escaped the hold and reversed it into one of his own but HHH quickly hip locked out of the predicament. Triple H locked in a sleeper hold on Benoit as Benoit tried to make it to the ropes, but Triple H pulled him back inside. Benoit escaped and locked in a sleeper of his own and then tried to lock in the Sharpshooter, but Triple H kicked him away and went for the Pedigree, but benoit took him down and locked in the Sharpshooter in the middle of the ring! Triple H writhed in pain but clawed his way to the ropes, but Benoit dragged him back to the middle of the ring until Triple H finally made it to the ropes. Benoit hit the German Suplex on HHH twice and then held on and hit the third. Benoit singalled for the end and went up top but Triple H rolled to the outside of the ring and Benoit jumped through the middle ropes with a suicide dive onto the Game sending both of them into the barricade. The referee got knocked to the outside and then HHH hit a DDT on Benoit and then shouted for Eugene and signalled for him to come out! Eugene made his way down the aisle looking nervous, as Triple H pointed at the referee. Benoit then locked in the Crossface on Triple H as Eugene looked on from outside and Benoit was yelling at him to get the referee and Eugene didn't know what to do! Triple H began tapping out but the referee was still down as Eugene made his way up the steps and went to get in the ring and Benoit nailed him, and he can't take any chances in this match. Eugene looked upset as Benoit looked on, and then Triple H scored with a low blow and then hit the Pedigree on Benoit and told Eugene to get the referee, which he did. Eugene shoved the referee back into the ring and Benoit kicked out at the last possible moment! Triple H told Eugene to get him a chair, and Eugene handed it to the Game. TripleH went to hit Benoit, but Eugene grabbed the chair, and then Triple H pie faced him off the apron. Benoit then kicked the chair right into the face of the Game and picked up the chair and Triple H was begging off. Ric Flair came down and was hit with the chair, as was Batista. Eugene got into the ring and told Benoit not to use the chair. Triple H then kicked Benoit in the lower extremities and picked up the chair, but Benoit gave him the low blow! Eugene got into the ring and picked up the aprin and was going to hit Benoit but he changed his mind and then went to hit Triple H and changed his mind and went back to Benoit and then Triple H again and then Benoit tried to grab the chair for him but Eugene would not let go. Triple H got up and Benoit let go of the chair and Euegen hit Triple H in the head with the chair by mistake! Both men got to their feet and then Benoit rolled up Triple H to retain the World Heavyweight Championship!! Winner, and still World Heavyweight Champion, Chris Benoit Benoit made his way to the back with the title and Eugene looked very upset on the outside at what he did to Triple H. Triple H came to his senses and was holding his head in pain and Benoit stood proud as the World Heavyweight Champion! Triple H then turned his attentions to Eugene and gave him an evil glare and Eugene was saying sorry, and he was near to tears. Triple H shouted abuse at Eugene as Vengeance went off the air!\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "More in a few hours.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "COLD NIGHT IN CANADA July 8, 2004 Winnipeg, Manitoba, was a tough place to be a title holder on Thursday night. WWE Champion JBL was deceived, United States Champion John Cena was stripped and the 18-time tag champs fell to a couple of crisp, counterattacking cruiserweights. After months of trying to wrestle the United States Championship away from Cena through a steady diet of difficult matches, General Manager Kurt Angle finally succeeded \u2014 by taking an out-of-the-ring shortcut. Angle vacated the belt after Cena defied previous warnings and put his hands on the SmackDown! GM. But it might be worthy to note that at the time, Cena was battling his scheduled opponent, Booker T, as well as enforcer Luther Reigns, a cane-wielding Angle and fiery Kenzo Suzuki. A Reigns sneak-attack and powerslam left Cena writhing in the ring; Angle\u2019s proclamation added insult to injury. After nearly losing the WWE Tag Team titles on Velocity, The Dudleys were wary of the courageous tandem of Paul London and Billy Kidman. They isolated London in classic Dudley fashion, using their superior size to grind down the challenger. But both London and Kidman proved far more resilient than expected, eventually turning the tables on D-Von and Bubba Ray. With a WAZZUP! headbutt of their own, the challengers began building momentum. When a London crescent kick set up Kidman\u2019s patented Shooting Star Press, we suddenly had an upset special. The new WWE Tag Team Champions were met with a hero\u2019s welcome backstage, and surprisingly, they even received a congratulatory handshake from the beaten Dudleys. WWE Champion JBL hand-picked another opponent Thursday, seemingly ensuring a smooth path to next week\u2019s Steel Cage Match with Eddie Guerrero. Promising a \u201cchampion vs. champion\u201d competition, JBL brought out a Mexican title holder, El Gran Luchadore. Just as planned, JBL dominated with power moves. But when he tossed El Gran Luchadore to the outside, things quickly got interesting. The masked Mexican Superstar switched with an near-identical wrestler under the ring \u2014 one who could hold his own with the WWE Champion. Suddenly, JBL had his hands full with his opponent. And before he could fully sort out the circumstances, El Gran began to strut just like Latino Heat! After finding himself on the wrong end of the \u201cThree Amigos\u201d suplexes, JBL knew something was amiss and made for the entrance ramp. The familiar-sounding second Luchadore reminded JBL that next week, there will be no running from the Steel Cage. Match Results: Rob Van Dam defeats Mark Jindrak Paul London and Billy Kidman def.

Here's a review I prepared while viewing the matches: Bad Blood June 13th 2004 Nationwide Arena, Columbus, OH Bad Blood was spilt all over when two rivals busted each other in a Hell In A Cell and a champion himself had to become a monster to surpass the monster. The 1st match was for the World Tag Team Championship Champions La R\u00e9sistance vs. Chris Benoit and Edge This was a rematch granted by Eric Bischoff on the last episode of RAW, but you would see (even the announcers mentioned it) Edge fighting and being more involved in the match more than Benoit. Whether that was to rest himself before facing Kane later that evening remains to be seen. La Rez proved that they could defend their new World Tag Team titles against the team they defeated to win them, but the challengers almost turned the tables as Benoit locked the Crippler Crossface on Sylvain Grenier and Edge speared Rob Conway to throw him out of the ring. Unbelievably, La R\u00e9sistance kept their titles, but by disqualification, when Kane crashed the scene and attacked and chokeslammed Benoit and Edge. Singles Match Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko w/ Trish Stratus This was a typical 'David vs. Goliath' situation. Speed against power. Tomko is a physically dominating athlete, and this match showed how powerful he was as he threw Y2J from one side of the ring to the other. The tables turned when Tomko accidentally knocked Trish off the ring apron and Jericho, seeing the opportunity, did a sort of dropkick / drop toe hold mix to get the 1-2-3. Intercontinental Championship Champion Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin Shelton completely dominated the match and blew Orton away. Everything that Randy could do, Shelton could do it better. The only reason he won was because of Ric Flair's dirty tactics and a handful of tights. Next time he won't be so lucky. Women's Championship Champion Victoria vs. Gail Kim vs. Lita vs. Trish Stratus This one was a very quick match, when Lita DDT'd Gail Kim the Champion seemed to be decided, if Trish didn't roll Lita all of a sudden to get the 3 count and to become the only 5-time Women's Champion. Singles Match Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman Eugene outsmarted and outwrestled the Coach, applying a Rock Bottom and a People's Elbow just before the pinfall, Stunning Garrison Cade after the match, and after that Stunning the Coach. I tell you, this kid has future. World Heavyweight Championship Champion Chris Benoit vs. Kane As the Bad Blood introduction said, 'To slay the monster, the champion must himself become a monster; to become the champion, the monster must evolve into pure evil.' Kane just dominated physically in this match, as Benoit could hardly stand up. Miraculously, the Rabid Wolverine threw a wrench in the gears of the Big Red Machine. While trying to apply the Crossface to Kane, he powered out by standing up, but Benoit immediately went for the other arm, and while Kane's knees fell, he turned around and pinned him with a half Nelson - cradle mix. And as he said while being interviewed by Todd Grisham after the match, he sure is for real! Hell In A Cell Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H After years of clashes and rivalry, it escalated to this. When I saw this match, I thought anyone could win. But then again, the announcers did a good job by saying that Hell In A Cell produces not winners nor losers, but survivors. These two went at it for 47 minutes and 26 minutes, with chairs, tables, ladders, and the cell itself. The most famous rivalry in the history of the WWE ended with two straight Pedigrees. HBK and Triple H gave it their all and then some, so much that Evolution had to carry The Game out of the ring. Shawn got up a few minutes later, receiving a wild ovation. Good work Shawn. And that's my review. Hope you enjoyed it.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Just got the 2004 pay-per-view on DVD.

I don't think a Pedigree would finish him, and he has made Triple H tap out to the Crossface in two house shows prior to Bad Blood. Randy Orton vs. Edge Intercontinental Championship Here we go... Since nobody has announced Evolution was banned from ringside, I am perfectly seeing Ric Flair at ringside using his dirty tactics to steal victory from Edge. So Randy it is. Chris Jericho vs. Batista Singles Match Ah, the typical 'David vs. Goliath'. I'm gonna choose Chris Jericho, and I predict Batista is gonna tap out to the Walls Of Jericho. Ric Flair and Eugene vs. La R\u00e9sistance World Tag Team Championship Eugene is a promising wrestler and Ric Flair a much more experienced wrestler than La Rez. I predict Eugene and the Nature Boy will come out on top. Matt Hardy vs. Kane No Disqualification Match Unfortunately, I predict Matt is gonna be man-handled by the Big Red Machine. As much as I like Matt Hardy, I predict Kane is pulling an easy victory. These are the announced matches for Vengeance as of today. There may be more, just like it happened at the Great American Bash from SmackDown!.

From RAW.WWE.com: SPECIAL NIGHT July 5, 2004 Eugene may have been RAW General Manager for a day, but it was Evolution who ruled Monday night in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In a Handicap Match ordered by Eric Bischoff\u2019s nephew but orchestrated by Triple H, Evolution (including honorary member Eugene) took down the team of Edge and Chris Benoit. The bout was part of The Game\u2019s master plan to wrestle the World Heavyweight Championship away from The Rabid Wolverine at Vengeance \u2014 and it seemed to be working. Evolution walked away victorious Monday, leaving Benoit unconscious and beaten in the ring. The Cerebral Assassin\u2019s mental manipulation of Eugene also paid dividends, as a conflicted Eugene broke up a Sharpshooter and set up a match-ending Pedigree with a chair shot to The Crippler\u2019s back. Monday Night RAW opened in surreal fashion as a potpourri of Superstars got a taste of what Eugene was cooking up for his special night. Eugene\u2019s first order of business was determining Randy Orton\u2019s challenger for an Intercontinental Championship match later in the evening \u2014 usually a routine matter. Instead, Eugene whittled down the hopefuls to one through a game of musical chairs. The final two were big man Tyson Tomko and Winnipeg\u2019s own Chris Jericho. To the delight of the crowd, Y2J \u201cearned\u201d the coveted match, sitting proudly in the sole remaining seat. In the Intercontinental Championship battle that followed, Jericho gave Orton all he could handle. Y2J tagged the Legend Killer with a running enzuguri. Later he reversed an RKO attempt and locked Orton in the Walls of Jericho. But the looming presence of Evolution member Batista proved too distracting for Jericho, who released the submission hold to eliminate the outside threat. It was exactly the result Batista was hoping for, and he smiled coyly as Orton propped his feet on the second rope and rolled Y2J up for the three-count. Thanks to Eugene, the animal Batista got a chance to show the world what he\u2019s made of in a match against the Big Red Monster Kane. But an enraged Matt Hardy seemed to snap, erasing the match and slamming Kane\u2019s head against the steel ring steps repeatedly. As a result, Matt Hardy will face Kane at Vengeance in a \u201cNo Disqualification\u201d Match. Eugene made plenty more news Monday. He took full advantage of his authority by making a Vengeance pay-per-view match \u2014 and putting himself in it! The team of \u201cNature Boy\u201d Ric Flair and Eugene will face World Tag Team Champions La Resistance on Sunday. This latest chapter in the life of Ric Flair must be utterly mystifying. The 16-time World Heavyweight Champion began the night playing musical chairs, then he was ordered to team with the uniquely talented Eugene in a pivotal match. All the while, Flair is preparing for the imminent release of his eagerly anticipated and extremely honest autobiography, \u201cTo Be the Man\u201d. Flair\u2019s frank discussion of his career \u2014 and those with whom he\u2019s crossed paths \u2014 is already creating a great deal of controversy. Flair also discusses his tragic youth, shedding light on some of the events that have molded the man. It\u2019s required reading for all those who have followed his storied career and a page-turner for the members of every generation of wrestling fan.

We went by my Mom's house and I changed my Cats' food and played with the babies a little while. Then we drove to the hospital, PVH, where my Mom is and I went and hung out with my Mom for about an hour. After that I came back to my Dad's Apartment and here I am now, being bored and updating.

I've just found out it's either $1.75 a pop (to swim at the pool) or $60 quarterly (thats a better deal if I'm gonna stick with the deal). Also on top of the swimming I need to tone up (I would make people go blind if I was in a Speedo) so I'm going to start doing sit-ups, crunches and also start running more (ick - I hate running).

I was like up in the front of the line and they kept like screaming at me to move and they all cut me. I know this sounds lame - but it sucked. What was I gonna do? Obviously I cant push them outta the way like I would a guy, cuz they're girls - and I'm not going to rat on them to the teacher; so I just had to live with being in the back of line. I guess my satisfaction can be that I'm still a better dancer then they are. In Geometry today we messed around again, but it wasn't as fun because two of the key people I goof off with were absent today - so it was one goofer-offer and then the two serious people: our \"Humble Leader\" Marcella and Rachel \"Our Secretary\". We all have titles, because we're doing this thing where each person in the class (in a group) is assigned a project [or section] of Chapter 5 to teach to the class. My title is the \"Substitute Person\". This is actually kinda funny - I guess reading about it rather then being there makes it less fun. In Multimedia it was a cool day. It really sucked because Adan wasn't there (he must still be sick) and that class isn't the same without him. I never thought I would openly say I have guy-friends who I \"love\" but him and several others are even cooler then \"like\". Not, like/love in a sexual way, obviously - but they're like...better then friends. Almost like people I consider to be brothers. Anyways - in Multimedia today I was the photographer person for this project we're doing there and that was kinda fun. Then Mr. Pearson took several pictures of me for my project that I had to erase the background on, and then I'm going to add my pictures onto a background of some place to travel to. Its going to be pretty fun I think - and they're going to turn out good. After school I went home to where I finished clearing the backgrounds from the pictures of myself, and then proceeded to HMWK and eating. Dinner was good - consisted of some little mini steaks that my Mom cooked well and some of the best mashed potatos I've ever tasted. My Mom said she used whipping cream rather then half half or milk - and man we need to start using the stuff more when making mashed potatos.

It sucks that I missed church today because I wanted to see my friends and since there was no XSCAPE on Friday because there was a Marriage Seminar - I didn't get to see them till today - so now I wont get to see them till Friday. I found out one of my friends has been in the hospital for 2 days with the flu *shiver*. In San Diego we supposedly have some strain of the flu that the vaccine does not protect against - it just helps give you a more managable strain of the flu or something like that - so its cool the Hospital people were able to take care of Adan (the friend in the hospital).

Today it was cool because we had 20 minutes to run atleast 6 laps (1/4 miles each) rather then run a mile and you're scored by your time. I actually made the cut today, so I guess it counts as an \"A\". My friend Adan has been out of school now for two weeks, which is a bad sign since he was in the hospital with the flu, his condition likely got worse.

I stayed strong and didn't cry, but my Mom broke down like three times in the little room where they ask you a million questions. We went inside of the actual place and looked at the kennels and they were like feline condos. They were rooms about the size of my bedroom (how cool!) and the cats had like these huge fort thingies to play around in. I would want to live in there if I was a cat. After we got done there we drove back to Chula Vista and went to this Sushi place, but we forgot its closed on Mondays, so we didn't get Sushi, but my Mom saw one of her friends at the nail place next door and they stood at the car and talked for literally 1.5 hours...I was bored to tears. After we left there we went for lunch at the 50's Diner where I got Pork Chops and then we went shopping after that. At the store we went to, I got two pairs of pants, a sweater and some long sleve'd shirts which rock-cat-butt. After that I went back home and waited for the skirmish with my Dad to take place. He finally showed up late \" Howwwww Disrespectfulllll \" as my dearest father would say. This morning I called him and asked to stay home just because I didn't feel like dealing with his crap and he tried a guilt trip that I kinda ruined. He was like \"If you don't want to come over, then don't come over for presents either.\" So I was like, \"Ok, then do you want me to mail your presents?\" and it was really funny cuz he was speechless. He thought that would make me like come running over - where in moderation I could give a crap about his presents. No present is worth putting up with his immature crap. I would rather clean an oven or something. I could deal with that brain damage at school if I wanted to. After our little supervised immature skirmish thingie, some of my Mom's friends came over and like completely surprised her since shes been pretty sick. They came with some awesome Philapino food that we like pigged out on (not literally) and it was awesome. Then they made Martinis and got drunk and acted kinda wierd (but it was funny.) Misty, my cat, has been super cuddly tonight with me since her babies are gone now. Its been a little strange because since shes been a Mom shes been kinda anti-social. Last night we went shopping at Horton Plaza Mall, went to Seaport Village and then went to the Hyatt 40th Floor and got Drinks and Poo-Poos. It was pretty cool. After that we went to the Navy Exchange (Dept Store for narrow-minded brainwashed Navy 'folk) and I got some new clothes - and my Mom got some new shoes and clothes as well. Over the last weekend I saw \"The Last Samurai\" with Tom Cruise and \"Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" and they were both pretty good. Although LOTR was very off the book - they twisted around two of the major themes from the book. On the other hand, Last Samurai was the best movie I've ever seen in my life. I loved that movie a lot. I'm really gonna buy it. One of the best things about that movie was it had romance, but no sex and I don't recall it having any cursing either...which are always a plus. I opened a few Christmas presents already and I got a new cell phone that actually has a plan rather then the pre-paid one, got some clothes, got the movie \"The Ring\" and something else I kinda forgot about *gasp*.

When we got to Oakland Airport we took the BART (Bay Area Regional Transportation) which is a high speed public transit train (goes above and below ground) to San Fransisco and then took a Taxi from the BART Station to our Hotel. We stayed at the San Fransisco Carlton and it was pretty nice. They had free Wine and Cheese and all that good stuff in the lobby (too bad I'm not 21) free for adults - so that shows how nice it was. Anyways, after we un-packed we went to this little Resturaunt down the street that was Italian (all the people who worked there including the cook were Chinese) and we had some pretty good food. I ordered Veal Parmasagne (one of my favorite dishes) and then we went back to the room and hit the sack. After flying all day we were all pretty tired. On the second day we went down to Lombard Street on the Cable Car and then to Fisherman's Wharf, and later on to Japantown. At Japantown we went to this Japanese Buffet place and got all this awesome Japanese food that would have cost a fortune at a non-buffet resturaunt. After that we went to all these cute little Japanese stores and bought some cool stuff. After that we went back to the room and crashed. On the third day in San Fran we went to Chinatown where we looked at leather jackets, eat some dim sum and I bought this cool Dagger thing (my xmas present to myself.) We took Gail to the BART Station for her ride home and then my Mother and I got on the MUNI Metro (A Public Train that runs just in San Fransisco - above and below ground) to Haight/Ashbury, this area where all the hippys used to hang out and we went in some really curious stores. One had a bong that was larger then I was...and I'm pretty big. After that we went to a Coffee shop and got some Tea, and then went to this Cheese store and got some Gouda and this nasty Non-Alcoholic Peach Wine Stuff. We took the MUNI back to our hotel and then watched TV for awhile and crashed. On the 4th Day we went to Chinatown again and bought leather jackets (my Mom and I both bought them.) Later that day we went to Union Square (the 7 story Macys) and later went to Japantown - back to the same Buffet we went to on day #2. The last day we stayed in our room (it was stormin' in San Fransisco) and we took the Bus to the BART Station and took the BART back to Oakland. We rode the AirBart to the Airport in Oakland and then departed back to San Diego. On the flight I actually fell asleep for like the 2nd time every I fell asleep on a plane to be woken up by this little kid behind me screaming about \"PIKKKKKKACHU!\". I wanted to turn around and strangle the little kid.... We got back home \"home sweet home\" and just like hung out...today is the first time since Monday Afternoon that I've left home. What I got for Christmas: Digital Camera, Phone, Sweaters, Phone, ReChargable Batteries with Charger, Cologne, Candy, Leather Jacket, Indiana Jones DVD Set, Bad Boys II DVD, Termenator III DVD and some other usuaul stuff. It was pretty good this year overall. I got my parents books and my Mom got some CDs too (Yo-Yo MA).

It was a really enjoyable time other then my constant fighting with Gail because she is ghetto and wierd. We got the Southern California Residents two day tripper and went to Disneyland Park on Sat where we rode every ride except the rides in Toontown. And we went to The Blue Bayou for lunch, which was a five star resturaunt inside of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride where I ordered Prime Rib and got Birthday Mouse. Gail took a used candle from my Birthday Mouse and put it in her purse. Maybe she'll try to sell it? Thats what I mean by Ghetto. And we still have a day in California Adventure which were going to use around the end of the month, the next weekend I'm with my mother. Right when I got back from Disneyland and went back to school on Monday the 12th, I was completely loaded down with work in school. The whole week I was completely stressed out with finals coming up and I was kept very busy. Most of the week I was running on caffine. Thank God for Coffee. On Friday January 16th 2004 I ran my Dance/PE running final and made a really good time. Where I usually fail the runs, I made a C on the final at 11:30 for a mile, which was really good. Dance/PE is the class I was most stressing about. And I took a Geometry make up test on which I scored well too. I got a 79%, and even though thats a C, its still good. It didn't drop my grade that much, I still have a 93%. I'm hoping to makeup for the grade a bit on the final and get it up to a 94% so I have a flat A, rather then an A-. For my B-day, belatedly, my Dad took me shopping and I got some clothes, some new Vans and three DVDs. The DVDs were Pirates of the Caribbean, Underworld and LOTR: The Two Towers (Extended.) Also Adan Padilla and I were working on our Multimedia Final as a team and produced a pretty cool looking, but amateur animation in Macromedia Flash. He came and hung out at my Mom's house and we worked on the animation for four to five hours and he ate over there. We bonded quite a bit, I learned some interesting things about him, and then he took off home at around eight pm. I've started a web design buisness as well, and I've been having quite a fun time doing that. I'm making quite a lot money and hopefully I'll go somewhere far with the skills I'm developing.

So I'm going to have a lot more opportunities with Blurb.

Things To Be Thankful For, which is also on my website, was publised in the January Issue of Blurb and I made $20 off of it. Since this is the start of the semester, I have to work back up an insurance grade. In English I had such a high average, that missing a couple of assignments would have still kept me at an A.

Work that was due today, yesterday and the day before I haven't even touched yet. I'm going to do it Saturday during Saturday school and turn it in Monday. If I would have done it ahead of time, and got it in early I could have scored a bunch of extra credit - which would have also helped me in that class build up an insurance grade (my phrase for it) since I usually get a bad grade on most of the quizs.

I've been getting awesome ideas from the newspaper for stuff to write about and I've been working as a journalist to go out there and get people's opinions at my school so I can make my aritcles more interesting and related to my school. My Dad was telling me that he can get back issues of LA Times free from where he works because when the newspapers get three days old they throw them out. That newspaper also has some interesting articles that I've been using. Although I still prefer The Union Tribune - San Diego's Newspaper better.

My dance final I scored a \"C\" which is not fair in my opinion. I did better then a C...I deserved atleast a B, but an A would have been nice too.

She was only in the hospital four days, including the day they actually did the surgery which went like 4 1/2 hours. The second day she was in there, it was a little creepy. She had cords all over her and she showed me her scar from where they cut her open and it was really ick. There were like 6 staples, this little bottle to collect the icky drainage gunk and then like a thing that caught her urine and went up into her bladder (that must have hurt.) School has been pretty busy. I've been giving more to Newspaper, and the advisor doesn't tell me about a lot of stuff. I guess maybe she doesn't think I've proven myself as editor or something? But it really sucks sometimes. I'm supposed to be the Newspaper editor and she like...just expects me to read her mind and stuff - and no one tells me ahead of time about upcoming events and such. I should talk to her about it or something - maybe it will accomplish something, maybe not. Lately I've been getting ready for competitive swimming which is coming up soon. It's gonna rock. She also helped Rachel pay for her bathing suit and I've gotten pretty close to Rachel. It's nice. I just wonder if its because she wants my Mom's help or because she really likes me. But who knows, shes getting touchy and huggy - so that would make me thinks it's real. On Valentines day I bought three roses, unfortunatly they only had red ones...but oh well. I gave one to my math teacher (she was a little...surprised I guess), one to Lilianna and one to Rachel. Rachel gave me a hug, Lilianna was shy and was like \"from you!?\" but she liked it. Mrs. Hernandez was \"Thank you sweetie.\" But no hug... She probably thinks I'm a freak or something. Last night I was talking to one of my best friends, and I told him something like really personal and now he's avoiding me...so I think I might have done something stupid by telling him...so I hope I didn't just ruin my life at school or something.

I have quite a bit of Biology HMWK, have English HMWK and I have to make up some Geography HMWK because the teacher messed up and lost my paper or something. Competitive swimming has practices every weekday and some Saturdays from 3:30 - 5:30 pm. I've been going to every practice and I've went from size 42 pants to size 38 which is really an accomplishment for two weeks time. School has been as crazy as ever. I'm still pulling an almost 4.0 along with swimming and Newspaper. My life now officially revolves around like 90% school related stuff. But anyways, we got early grades, they dont actually come out until Tuesday and in Geography the teacher gave me a \"B!\" I got a B and I turned in all of the assignments. A lot of other people are angered and complaining as well as me. She was not the most happy person today. She even notices I was pretty mad. She was like \"I'm sure if you knew VooDoo I would be dead right now.\" Fortunatly for her I do not know Voo Doo. Miss Derwin is helping me step out of my comfort shroud and step up more and more as newspaper editor, so she is having me do a complete newspaper issue, which is good and bad. Bad - because sports isn't my thing and we're a little blank on it. Good because I can do things my way and not have to comply as much with how Miss Derwin wants to do things. I know thats a bad attitude to have...but I have a lot of good ideas that Miss Derwin doesn't always want to go along with. I've had an interview with the Principal on the whole issue at school where we get detention if we're late to first period and I asked her if there is any end in sight...and she said no. It was an interesting interview, but she didn't want the evil administrator image I wanted to portray. Boo. Mrs Angela Hermamdez is officially the coolest CPH faculty member who is currently living or who will probably ever live. She is really sweet, seems to really love /care about me, and she really bails me out of everything in her class. I really dont know why she does it, I've never met a teacher as giving as her. I mean...I so suck at math it looks like I dont even try...and you can see she thinks that, but she hasn't given up yet. If I had a student like me I would have given up so long ago. We had a swim meet yesterday and I swam a 100 free, 100 breast, 400 freestyle relay, and 200 IM relay. I made 2nd place on the 100 freestyle and on the 400 freestyle IM. I got disqualified on the 200 IM relay and I scored last place on the breast. As hard as it is to admit this, Isaac Martinez, one of my best friends but also a long time rival, is officially better than me. I mean...my stroke looks so much better, but he is faster. I guess what I have going for me though, is I know how to pace myself and he either doesn't know how, or doesn't want to. On the 100 freestyle he only beat me by like a second though. My goggles came off when I dove in because there was not a seal on my face cuz it was dry, and they went down to my mouth. I was slower because I didn't flip-turn since my goggles were making it harder to breathe, and if I would have I could have beaten him because he doesn't pace himself. I've been neglecting the Christian Club at school lately but I have still been going occasionally. Last weekend I went to ATF, which is Acquire the Fire, a Christian Youth conference and I had like a weekend of hell. Most people had a lot of fun, but I guess I'm hard to please or something like that. I had to share a room with this very ignorant guy and he made the whole room suffer with his ignorance. He was running up and down the hall like a savage and randomly knocking on people's doors with no regard to the fact it was late and they could have been sleeping and he kept the rest of us up with this stupidity. I would have liked to imflict physical pain to him...but then it was a Christian thing. And I'm not an agressive person anyways. I just wish I could do that kinda stuff where in reality I'm all mouth. (all bark no bite so to say) Anyways I couldn't sleep, ATF was really long, my CD got stolen, I got dirty water thrown on me, I got in the middle of a mosh-pit...and it just sucked. I felt like the people that were running the event from my church and then the ATF people couldn't have cared if I lived or died, and thats really sad when you think of your church like that because they are supposed to love and care about you like a lot. Good thing I guess is I saw Ricky Valdez again but I didn't get to talk to him at all really. Just wassup, how ya doing, ok see ya around. Not that the conversation would have been facinatingly interesting anyways. He probably would have been preaching to me or something. Lately I haven't really been wanting to go to church and my Mom makes me go...sucks. I wish I could just not go at all. I would have like more free time for other stuff. I mean, I can love God and be a Christian and all that jazz without going to waste two hours of my time. They should have drive up worship services where you get like a 10 second summary of the message and what it means to me, get hugged and take off. What difference does it make if you have to sit there for two hours?

The pieces I didn't like were a couple of really sleezy pieces where the dancers were dressed like whores (literally) and dancing to some music from Moulon Rouge, which was fitting to the costumes, but it was very untasteful and shouldn't have been in a dance concert. Another thing I didn't like is between almost every piece they closed the curtain and turned the lights back on and had this long pause before getting started on the next piece. My current dance teacher choreographed one of the pieces in the dance and today she was telling me that there were a lot of technical issues in her dance and she was really mad about it...but I didn't really notice them.

After I was done at the Dentist my Mom had to get a bunch of stuff done and as it turns out she has to get more then $2000 worth the stuff done on herself, not to mention the $400 she has to pay for my two tooth exposures.

I did try Thai Iced Tea that was interesting but all of the food was greesey and had a strange sweetish after taste. Other Thai food I've had didn't have that. But the Tea, as I said, was good. It was regular iced tea with milk and sugar cain juice in it, which made it very unique. Right before we went to the Thai place my Mom had to go in this damn Sorority store, because College Grove is by SDSU, hence the name, and she was looking around at all this shit she isn't going to possibly buy. She has to go in every fucking store!!! I'm so sick of it. And then after the Thai place she went to Vons, a grocery store, to buy **MORE** food. Like we need more!

I\u2019ve been doing Newspaper still, been doing competitive swimming, had several holidays, been on several vacations, had oral surgery, been at war with both parents and a lot more fun stuff. Through swimming we\u2019ve had very few male swimmers because two quit, one transferred schools and two others weren\u2019t eligible (the un-eligible ones are our fastest and best guys) so that left three guys. We aren\u2019t bad swimmers, but we\u2019re definitely not the best either. Of those three guys, I was probably the worst of the three, maybe the second worst. But this one guy I\u2019ve known since like 4th grade, Isaac Martinez, is much better then me, and he reminded me of that everyday of swimming (hence the season, at least for me is over.) My theory behind rubbing his speed into my face is that I\u2019ve been better at him in pretty much every other area since like 4th grade. Smarter, got all the positions of power (Student government and club chairs), been more outgoing, etc. The only things he\u2019s better than me at are getting the girls, and swimming. But then my swimming stroke looks better than his, and I\u2019m not into girls, if you get what I mean. Swim meets have been interesting. They\u2019ve been swimming me in a large variety of events. My best events seem to be the 100 Butterfly, the 100 Breaststroke and the 200 Freestyle. I did moderately well at every event I swam, excluding the 500 freestyle. Although I\u2019m really happy the year is over. It gets really old, really fast swimming back and forth across a pool. Also, a lot of the people on the swim team had something against me. There is a large clique on the team that includes the majority of the girls and their humble leader didn\u2019t like me, so they didn\u2019t either. Plus blurting out my opinions didn\u2019t exactly help. Christina, Jessica, Isaac, David, Denise, Abigail and Alya were the only people I got along with really well. Without them I wouldn\u2019t have been able to bear this season, because the other people just ignored me. Jessica even at times didn\u2019t talk to me much because she was involved with the clique a little bit and understandably would rather have like 20 friends then just me. She was never mean like the cliquey people, but not super friendly either. In school I\u2019ve been doing a lot better in all my classes, excluding Multimedia because I\u2019m rarely there due to swim meets and other things at school. That\u2019s the class that\u2019s the least important to me, so I don\u2019t do near enough work in it. In Dance I\u2019ve been doing much better and I can\u2019t stress how cool the teacher, Mrs. Macias is. She has become my favorite teacher, or second favorite teacher. She is awesome, she encourages us, and the other day when two girls didn\u2019t feel like running because of the heat, she started running with them. That gave me a tremendously larger amount of respect for her. And I already had a major amount of respect for her before that incident. Lately, per advise of Miss Derwin, the Newspaper Advisor at my school, I\u2019ve been getting involved in this organization known as book crossing. Its basically where you trade books with people through the mail, \u201cforget\u201d books places for people to pick them up, read them, recycle them and log them on the website, tracking them on their journey around the world. I\u2019m #51 in California as of right now, out of 18,000 people in the state, which is quite an accomplishment. They measure your rank based on how many books you register and such. During Spring Break I went to Avalon, Santa Catalina Island which was really fun. My Mom and I had a couple days of relaxation. I went kayaking, snorkeling and just hung out. I also probably gained weight from all the Ice Cream and awesome food I ate there. To get to Catalina, you take a boat from either Long Beach or Dana Point California for 30 miles to Catalina. Since we had a high-speed boat it only took around an hour, but on a regular speedboat it would take quite a long time. Perhaps 3-4 hours. My GPA at school is still staying up. On the last report card, 12-week mark, I only had one B in Scholarship and only one B in Citizenship. So I had a 3.87 in Scholarship and Citizenship. I need to haul ass to get it to a 4.0 though. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of reading and been working on my website too. Also in my free time, which there is little of, I\u2019ve been back on Hogwarts Moo but I have concluded half of the people on there are evil and deserve to have their whole bodies waxed, or other equally painful deeds. Listening to more and more country music these days. Not say that I\u2019m a country fan now, but I\u2019m into Shania Twain and the Dixie Chicks now. They\u2019re pretty good. This summer I got into Southwestern College. Through persistence and filling out petitions and having forms signed by my school guidance counselor, the Dean of Outreach accepted me. Only bad part about the whole SWC thing is that one of my classes, the Dance one with Macias, my current dance long term-sub starts on June 7th and my school doesn\u2019t end until June 18th, so it should be fun keeping good grades at both places.

Throughout the movie it showed Brad Pitt (Achilies) and his emotional battle through life. He tried to be tough but through several emotional losses throughout the movie, it showed he really does posses love and above all else, honor. Orlando Bloom's (Paris) character was a little disappointing. He had very little honor through the movie (until the end) and just...wasn't the typical character that Orlando Bloom plays.

Today she called me and almost immediatly she started nagging about something. She added two days to my \"sentence\" of no computer until June (that started because I said it was immature to say you hate something whole when you're only familiar with part of it) and ways...continuing from where I left off, she added two more days to my sentence for me not making my bed to \"her liking.\" And then she added two more days for me explaining to her what the movie \"The Village\" is about. My biggest pet-peeves about how she acts is that her gods are the television and the phone. She swears shes never on the phone, but like...whenever I call shes like \"I'll call you back, I'm on the phone right now\" so shes in denial about it... Then at home whenever I go in the room where she is, shes like \"shh! I'm watching tv! You always interrupt me when I'm watching tv!\" so I ask her when I should talk to her since shes always watching tv or on the phone and I'd be \"interrupting\" and she says \"during a commercial\". She records every channel from 8-10 every night (we dont have cable so thats only like 5 channels...imagine if we did have cable) so she fast forwards during commercials, so that gives me like 20 seconds tops. Then when I'm doing something, being on the computer, reading, relaxing in my bed listening to music, etc and she makes me come into her room and \"talk to her\" which always leads to getting me in some kind of trouble because I usually am not to happy about dropping what I was doing and having to \"talk\" to her, so I \"have a attitude\" or some shit like that. Right now I'm so fed up with her that I took the liberty of posting countdown timers in this blog and my personal blog (at the bottom and at the end of every post) of how long I have before I'm out of here and at college where she will have no more control over me. Maybe when I'm an adult and I can tell her to go screw herself when she is being irrational we'll get along better. She wants me to be her friend one minute and the next she's my \"Mom\" and I'm being disrespectful. She cant have it both ways. But for awhile now, since probably last December I've been strongly disliking her and I wish she would just leave me alone. Given that if she did \"leave me alone\" I probably wouldn't be as good as I am, but still. I haven't even had a childhood past the age of four or five because she has treated my like an adult my whole life and when I do something thats remotely \"teenage\" she gets all pissed and punishes me. My Dad says she's substituting me for her husband that she doesn't have anymore but where a husband is a consenting adult I'm not and she can control me. Dont take that last comment wrong like we have an incestuous relationship or something *gag* thats just sick demented thinking. I sure hope my Dad isn't thinking that... cuz anymore I dont even hug her. Another thing too...sometimes she plays around and like hits me or tickles me or something and then I cant do it back \"because I have fibermyalagia and it hurts me!\" but she can do it to me to her hearts content. What wrong with that? Then whenever she has a chance she uses that analogy \"if you cant take it dont dish it out\"!! Right now I wish she would just...move away and leave me alone. I'm already practically an \"old\" adult so...what do I need her for? My friends are always raging on me about how I need to act more teenage and stuff...but its hard. I've seriously never been given a chance to just be a kid. On the other hand I've had a pretty spoiled life and stuff, but I want to be loved too. I dont think my Mom knows how to really love. All her anger that she just holds on to gets in the way. She is still holding on to anger from when she was a little kid and it shows occasionally when she explodes and starts screaming. I look at my friends and how well they get along with their parents, how much they both love and like their parents. Adan totally clicks with both of his parents. Isaac and his parents like adore each other. Then this one youth leader guy that used to go to my church, Cornerstone and went away to college has literally the most perfect family. The only comparison of friends to my family would be Lisa and Beth, and then they're like 200x worse off them me. But I'm not gonna touch that today. Heard of Goodbye Earl?

Also last night Lisa came over and we picked \"Dare You to Move\" by Switchfoot for my choreography project and did a couple of ballet/modern moves, but none of them truly apply to the song.

Bad classes: Today in Biology we got a pop quiz and I totally failed it. We needed to know in what sequence blood flows through this strange picture of the heart and I wasn't at school the day the teacher taught that, so I died. In 5th period it was super hard. Surface area of prisms. The teacher looked like she was ready to collapse too. Probably had an exciting night with her husband, if you get what I mean. Plus a long day at school and I was like \"Mrs. Hernandez! Mrs. Hernandez\" every 2 minutes because I was absent, hence lost, and needed help with my math homework. In 6th Period we worked on the video editing and finally I have someone that understands some English. She is their VO (voice over person) so its getting better. During 6th period today I went to talk to Miss. Stratton, who is the Drama teacher, and I interrupted a rehersal and she got snappy. I went back after class though and she was much better. She was like \"since you're not in Drama you dont know this, but NEVER INTERRUPT A REHERSAL.\" So I learned something new today. Went to La Bellas for dinner. Also went to the post office and spent like $20 between two Priority Mail domestic documents and one international. Also talked to Christian from Cornerstone. He's a pretty cool guy and it was nice getting to talk to him again, although I still think Cornerstone went commercial and that the Pastor is now speaking more for the general TV audiance then the people who attend his church.

I jump out of my skin because I set it very loud so I would wake up right away, and it was successful. I slowly walk to the bathroom, in my comatose state, and turn on the shower, trying not to collapse in fatigue. Once the shower water heats up, which takes about 4 minutes because it is at the end of the hot water line, I get into the shower and slowly wake up as the hot water hits my body. After I get out of the shower, I run to my room and turn on the radio to get dressed to. Once I\u2019m done I go into the kitchen where my Mom is getting our food for the day ready. We get in the car, go to Jack in the Box, get some breakfast sandwiches, go to 7-11 to get ice and some hot dogs and then we take off to the park, Morely Field in Balboa Park. 6:30 am We park at Morely Field and start to unload the car and setup in the dirt under some trees. We pitch out tent for the day and setup out chairs. We\u2019re ready to relax. I go to table 6 to check in with my study advisors, along with 200 other study participants. They hand me a \u201cWeekend in the Park\u201d t-shirt, and a bottle of water and then tell me to come back to the table in 10 minutes, and to stay in the immediate area of the setup area. 8:00 am After this time we had already had about 4 meet ups during which we had to fill out diary cards depicting out allergy symptoms for the day. I thought it would be an easy day and an easy $440, but I was dead wrong. They sure made us work for that money. Next, at like 8:15 we had breakfast. They served juice, Danish, fruit, croissants and muffins. We had almost an hour to eat this time and then we went back for a bunch more diary cards to fill out and got drugged at 9:00. Placebo Group On the second day my allergies were much worse and I have concluded that I was part of the Placebo group, which is sugar water and doesn\u2019t actually have any active ingredient in it, hence not preventing any allergies. I was dying and probably went through a grand total of 5 boxes of tissues. This worked in my favor to get me on TV though. Reporters from \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d with Peter Jennings was there recording and they got me on camera sneezing my head off, blowing my nose and they then asked me if I wanted to be interviewed on TV. I was all for the interview and now am going to be on TV either Tuesday or Wednesday, they weren\u2019t sure which day, but all the same I will air around the us for sure. My d\u00e9but of fame!

We got compeltely done with a bunch of different poses and shots in about two hours. It would have been faster if everyone would have showed up on time though. I had to call and wake Ron up, he had apairently went to a concert the night before, Shavelle was a little late but I'm just happy she showed up because I didn't get her number and we wouldn't have been able to do it without her. Then Adan, of course, came, although I had to call and wake his ass up too. He showed me his arm, his chest and his leg where poison oak hit it...and ick. It was really gross. And he put some kind of lotion on it or something for the itch and it made it look like some of the boils had burst and there was puss or something...it was nasty - and now I really feel bad calling him a whimp and everything last night on AIM because wow...thats like...bad. I would be dying, figuratively, if I had all that on my arm. He must have had a serious allergic reaction or something. During the Saturday School people's 10 minute break between session 1 and session 2 at 10:00 we had people all around so we had to pause for awhile before resuming filming and this one guy, who I cant say I'm surprised had Saturday school as he is a nuisance in my 4th period class - wanted to moon the camera and I think I would have honestly been scared for life had I seen his ass... bad thought. But then since he's a jock, it mighta been good looking too, you never know with jocks these days. Shavelle walked most of the way home with me and then departed to wait for her mother. After we left the school, that is my Dad picked me up at my mother's house (LOTR3 came!) my Dad picked me up, we drove downtown to the building where he works, I sat in the car awhile reviewing my tape, he came out, drove clear back home to get his glasses or pager or something and then we drove back to Mission Valley and saw PoA (Harry Potter 3) which I think was really good, although I'm a little disappointed that they didn't show more of Harry's classes, especially developing his classes with Lupin. They showed how Harry and Lupin were really close and stuff, but they didn't show how that relationship between them developed. Also the ending was a little spuratic...but the movie had a lot funnier stuff then the last two, which was cool. Also it was a lot darker, more for adults and teens then kids like the last two. IT wasn't a happy world of magic doing and stuff. What was really wierd is that the theatre had more adults then it had kids and there was this guy sitting next to me that was a space nerd...he was talking about how he wanted to make a car that had all these things you're likely to hear about on Star Trek or something...I was trying not to crack up. After that we went to DZ Akins and I had Mish Mash Soup and a Corned Beef Reuban. My french fries were cold though...yuck, I had to ask for new ones. Then on the way home my Dad was telling me about how truly evil my Mom is. If that stuff he said is true, and I know at least some of it is, shes a lot worse inside then she is externally with me...thats kinda a scary thought. Is she going to get worse with her stupid rules and punishments then she already is? Her last punishment, thou shalt not use thy washer and thy dryer was stupid. Thats like saying I cant use the shower at home anymore, I have to go in the backyard. Is the no more shower going to be her next rule?

I'm no good, I never do anything she asks me, I'll never amount to anything, she's ashamed to call me her child and other stuff that I can't rember right now. Anyways, to make a long story short she said that I cant do my laundry at home anymore because I didn't want to get out of bed and go do it right when she said and she pointed out that I do this all the time, which is so not true. Yesterday I had told my Dance teacher about all the drama with my Mom and today she asked me how its going, so I told her about all this and she was like \"whoa.\" But she also said \"Hey, I didn't pick my parents either\" so I guess she can relate to me in other ways. I still dont know if my Mom is going to pay for dance in the fall. I seriously doubt she will because she is the cheapest person on the face of the earth, but I really hope she will. She only actually has to pay half of $65 plus transportation...and that really isn't much for college classes. What would she do if I went to UCSD or something and it was outrageous.

She went all over the whole city of Long Beach looking for this Krispy Kream, as if she needs doughnuts. I'm not saying that like I'm all skinny, but I know I dont need more carbs or fat...but she like...doesn't get that yet and then says she wants to lots weight...grr! The first night there, after she screamed at me the whole way there because she got bad directions from Map Quest and it was my fault, as everything else in life is, we checked in and then went to this Resturaunt called Monteray Bay Canners, which has some romantic significance to her because her and my father used to go there in Hawaii. The resturaunt totally sucked, was very over priced the waitress was terrible. I got some Shrimp that cost her like a mint and some other stuff that was just whatever. I would have rather went to Mimi's Cafe or something. Someplace I already know is good, but Noooo! Then the next day I slept in and she was just as bitchy. Thats when we took that coast drive thing. Well after that when I got on the phone with my Dad she started harassing me so I got off the phone then she hit me or something and I called her a bitch, which is is by the way, figuratively, and then she grounded me more! When will I learn? She is a matriarch, there is no freedom from here, guilty until proven innocent, etc. Sometimes I wonder if she even knows anything about America. We drove home on Sunday, she hated me even more and let me know it the whole way home and she was like on the phone the whole way home ignoring me and then complaining about my music when she wasn't. I put in all these different CDs trying to find one that she likes. Ones that a month ago she likes now she doesn't because she just wants to disagree with me about something. She had to drive on this costal highway that was totally congested on the way home too, just to make me miserable and make it take longer. And then when we got to San Onofre she had to pull over onto the state beacuse which is like...nuclear waste and stuff. I think she wants to kill all my little fishies (sperm) by subjecting me to all that crap (I'm serious - its a nuclear waste area - but a nuclear reactor.) We drove around for like 30 minutes so she could find the freeway (I-5) while she kept on commenting about how \"this is really creepy\" and how she doesn't want to be here. It's like, hello dude, you're the one who freakin' pulled over here!! One good thing is on the way home we went to this one good Jewis Delicatessan place in Encinitas which totally rocked. I got a Corned Beef Reuban, Mish Mash Soup and ate tons of the pickles on the table which were totally awesome pickles. I'm a pickle person... Anyways on the way home she went on and on about how ashamed of me she is, how bad of a child I am because I don't kiss her ass and on and on and on. She said from now on I'm to go to straight to my room when I get home at night because I'm so bad and stuff. Then she called my aunt and put on this fake accent to pretend like she actually cares about my aunt. I think she was just bored. Then she told me because I'm an evil sinner we're going to church, which actually turned out to be somewhat amusing. I wasn't bored out of my mind for a change and actually got something out of it. Whats really sad, though, is that I think the only reason she even went to church was because she had some Avon business with this one lady. She thinks this lady is inferior or something to her so she like was very rude to the lady and like was in her face, right at church. I guess she wasn't kidding when she said shes the same at church as she is anywhere. \"She doesn't pretend\". I guess thats good. People can see she really is a filty bitch.

Well after the eating the youth people did a little skit making fun of the graduating seniors and then we had this dancing thing which was pretty fun but I couldn't really get into any of the music so it wasn't really that fun.

This desire for preeminence isolates him and inhibits his readiness to give himself freely. While he wants to surrender and let himself go, he regards this as a weakness which must be resisted. This self-restraint, he feels, will lift him above the rank and file and ensure recognition as a unique and distinctive personality.\" My Restrained Characteristics: \"Feels that he is receiving less than his share and that there is no one on who he can rely for sympathy and understanding.

In this movie, as in Pitch Black, Fast and the Furious, and XXX he was a criminal who turned out to be a hero in the end. The movie shows a Sci Fi(sh) cult movement invade planets and convert people to their faith (make them followers) in more sense then one or exterminate them.

Vin Diesal\u2019s character, Riddick goes through some crazy trials including running across a planet that had no atmosphere thus was 700 + degrees Celsius when the sun was shining on it and \u2013200 Celsius when the sun is not shining on it. Well, when the sun was shining he and his girlfriend somehow managed to not melt and escape in a space ship that didn\u2019t melt.

All the classes were uneventful and we basically just had to sit there for 30 minutes while our teachers wrote out our grades. It sucked to say bye to the forementioned teachers though...cuz they really rock. I wish I could have them next year. My other teachers are neither really good or really bad, just whatever. My PE teacher I will have again next year though...so lets hope that goes good. At my college yesterday, after I typed my paper for my dance class, I went to Counseling and I got some papers with all the under-grad requirements for a Psychology B.S Major and for a Biology B.S major at both UCSD and UC Davis. I'm thinking of maybe a Psychology B.S with emphasis on Biology. T'would be interesting to take Psychology as a major with Dance as minor.

I called my Mom and was asking her if she would pay half of the fees for my college text book and she said yeah and then I walked toward my Dad and so he could hear her say \"yes\" and he got up any walked into the other room *Snort* that was mature... Then my Mom went on and on about how if she finds a cheaper one outside of the campus bookstore I'm paying her back all the difference. She is too lazy to drive out to the college and give me a ride but I bet almost anything she is going to make a special trip and burn $5 worth the gas to affirm that there is or is not a cheaper book. She'll probably find a book that has a different title thats cheaper then the campus bookstore and tell me I should get (given) book because it is, after all, a psychology book . She is the cheapest bastard in the world.

Just myself and (Geography Teacher's name here) I got to talk to her some and opened up with some stuff to her and she was pretty supportive about the secretive stuff. Also I explained my whole ordeal in middle school to her and she doesn't particularly like the culprit's son anymore then I do. She was telling me that he, everyday just eats his whole Geography period and like does no work. So I guess he is really the loser I thought him to be along with his mother, who is satan. I finished my final and it was pathetic how easy the teaser questions were. I was telling the teacher some of the questions and she even got a kick out of them. Some of the questions a 1st grader could have gotten right (figuratively). I left right as my real period started and then this guy who I never particularly liked because he is somewhat annoying and one of those attention seeker class clown types, brought me my off campus pass and seemed to be really decent. I had never really talked to him before. But I guess my opinion changed of him, although he will probably continue to be an attention seeker and even though I'll like him, he'll still be annoying to me. I also found out that I won this raffle in my English class and that you had to be present to collect your prize and I wasn't...but I think it was only like a pencil or something... What sucks is I never win when I'm present for the prize...and when I do I dont actually get my prize.

This time she called me clear in the other room to turn on her tv that is on top of the refridgerator, where another tv was on in the next room, which she could see from the kitchen (I tell you she is obsessed) so when she told me to turn on the Tv on top of the refridgerator (which I might add she wouldn't be able to see while she cleans the kitchen or whatever she was doing any easier then the one in the family room) and I rolled my eyes just because it sounded stupid to me. When I rolled my eyes I happened to be twisted TURNING ON HER DAMN TV and she slapped the hell out of my face because I think her wanting to have every TV in the house on is dumb and I slapped the crap out of her too out of reflexes...if you're twisted around and someone slaps you, its an involuntary reflex to slap them back or just twitch...and my arm happened to whip around. I actually think it was pretty cool that I slapped her unvoluntarily and didn't get in trouble - which was a shock. Well she started bitching about how it was all disrespectful to roll my eyes at her and that is an an adult and can do \"whatever the fuck she wants in her house\" and that I better never say anything about her TV habit again (so she knows she is obsessed and has a problem and gets all touchy when I hint at it!) What really sucks about all this is that she totally over-reacted. I roll my eyes all the time, not like its something directed at her, its a natural thing I just do...and if she would have been asked something that ridiculous she would have rolled her eyes too (maybe /that/ wasn't ridiculous to her - but something that would be.) What really pisses me off is that she called me clear from the other room to do that when she could have easily done it herself. Everyday I hate TV more and more because I swear thats all she fucking does anymore. And when I want to go on the computer she wont leave me alone. She made some comment about how I'm back there ignoring her (but what is she doing watching TV? Socializing with me?) yet whenever I'm in the room when she's watching TV and I say something she huffs and puffs and get all pissed that I dare interrupt her precious show and she tells me to ask her during commercials, but since she records every channel that there is, there are about 10 seconds of commercials because she just fast forwards through them. GRR! Everytime I'm on the computer, I swear she finds a fucking reason to kick me off! I cant even do homework on the computer in peace (yet she wants peace to watch TV). It really sucks. Last night I was not on the computer 5 minutes and then she came in and kicked me off to use it (and check her e-mail) for a second (which lasted more like an hour) to spam up her contacts' inboxs with her shitty virus containing forwards. Even more ironically last night she had two virus containing e-mails and somehow managed to blame our last three viruses on me (when I hadn't even been on the computer in like 2 months). Then right after I actually got the computer back she called me to turn on her tv (because she is an adult who can do whatever the fuck she pleases!) I think the next time I get grounded from the computer long term (she threatoned six months at three different points last night) I'm going to get even. I'm going to go around and move her remotes some her various TVs and more them from where they should be, but have them where they're not hidden either (she doesn't like changed from her daily routine and doesn't know how to look for things, yet tells me constantly \"Its not gonna jump out and say 'here I am'\") so she has to get up off her sorry ass and look for something herself or just not watch TV (better yet.)

But I can feel myself getting stronger and toning up and I went to this church's office (that I used to go to) to say hi to this one guy, Gabe, that I like really love (in a brotherly way) and he wasn't there so I had to talk to this guy where there is mutual dislike and he was acting all political like he actually liked me *gag* and then went and talked to Christian, who isn't on the same level as Gabe, but is still a really cool guy, gave him the update and then went and talked to the office ladies who I get the impression dont like me either, but they're still much more discrete about it then the other guy. If someone doesn't like me, it pisses me off when they pretend they do...just tell me you dont like me, dont pretend you do and be nice to me, and we'll be cooler with each other. I can take that - you wont get along with everyone in life. Anyways - was giving my Dad and my Mom my little commentary on religion and our origin. They dont agree but I thought I'd post it here just in case it changes so I can look back someday. On Prayer/Meditation I believe that prayer, though it is talking to God, is not some magic method where God goes \"poof\" and whatever you pray for appears. The reason I feel is doesn't work that way is many people from many different religions pray to different deitys and they're prayers (in their opinion) are answered and then people who have no deity and just meditate still find solutions to their problems - which leads me to the conclusion (I heard this from someone else, so its not origional - but it is customized) that when we pray or meditate, through focused energy it brings us to a higer state of consciousness and we're able to think clearer and solve our own problems. On Religion Vs. Science Thought I believe in the God of the Christian/Jews/Muslims (One in the same) I dont believe word for word about the origin of the earth and I also believe Religion and Science can work together. I think God did indeed spark off the whole big bang creation thing, and he guided it, but I think he let it run its own course. Since the earth is said to be somewhere around 7 billion years old and the universe way older then that, I think that each \"day\" of his creation cycle symbolized somewhere around a billion years. So the creation of animals, he evolved them over that billion or so years and then stopped them there and went on to the next cycle. I know that is conflicting, but it makes sense for me. I used to be brainwashed into not believing in evolution at all, but agiain, there is too much evidence for it. In the end of the cycle, I believe God stopped macro evolution and then thats when natural selection and micro-evolution (adapation) came into the picture. I believe God used Evolution to create the earth, set it up so he doesn't have to intervene and then just lets it run its course. On Micro Evolution Next would be micro evolution and natural selection. I believe those are both very active today, and most narrowminded Christians that are actually informed and make some of their own opinions cant even deny that. Survival of the Fittest is in every species and ecosystem and things do adapt over time and evolve over time on a small scale. Maybe over a couple hundred years the size of a bird's beak changes to accomidate a new food source or the color of a community of rabbit's coats changes to better blend in. I do not believe that macro evolution (one species changing into another) happens anymore and if it does still happening, its very gradual and no one will ever live long enough to observe it happening - so why worry about such things? On a more Christian scale I think that people believing God *poof* gives them what they pray for, in example of someone hanging money to someone who is in need, is purely coincidence but then yet I believe in spiritual warefare too, so some of my opinions conflict. As for an afterlife (Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, Summerland, etc) I dont know what I believe. The bible seems to me to be a corrupted book that started out good and went bad. Anything written by man is corrupted because man is biased and they put their own opinions in there. As much as someone asys \"It was inspired by God\" that doesn't necessarily mean the men listened to God. And provided they did, the various translaters who switched the bible from Armanic to English and various other languages (even Latin) put their biases in there and changed it around. So how accurate is the bible to its origional context? But then who am I to say its corrupted too? I dont know that for sure. Again - these are purely opinion - which is somewhat scary since I'm the Christian Club President at my school, but maybe God is using my opinions to truly inform people? A lot of the stuff in the bible can still be accurate, but tahts also leaving room for some stuff being corrupted. What you have to do to be \"enlightened\" and go to heaven is a little farfetched and hardcore. If you really have to do all that stuff (die to yourself, sell all your stuff - give the money to the poor and follow God, etc) then very few people are actually going to heaven.

He was just like \"No\"...what kind of politically correct admin is like that. Anyways, on further, got in an argument with my Dad about how Strogonoff and Mashed Potatos done go together...and he got all pissed, got all offended and said then dont eat them *rolls eyes*. He doesn't get the concept that primarily Carb meal isn't the way to go. Noodles and Mashed Potatoes...carb heaven - but still just wrong. He was freaking out about how I need to help around the house so I vacuumed and cleaned down the bikes and watered the plants! Go me! Then we got in another argument about how he wanted me to give my bike away and I told him that Chula Vista has very few flat surfaces to ride bikes and most people I dont know wouldn't have ridden them anyways so he got all pissed about that and just blabbed on about it for like 30 minutes. I just tuned him out and nodded at the appropriate times. Mom came over and brought my dance shoes, which was really decent, and then I talked to her for awhile.

He was spitting up this crap for like a good 15 minutes and then I asked him if he was ok and he said it was just indigestion.

He's probably eated away at most of his asophagus and stomach and intestines so they can't take anymore alcohol so it causes him to puke up crap. Next will probably be heart, liver and kidney issues. The body isn't made to take that much alcohol...but I guess its his body...he has to live with it if he messes it up. What sucks for me is that my Dad's family has super addictive tendancies for a lot of stuff and I'm gonna have to be really careful as an adult or I'll probably end up being an alcoholic just like him because of the addictive personality I already have with some stuff.

My Dad and I went to the fair today and right when we went in we went over to the Student Showcase where they had the High School Newspapers and I saw the paper from my school (it was the one that had none of my articles in it\u2026) and then my Dad was moping around and looking at all this crap in the wood workers area *sigh* and it took me forever to get him to leave that area and get over the rides. He gave me $30 which as really nice \u2013 it should get me outta debt and then I can pay off my books. He bought me $20 worth the ride tickets, which was 6 rides and then I went on all sorts of their crazy rides \u2013 however I didn\u2019t get to go on the zipper. I wanted to go on the zipper but my Dad didn\u2019t and they don\u2019t allow single riders to go on it and I was alone. After going on all the rides we went and got some Australian batter fried potatoes, I got ranch and my Dad got cheese \u2013 and they were crazy big orders. We could have split an order and probably not eaten all of them. After we were leaving the area where we ate, we went by this area where this guy forcefully put us into seats where we got $12 \u2013 10 minute long full body massages. He did a really good job, although he was pretty rough at first on my shoulders and I had to ask him to be gentle. A couple of times he got a little too far down\u2026 After the massage I went and did the climbing wall thing \u2013 and because the 18 year oldish skater dude attendant guy was hitting on me (he wasn\u2019t bad looking himself) I got to climb the wall 4 times instead of just one for my $5 \u2013 so it wasn\u2019t a bad deal all in all. During my 4th time up there was this chick that was scared to repel, climbing down the call and causing a traffic jam, so I was just standing there holding on to the wall and when I finally got down, my hands and fingers and forearms were killing me (and still are \u2013 my fingers are randomly cramping up.) Well the hot guy who was hitting on me \u2013 offered for me to go up the fall a fifth time (am I that hot?) but I had to decline cuz my fingers hurt. Then after that we went to the exhibit halls and I found an ear piercing place \u2013 so I decided because they were cheap I wanted to get my left ear pierced so I did \u2013 it didn\u2019t hurt at all since she used a gun thing (I did flinch though \u2013 just nerves) and now I have a pierced ear that doesn\u2019t look to bad. I wanted to get my eyebrow pierced too, but she said they only do ears \u2013 so I guess that will be another time and another place. Before we went to the fair, my Dad took me to my Mom\u2019s to pick up the mail and these super lazy \u2013 stupid stoner neighbors of ours\u2019 kids were actually working. Their mother has to beg and plead for them to even take out the trash and the one skinny stoner dude (he constantly wears this weird cap thingie around) acts like its super hard and kills him to move the trash cans all of 10 feet from the side of their house to the curb\u2026 Anyways \u2013 he and his stoner brother were cleaning their yard (wow! Hard work) and removing these ugly railroad ties that the last loser neighbors put in there. Who could have guessed\u2026 Anyways \u2013 now I sit here \u2013 tired and yeah. Peace out for now.

However, because a night's sleep is so short, a person who takes the pill will never dream again. Knowing what you do about the functions of sleep and dreaming, what would be some advantage and drawbacks of such a pill from a personal standpoint? Would you take such a pill? My Responce: REM (Random Eye Movement), a cycle during which sleep takes place, is a major portion of our nightly sleep cycle and gives our brain the ability to rest and manifest random pictures (dreams) because it becomes stimulated by random neurons. Theoretically, the body requires a certain amount of REM sleep per night to function properly. Subjects taking part in sleep studies, when awoken during a dream, spent significantly more time in REM sleep when they fell back to sleep, making up for the time lost when they were awoken to record their dream \u2013 showing that humans do in fact require a certain amount of REM sleep. So \u2013 to function properly, humans requiring a certain amount of sleep per night, is a given. If deprived of that sleep they will be able to live their lives normally, but they will be snappy and irritable because their brain isn\u2019t rested, even though they themselves may feel rested. According to the Dreams-for-Survival Theory, \u201c\u2026dreams represent concerns about our daily lives, illustrating our uncertainties, indecisions, ideas and desires. Dreams are seen, then, as consistent with everyday living. Rather than being disguised wishes as Freud suggested, they would represent key concerns growing out of our daily experiences (\u201cEssentials of Understanding Psychology\u201d page 123) The text goes on to say, \u201cDreams permit information that is critical for our daily survival to be reconsidered and reprocessed during sleep.\u201d (\u201cEssentials of Understanding Psychology\u201d page 122) So, if a miracle pill were invented, under the influence of which we would have to only sleep one hour a night, it would cause major problems for humans. Yes \u2013 they would have much more time on their hands to do the many tasks in their life which they don\u2019t have time for \u2013 but they would be snappy to their colleagues, they wouldn\u2019t be able to \u201cpermit information that is critical for our daily survival to be reconsidered and reprocessed during sleep\u201d and their body would be constantly asking for more REM (as seen in studies of victims awoken during REM.) Due to the above stated issues, I would personally not take any kind of miracle pill that made it so I didn\u2019t have to sleep. Though I would have more time on my hands, I wouldn\u2019t feel as rested as I do with 6 or more hours of sleep (including REM, of course) and my life probably wouldn\u2019t be as fulfilling. My senses would probably also be somewhat numb after awhile. Plus dreams, in a lot of cases are interesting \u2013 especially when they are erotic dreams.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Question: If the eye were constructed with a second lens that \"unreversed\" the image hitting the retina, do you think there would be changes in the way people perceive the world? My Responce: The human eye, seeing things upside down, yet the brain reversing the image and letting us see it right side up is a very interesting human ability. According to the book we do actually see things upside down and the brain turns them right side up, however, our bodies do not work like a microscope in that there is not a second lens that turns seen images right side up \u2013 we have adapted to do it ourselves. If for some reason our bodies were to change or evolve where we acquired a second lens that turned everything we see un-reversed, there could be two outcomes. One \u2013 our bodies would see everything upside down, like the researcher who wore the glasses in England where she saw everything upside down, then after a certain amount of time our bodies would get used to the upside down image and be able to function normally, seeing the world upside down, thus we would just learn to live with the world upside down, and after awhile would know no significant difference. Or \u2013 a second outcome \u2013 our brain over time would turn things back reversed so our body functioned as it did before; although a much more possible outcome would be that the function of the brain associated with un-reversing all of our vision would simply become obsolete because it wouldn\u2019t be needed to reverse the images anymore \u2013therefore the second lens would ultimately perform that function for the brain and the brain would no longer deal with the turning/reversal of images.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "In Psychology we've been studying the states of consciousness and stages of sleep and its been really interesting.

Thats the main thing that sucks about college - the prof's dont want to be grading a bunch of writing assignments you can BS your way through - so they make most of your grade tests on scan-trons to make things easy for them, and that sucks for me because I'm not the best tester in the world... I've been dropping a lot of weight, or at least toning up the weight I do have but to get rid of the love-handles and excess fat Mrs. Macias has told me I have to start running YUCK! so I guess I will start running, but I swear I look like a girl when I run, so I need to find a place to do it where people wont see me - maybe the track at my High School after-hours or the track at the college after dance (provided there are no classes using it) so I can get completely in shape by the start of High School. Unfortunatly dance is only going to continue for two more weeks and then I'll have to be self-motivated until school starts back in the fall (Modern Dance then and then High School PE - with timed running) YUCK! So I'm going to do Pilates and then go somewhere and run on my own (Maybe do something active with my Mom - run while she bike rides so she can get some kind of health benefit from the deal) then then, like I said, continue the toning and dance supplement by doing MTV Pilates when dance is over. I hope I come out of school with a really good grade in both classes so I can continue on with cool classes and get a lot of college out of the way before I actually enter college - so I can take a whole load of the biology classes I wanna take.

The people there want to be there, they dont have to be there, most of them care because they're paying to be taught where High School their parents pay, etc. And as easy as I could just go test out of High School, get a GED and go to SWC full time (and get completely done in my early 20s) I would be ineligable for most scholarships, have to pay for super expensive student loans and there would constantly be a war with both of my parents over whose paying this and whose paying that and I would probably eventually get to the point where neither would or could pay anymore, and I would just be sitting there not going to school - working full time at a going-no-where job or be just spending like crazy and piling up my loans fees. So I guess in the end I'm staying in High School, or at least to my junior year. That would be at least one more year, probably two. Whats really great is that I have an \"A\" in Psychology right now (right at 90% average) and I probably have an \"A\" or \"B\" in Dance, which is good considering I'm barely a sophomore and I can successfully do great in high school classes.

I swear: When I first got up, after I took a nap because she was going to \"borrow\" the computer from me for a short time - three hours later, before she would give it back to me for studying (I swear she takes it away from me whenever I'm on it for her damn Avon) she made me vacuum and \"do something around the house\" cuz I haven't done anything for 'months' before she'd let me back on! Now shes walking around the house randomly screaming stuff at me, randomly telling me things to do and randomly accusing me of stuff. Right now she said I put two loads in the washer and if I ever do it again she wont let me use the washer anymore and I'll have to just wear my clothes dirty (she's done this in the past, so I dont think she's kidding) and her washer is a \"double capacity\" so I did not overload it. Right now I'm overly pissed. And I just found out this person I have a mad crush on will never work out...which makes me sad. Cuz they dont feel the same way about me. *frown* Talked to my dance teacher today about some stuff, she's apairently a more laid back super smart person too - she told me she was taking college classes at the same age as me, that she took AP classes and all that and she had some curious recomendations. She suggested that I just take AP classes to get the weighted GPA, but not worry about the tests because they're dumb, and you have a \"chace\" of passing or failing the test and not getting the credit. She said in college you actually have something to show for your efforts, like selling your text book back, etc - and that a semester is equivelant to what a year in high school gives you, meeting twice a week rather then everyday. So that sounds better to me. Tonight we went to Costco where my Mom FINALLY bought some ink cartrages (shes too cheap to buy ones for the *REAL* Dell Printer - so she settled with ones for the crappy Epson printer) and I was looking at books - thinking of the ones I'd like to buy and I found out that I'm broke (underdrawn) and my Dad is going to (figuratively) kill me when/if he finds out, so I need to get my financial dealings under control (use self-control) so this doesn't keep happening. We went to Lolitas for dinner and got the #1 (Two Tacos, Beans, Rice) and I still am really surprised how something so simple is the best thing, in my opinion, that they have there. I used to get all this wierd fancy, expensive stuff and now I found my favorite thing (Although I think I'm getting Carne Asada Fries next time - I'm due for Carb Overload.) Well - off to studying.

The first day we were there, we had gotten there around 10 (left home at 4:30 am!!) my Mom called her cousin, Cathy and later at night they came to our resort and took us to dinner. What really sucked about the dinner, is my Mom didn't know they were going to pay and we ordered this dish that was pretty expensive (and nasty) then we were all like \"oh shit!\" when it was time to go cuz they caught the bill, then my Mom offered to pay the tip and didn't put enough, realised it later, and was even more put out. The resturaunt was a very western steak place equipped with a Bull, a slide down from the bar to the dining area (piled with little kids) and some awesome bread and salad (bread rocked, BBQ sucked) and they had this cool cinnamon butter junk to go on the indian flat bread and on the biscuits which just made the dinner complete. During dinner I asked my Mother's cousin what she does for a living and she told me she used to work for Sprint as a lead over several states until she was layed off and now she is a median, she communicates with the dead, she goes into people's previous lives and removes negitive energy, she clears the constructed areas within people's energy meridians, she does accu-pressure and she does transcendual meditation. She went on to explain how she communicates with spirit guides and \"descended master\" (fancy name for a Demon...) and it really creeped me out. When she went on to say that she \"communicates wth the dead\" her voice even changed - it went down an octave. So as much as I dont really want to do the God thing anymore, I still totally believe God exists and Jesus and the whole bible thing, and definatly demons and angels - so it was really wierd. (Back to my beliefs - I just have a lot of conflicting beliefs about doctrine and stupid people within the church) Anyways, after our dinner thingie we went back to the hotel and just chilled and then went to Bed. Saturday for the most part was uneventful. We rented a car, got to take a really fancy car to the rental car place (free of charge) and then we got this piece-of-shit car that the Air Conditioner barely worked and then went to the grocery store and bought some junk along with somewhat good food and then went back to the room, took a nap, chilled, Mom cooked - etc. Then that night we went to the pool, chilled by the pool, got and then we went to the bar and got some Nachos and Pina Coladas (I bet they woulda sold me alcohol if I woulda tried since I look old, but I didn't want to chance getting arrested or my Mom finding out and me getting in big trouble with her - so I didn't try it - just went with virgin Pina Coladas - which are still good) Also on Saturday we went to this mall and saw Stepford Wives and ate some Nathans Hot Dogs. Also I went to the Virgin Megacenter place and bought a book (wanted to buy a load of CDs too) and then thought I shouldn't have bought the book cuz I'm broke so I had my Mom take it back and play along with me about how I shouldn't have bought the book and she's all disappointed and I'm in big trouble and she was able to get my money back...which was good. After that we went to a 99 cent store where I found some great books super cheap and got them for a buck each. Then we went back to the resort and did the above explained pool vs. bar thing. The next day we went to my Mom's cousin's house in this rich-snobish part of Phoenix and went in the pool and then she cooked for us and we had a truly awesome lunch. I sat around her pool and read my book \"Watership Down\". I could have been playing with her kids, but they're 6 and 10 and totally not my age and that would have been strange, so I just read. At one point they did come join me in the pool and we played some in-water basketball. The 10 year old caught the rebounds for me and the 6 year old was my cherring comitte. After that we had these huge juicy pork chops, brownie w/ ice cream, twice baked potatos, etc and it rocked. Then after that we drove 30 minutes or so back to our room and this guy Brian Agosto, an awesome guy that I grew up with way back when, came with his wife to visit us and we got to catch up with him and find out how his life is doing now and all that. Most of his conversation was about his older brother and a lot of religious stuff with he and my Mom so I didn't really get to talk to him much, but he is still really awesome. As kids his little brother and I were best friends and used to always be together, but I dont really remember his little brother much because they moved away when I was like...8 or 9. But we did, all-in-all have tons of fun together way back when, I just forget the details. Anyways- Brian is 21 now, getting formally wed in September with his wife (they had one of the \"you're legally married now says the state\" kind of weddings and then are having the wedding with all the family and stuff in September.) I remembered Brian as a really religious dude, super involved in church and stuff when we were kids and now its really awesome to see him way more laid back and stuff. He even cussed a couple of times, talked about be careful you dont sleep around in Brasil because people have a lot of STDs...etc - so that was awesome to hear/see. They took off around 11, we went to bed and then got up at like 7 to get all packed up and stuff and then take our flight home. At the airport there were these two super ugly dudes that seriously looked like terrorists and had me a little scared at one point but our flight was fine and then we got home and got a ride with Lora and then dropped off my stuff at school, grabbed my school stuff and jumped in the car. I barely got to my Psych class on time, but got there, and then we took a test (dont know how hot I did on it - had to do a bit of quessing on some of the outside-of-the-box answers) and then now here I am. Exciting weekend huh? Out-\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Well, tonight I went back to Xscape after about...6 months and it was a surprise from the beginning. To start I was talking to Linda, who couldn't get me a ride, so she said she would call Gabe to get me a ride, who called Chris Wong to get me a ride who called Linda and suggested Joel to give me a ride. So in the end Joel picked me up, which was a big surprise but was cool. Joel seems a lot less on fire then he was in the past - but you cant judge a book by its cover - so I dont know that. But he was talking about girls, political movies, etc - he didn't have that whole \"everything is about God and conservativeness\" attitude that I remember him having. But it was cool to get a ride from him, its been a long time since I've seen him. Right when we got there, he started talking so I just walked up the stairs. I guess he didn't feel compelled to hang out with me, since its not like I'm new or something. When I got upstairs, they have those little poles with the ribbons stretched from one pole to the next, like to make a line (not sure what they're called, but like they have to get into a club or something - to herd the people) leading to where you get name tags at *snort*. I saw Priscilla there, and she has really changed. I'd hate to say that she's been brainwashed...but it sure looked like it. She has turned into one of their flunkies - like I used to be (again - my perception.) She gave me a name tag, acted excited to see me (dont know if it was genuine or not) and then explained their new rule that you cant go to the bathroom after it starts (what!?) So I walked into the main room thing, saw these two girls that I went to Elementary School with that recognized me (I recognized them after they asked me if I remembered them) and then I walked in and got a seat, after hugging Linda (probably the only person there that I know for sure loves and cares about me - the rest may - but since they never kept in contact or anything - its unlikely.) I went inside and sat alone - because I had my eyes dilated today and didn't really see anyone right away that I knew (and really there wern't that many of them there.) I've concluded that they either have left (not a huge surprise) or they became middle school leaders and were there earlier and since went home. I cant picture Elias and Ishmael leaving since they have been converted from catholic to protestant and really regard Corenrstone high - so they probably became leaders or just wern't there tonight. Elias was one of the people I was closest to - but it was almost an unspoken closeness - we didn't talk that much but both seemed to enjoy each other's company. Well - Xscape now has this video at the beginning that has \"the rules\", which includes a bunch of random (illegal and pirated) video clips, a bunch of songs (someone likes Twista) and it was dumb. That new rule \"You cant go to the bathroom - no matter how bad\" is the stupidist thing I've ever heard. I understand the concept behind it - it is disruptive to the speaker to get up and go during them speaking - but its still really dumb. They sell all kinds of various foods and drinks. They're asking for people to have to go to the bathroom. Whats up with that? And what if someone was sick and needed to take a dump? I personally have a lot of stomach problems and never know when I'm gonna have to just go in a seconds notice - so that just sucks. The rules also went on to say that \"if you dont like these rules - we can escort you to the exit.\" God, if I would have been new and not known how they really are, I probably would have walked out. That is really stupid. And I bet anything I knew who came up with those rules too... Well - the video at the end had a five second count down - then there was the dramatic entrance of the worship team - which made everyone come to the front of the room and then they have no worship anymore. Everything is high paced praise. They want everything to be happy and fun I guess - but thats not reality. How is there reverance in all that praise? It was interesting that several people came over right away and said whats up to me. I mean, it didn't exactly surprise me, but it was just surprising...if that makes sense. I mean - it was real - that was surprising - but that they came over wasn't surprising. Daniel ran right over and Jennifer stopped me in the hall and said hi. She even commented on my cartilage piercing (which I think the left part is infected.) Right after worship I glanced over and saw John, Randy's (this former youth leader who really reached out to me and was thus really hurt by Cornerstone) little brother. After everything that happened with Randy (the pastor telling off his Mom over the phone) I'm really surprised to see his brother. Michael (youth leader) spoke on the prodigal son and there were several comments that other people didn't really catch that I caught. There was a comment about how people dont come to Xscape because they dont agree with how its run (so I guess I'm not the only one...or maybe that was aimed at me) and then he made another comment, toward the end, about how he's seen fired up youth leaders just...fade away over time and get lost because they try to deal with their issues on their own (which is totally me.) He forgot to add on there that Cornerstone tells you to go to them, and not God to get help with stuff. But the message was indirectly for me I guess. It was about coming bitter and stuff and turning away from God and how to know if you're backslidden or lost or what and how you can get back. Right now I'd really like to get back straight with God, but I have a couple issues. The generally uneducated-in-worldly-matters Christian community has no knowledge of science and political matters - so they automatically go with what someone tells them (classical example of brainwashing) and Christianity in general doesn't give credit to science. Two - I like my sin. Sad to say - but I'm being honest. I like my sin - I would have to give it up to God and not do it anymore if I wanted to get back straight with him. Three - I have a lot of issues with Cornerstone. I've been very hurt in the past and right now my heart it too hard and I'm to bitter to let them help me again. But tonight they did say to go to God with your problems - which I guess I can do. All they're gonna do is tell me to work my ass off for them and it will all go away - so I'm not gonna bother. Four - yeah, I haven't been going to Xscape because I dont agree with a lot of what goes on there. Those stupid rules aren't going to help that. All of their other rules were a given. Whose gonna drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes or do drugs in church (come on.) And most people aren't going to cuss because they're being someone they're not to impress the church people. If I wanted to cuss, I would cuss no matter where I am. God see's it anyways - why pretend to be someone I'm not for church people who are themselves probably doing the same thing? The thing that surprised me the most today was Richard. I was expecting him to come up to me, act all excited to see me, tell me how much he loves me, etc, etc because either he knows how I feel about him or just he knows my reasons for leaving. I don't dislike Richard in the least. I think he's an awesome guy, but in a lot of ways he's way overboard - which I dont like. And I dont agree with a lot of how he runs things - but thats his job, not mine, and his choice to make, however I am entitled to my opinions and I decide if I go there or not. But it was cool to see that he didn't come over and pretend to like me. I mean, I was trying to avoid him, but when I was leaving, he grabbed me, hugged me and then I was on my way. He didn't try to get mushy, he didn't try to talk to me - and that gave me temendous respect for Richard. I didn't really have respect for him before now. I mean he were there, I love all three of his kids, so I couldn't obviously totally dislike him - but now I have that respect. He wasn't trying to force me to be someone I'm not, to do something I dont want, etc. So even though, if possible, it got worse, I'm gonig to keep going back. I dont know if I will ever get back to where I was, or if I want to ever be a leader again - just because I have to be someone I'm not for a cause I dont believe in and be brainwashed - but I may be able to lead a dance thing. Also...very wierd - you have to have a leadership certification... The beginning \"leadership\" positions are vacuuming, operating a camera, giving out nametags, etc. What is there to be certified for? I'm guessing its some kind of brainwashing session where they tell you how much God is going to bless you for working for them. You're going to get a special place in heave, etc, etc. I was never subjected myself to that, but what else could it be? Well - I'm gonna stop bitching now. I'd like to talk to Gabe and some people there just to get an idea if they still love me or if its a game. Gabe and I used to be pretty tight and then through the time I haven't been there he's gotten pretty distant. He doesn't even answer e-mails and stuff anymore - but then they're gotten pretty more advanced then they were. They have some powerpoint like program where the background is animated (no doubt pirated - like everything else.) On last thought - its really ironic that I'd have to be certified if I was to get heavily involved again. I see the irony because I would be willing to pay that there is no one in that church more advanced then me when it comes to technology - especially computer related. They didn't even know that they could import slides from other presentations such as lyrics into one large powerpoint presentation. They had individual presentations for each song, for the message, etc - so I taught them something as basic as that. Other then graphic art and maybe video editing and possibly the hook up or sound equiptment (which is more of just the knowledge of how something is assembled rather then actual knowledge) there would be no one who knows that I know about technology, yet I would have to be oriented (certified) as well...thats pretty whacked up. -Mb\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Well - even though I've been hurt by Cornerstone a lot in the past I'm going back to their youth tonight, so face people I've burnt bridges with and then friends who I haven't heard with - I dont know if I'm like a dog going back to it's vomit or something - but maybe this will be good? I've always enjoyed Xscape in the past and I guess all I can hope for is that the people I've burnt bridges with don't hold grudges... I dont know if I have a way of getting a ride - so I may be taking the bus and then walking like 1/2 - 3/4 a mile...but oh well. I guess if all goes wrong I can just leave - I'm kinda nervous about it actually. Speaking of burnt bridges, on the way to the Optomitrist, my Dad was telling me that last night when he almost severed his finger while cutting an onion, he had to go to the ER, and then this neighbor that he'd been at it with over parking happened to be the head ER doc...man would he have been in bad shape if that doctor would have been the one who had to stitch up his finger - so I guess that tells me to be civil to people I dont like. This eye doctor I had today I wasn't too impressed with. She didn't seem to really care about her patients - she was just doing her job and doing the list of stuff they're supposed to do. I miss the other doctor I used to have, Aaron Lech. I just tried looking up an e-mail for him, but all I found was an Address and Phone number - which probably doesn't even exist anymore, since he's in the Navy and has probably been transferred to another hospital by now - plus I would seem very stalkerish if I was to call...so I guess unless he gets an e-mail thats listed, I've lost contact. What really sucks is Dr. Lech was willing to go all the way with my vision - he lied about a non-existant disease to get me free contacts and stuff from the military and I was a little kid who didn't want to be bothered back then. Now I have this conceited female civilian doctor who doesn't want to be bothered...ick. Well - yeah, off I go.

The director of this movie had no problem showing us how hunky Ryan Gosling is, in several love scenes. The main theme of this movie was two teenagers falling in love in a small North Carolina town. Allie was a rich girl living in Charleston, North Carolina who goes to a small North Carolina town on the ocean, to live in her summer house. Noah is a poor, simple (sexy!) country boy who doesn\u2019t have two nickels to rub together but wins Allie\u2019s heart through several social events. Of course, Allie\u2019s snobbish parents do not approve of someone who only makes 40 cents an hour and pull Allie and Noah apart. Once forced back to Charleston, Noah writes 365 letters to Allie, one per day of the year. Allie\u2019s mother, in Charleston, takes every one of her letters from Noah and hides them \u2013 so because of a bitter break up, figured Noah wants nothing to do with her and moves on in life. The movie was very sad in parts and had me crying more then once. But all in all was a very romantic chick-flickish movie. I would defiantly recommend it.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Just saw on the news, since Dad has it on about 24/7, that they are making power cells out of Spinach.

But the park was awesome, they had a cute black lab puppy that I wanted to take home, I actually understood a little of what was going on in the game and I got a lot of food. LOL We had a couple of wierd characters around us - this dude that's fat hung so far over his seat that I was crowded and had no leg room. I swear his fat hung a good foot over the chair and he was right in front of me. He moved a lot though - and finally because we were getting so sun burnt me and my Dad moved to the back section of where we were to get in the shade. The highlight of the game was this flag that took up most of the field and then the jets flying at mach 5 over us. Was loud - but cool. After the game we went to Applebees where I got this nasty orange chicken platter thing and my Dad got all you can eat riblets - but all he actually ate was the ribs of one helping - he didn't even touch his fries or cole slaw (that best part) but got all wierd and angered when I suggested that one order was \"more then you can eat\" and just a regular meal was cheaper - so I left him alone and let him waste his money. After we were done eating we walked around the mall a little, I found the Piercing Pagoda and then got my cartilage on both ears pierced for only $13 (including an extra bottle of ear care stuff.) Was a great deal. And I think the earrings are gold plated to prevent infection - so thats even a better plus. Although I was no in extreme pain and still am not - the cartilage hurt a lot more then the lobe (yesterday) hurt me. After the mall we came home and I replied to a load of random messages on this mailing list I'm on (http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/Any_Discussion) which lead to the inspiration to write an editorial (I dont really like it too much - it was inconsistant as a friend put it - and I'd have to agree) but heres the link if you wanna read it: http://togzone.com/nuke/modules.php?name=News=article=60==0=0 I unfortunately had to go see fireworks, which wern't too impressive, before I got to write my editorial though. We went to the building my Dad works at downtown and went to the roof to watch the fireworks and he was being all paranoid that me, his \"little baby\" was gonna go walking off the side of the building or something. I swear he treats me like I'm 5, when in all reality I'm probably more intelligant and more mature then he is in many ways. But he and this other engineer had to raise the flag and had to keep going back to the flag to try it again because right when they'd think its safe - the wind out pick up and they didn't want to get sucked up in the air. When they finally did it, I walked within 50 feet of the harmless flag pole and my Dad said if I dont go back to the way other side of the building - we were going to go home. Well - first off, since I was certainly 10 feet atleast away from any potentially dangerous part of the flag pole - he should have been all happy that I'm interested in what he does for a living. Then I started the drama - when he was done I was like \"You know - how you're threatoning me that we're gonna go home - you say that like I actually want to be here, and that is some punishment to leave - when in all reality it would be a favor\" and you could see it on his face instantly that he was pissed. Whats really interesting is that he didn't blow - and he has major anger issues - so he excercised a lottt of self control in not doing that. I guess he already is consided a bitch by his co-workers cuz he talks loud, is wierd and thinks he's all that - so he didn't want them to think he was absuse too...so basically I knew I went over the edge, got a reaction which is what I was looking for and had to give him some BS line about not meaning it so I dont get introuble and not be able to write my edtiroial when I got home. So we made up, I was miserable through the completely over-rated display of fireworks and we came home.

Should be fun. Last night I dreamt that I was in Mammoth Lakes CA on the ski resort in July and Mammoth was way smaller then it actually is, yet there were signes that said Mammoth (dont ask). I was skiing dont some last remaining snow, right along side a grassy area (I vaguely remember something about my Dad's explorer being up there with me) and I just remember a lot of grass. And then in the end, I skiied down the hill until I was in complete grass and then the dream just ended... I think we were at the top of the hill or something. I think I dreamed about this dream because I was looking at this Mammoth book my Dad had. Their monthly newspaper or something and it just caused me to reminisce about when I went skiing there. Only real definition other then it was a just a completely random dream. Only wierd thing is that the place I was in looked nothing whatsoever like Mammoth Lakes CA and there was very little actual snow + plus it wasn't cold. Then the other night I had a dream that I was laying in my living room floor at my Mom's on my phone then I woke up at 12 years old with my best friend sitting in my chair at the dining room table assembling some sort of food while my Mom was cooking it and then I looked like I did when I was 12, except internally I was 15 and then I used my cell phone - that somehow worked when it runs on completely different signals then they even had back then (but then its a dream - they're not legalistic) and I called my English teacher to see if she knew me to find out how to get home. I dont remember our specific conversation though. I guess I associate my English teacher as a very smart and very informed individual who could help me - which she probably could have. So I think that is symbolic as someone I can maybe turn to for help on life matters? And then I remember just...ending the dream. I dont remember if she knew me or anything.

Right now its really nice to not have the extra weight carrying around to have to contend with and be more hot (if I was as fat as I used to be I'd be worse off emotionally by the weather.) Both of my parents have been totally evil the last few days because of the weather and its getting annoying. Tonight my Dad got paged and was in the shower so he didn't hear his pager and when he did come out he was freaking out about it...*sigh* dont know whats up with him. Then he called work and told someone off or something. I think its humorous but sad. Today my Dad picked me up at my Mom's house and then we went to Sports Authority where I bought some resista-bands to go along with my Yoga-Pilates workout and they're really helpful. All the people at Sports Authority were evil though. I dont know if they just dont value their customers or if the heat was getting to them too (but then the place is air conditioned...so I dont think thats it.) I was gonna go to Xscape tonight and listen to Gabe speak and stuff but I concluded thats its too damn hot plus Xscape is upstairs, so that would be a really bad deal since heat rises and there are enough sweaty/hot people up there just because of the intense action and the friction as it is without it being 90 with no AC. Also today, on a better note, my check from Blurb came. I finally got my $20 and this is a really good time to get it. Also today I've been trying to recruit some people to come to BMG Music because I'm running low on free CDs and I need to replenish my stash. Ona sadder note, this dude Michael M. who I've been internet friends with for a long time kinda broke it off with me today cuz we were arguing and he was being stupid and threatoned to block me (wrong thing to do) so to show him that he has like no persuasion over me I said go ahead and block me...and he did. Kinda sad deal - but I'm sure he's gonna unblock me in time. I'm not about to apologize, cuz he was the one being stupid. He'll probably need me for something and IM me. Then I can be all hardass on him. Tonight my Dad and I went to La Bella Pizza and then got this one kinda pizza with mushrooms, onions, pepperoni and green peppers and then went to Blockbusters and he got mad in the car cuz I wanted to rent \"Mean Girls\" cuz I like Lindsay Lohan...and left blockbuster and drove home *sigh*. I guess I can blame it on this heat? Then he came home, turned on the AC and then went to bed. So I've been just up messing around. Have apsych quizon Monday so I'm gonna have to get studying sometime this weekend to be ready for it. Also talked to one of my best friends, Isaac Martinez and he's been telling me he went to UCSD for this upward bound program thingie to get high school credit and the whole under-under-grad experiance thing going and apairently he's miserable. He figured it would be all laid back and he said its constant homework. And what really sucks is that he doesn't even get college credit for it. I think it counts toward his High School GPA. And it sounds like the classes are totally accellerated, where they get a whole credit for the classes (a whole year) in 6 weeks. So its interesting nonetheless. He's also going out with this girl that I told him I liked - its not the first time he did that. I told him I like someone, he gets to know them to help me out and then I dont do anything and he ends up liking them himself and taking them. It sounds like they're pretty happy too. Movies and stuff. I guess thats cool. I'm pretty happy for him. I also told him about this one guy that asked me out at SWC (he's very naive and homo phobic) and I just said that I told him \"thanks but no thanks\" and I told him even though it was a guy it was a total compliment to be asked out cuz someone thought I was hot (if he only knew). And he went on to say that he's glad he wasn't there cuz he would have beat the guy up *rolls eyes*. I explained that that would be 1) a hate crime and 2) assault and battery. I think its sad that in this day and time with all the gay marriage and gay rights movement that he is still so conservative in terms of his homo phobicness.

She also went on to (I think this was yesterday) tell me that I should go straight on to UCSD rather then going to Community College because I'm too smart to be with the slackers and I'll probably myself get lazy at Community College. But she said if finances are a problem then go to SWC for GE stuff and lower division classes because she said Student Loans suck. Also I wrote this letter about me being her Aide and she signed that off too. Thats awesome. I can be an aide for my favorite teacher. She's gonna have to get back into bitchy mode though at the High School (she's not a bitch at all - but she has to be all tough and stuff at the High School) because theres a bunch of un-motivates little freshmen (hah! I can make fun of them now! Like I would do that... fuck conformity) and they like...will be chewing gum which they can choke on during PE and stuff. I was telling her that she should make them do some dance stuff, but apairently she's not supposed to do that. I'm hoping she'll sneak some in there because kids should be enlightened more with the arts. They should force everyone to take an artistic class. Dance, Drama or Music. They can easily opt out with Art 100 (equivelant with college). Well - our final was good I guess. Cant say the same about my Psych test though - I dont think I did too hot on that one - but maybe I did too?

Probably haven't eaten together more then 10 times. So I dont get it. But back to what I was saying, he said \"I dont agree with you having food at the computer\" so I was like \"that nice.\" And continued eating. So he was like \"do what I told you!\" and I was like \"You didn't tell me to do anything\" which is the truth, so he got all pissed, told me \"what to do\" and then I complied. End of story.

I think in the future I'm just gonna sleep in my room and roast to death - better than putting up with her crap. Also I had to listen to her tell me that I was no good, and always insult her (I pointed out, in all humility, that she used to beat me as a kid - which she denied, but got awfully defensive over) which I didn't, cuz it was true.

Whats really good though is that I can get a new start there. At Cornerstone I'm the evil sinner person, here they can see me for what I really am. Also its like a huge youth church. Most people there are between 18 and 28 according to the website. And their High School ministry looks small, so maybe I can easily become a leader again or something? I doubt any church will let you just jump up in there like Cornerstone does though. Thats unheard of. To be in leadership after like...3 weeks. Maybe it was my charm? (joke) Whats even better I think Something Like Silas leads the Worship at Flood. So maybe I can get to know the band people and then once I get to know them help them out and promote them and stuff. I've been looking for a band to do that with more directly then I do with Superchic[k], and my heart would be way more in it if the band people were friends rather then just random people who happen to sing well.

For awhile now I\u2019ve been very concerned and infuriated by illegal aliens cheating the American school system and wasting our tax dollars by coming to school, free to them, at a cost to us, in America. Illegal aliens also come to America when they are ready to give birth, hoping to have their child in the US in order to get welfare and other aid intended for American citizens. Putting a stop to this selfish unlawful occurrence would be the best choice for the American and Californian Government. On top of all the other challenges facing the American educational system, massive illegal immigration is costing the nation\u2019s schools $7.4 billion annually and has added 1.1 million students to the country\u2019s already overcrowded classrooms (Dan Stein, editorial: Massive Illegal Immigration is Crippling America\u2019s Schools, September 15, 2003.) Living on the border, in California, a border state, I see firsthand on a daily the effects of having a school largely populated by illegal Mexican immigrants has on the California economy. We get new textbooks only every seven years because of budget cuts, are discouraged from using air conditioning unless it is unbearably hot (in schools that actually have air conditioning) because of budget cuts, have outdated technological equipment and generally go without in science labs because of budget cuts. This is but a small list of things we go without due in large part to illegal immigrants. The perks that we get in school usually come from the occasional grant and not the California school system. However, this problem would be greatly reduced if a method of preventing illegal aliens from attending American schools without paying tuition was instituted. In California, which has the greatest number of illegal aliens in its schools and, not coincidentally, a budget deficit as large as the other 49 states combined, the $2.2 billion now devoted to educating illegal immigrants could be spent hiring an additional 41,764 teachers, or adding enough new schools so that no child in the state is sitting in an overcrowded classroom (Dan Stein, article: Massive Illegal Immigration is Crippling America\u2019s Schools, September 15, 2003.) Some would say that I sound selfish, others would say heartless, and still others would say I don\u2019t know what its like to not have all the benefits that I have as an American. And they\u2019re right, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. But the opportunities in America are just that, for Americans. Not everyone else in the world who doesn\u2019t want to earn what we, as Americans, have. America didn\u2019t just appear and end up this way. It would be different if the illegals became citizens, but they don\u2019t want to give back to America or have any responsibility (like paying taxes that go toward schools) that Americans have. They just want the perks Americans have earned, without being an American. Debating this issue with others at my school I\u2019ve been informed that \u201ceducation is not free in Mexico\u201d and I\u2019ve tried to explain that it isn\u2019t free in America either. Yet most Mexicans and even many misinformed Americans have the misconception that it is free here. Yes I agree its unfortunate that they do not have education provided by the state in Mexico, but why should American citizens have to go without? How is it our problem that education is not provided in Mexico? This brings me onto another topic, illegal Mexican immigrants crossing the border shortly before they are due to give birth to their child. In many cases the pregnant woman has no idea who the father of her child even is and happens to be so poor that she doesn\u2019t feel she can support her baby in Mexico, so she comes to America to have her child and make her \u201cAmerican\u201d child the responsibility of a government which she does not claim belonging. This is another way American tax dollars are wasted on illegal immigrants. Also keep in mind, welfare breeds\u2019 welfare. Any illegal immigrant turned temporary resident\u2019s children will think the same way they do. \u201cI have no allegiance to this country anyways, so why not get everything I can free from it, I can always run to Mexico if something goes wrong.\u201d That is exactly the mentality they have; I\u2019ve heard just that, repeated numerous times. There are approximately 8 million undocumented immigrants in the United States; 2.5 million reside in California. The costs of providing social services to these individuals and incarcerating illegal immigrants is staggering - easily exceeding $3 billion a year (Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s undocumented immigrant agenda, http://www.joinarnold.com/en/agenda/#E1.) Immigration is a national responsibility and California should not be left to shoulder the massive burden of providing public services to illegal immigrants. If an immigrant does not want to be become a citizen they shouldn\u2019t be allowed here unless they have a visa granted for a certain period, to visit. Amazingly, even with the knowledge of the above stated statistics, very little has been done in prevention. However, one of the most significant efforts within California was that in 1994 by Gene Garman. Garman proposed that California work off of a school voucher system where legal residents of California with social security numbers receive annual school vouchers usable at either a private institution or a public school. This would have made it where residents could go to either type of school and it would have prevented illegal undocumented immigrants from lying about their addresses, because regardless of their \u201ccousin\u2019s\u201d address: no social security number, no American school. It\u2019s as simple as that. However, the teachers and public school district officials were very concerned that if children had the choice of going to private schools over public schools with school vouchers, they would be unemployed because no child in their right mind would chose a public school over a private, so the proposed bill for school vouchers was pushed out. The school districts in California try to put a stop to illegal aliens going to our schools, but in all realization they really just make it harder for residents to go to school. Illegal immigrants simply use a relative\u2019s address, lying about having residence and their children go to American schools, undermining the entire purpose of residency verification. I have various friends that brag about how many school documents come to their houses when school is starting and how many report cards come to their house at the end of a semester, addressed to their various distant relations. They think it\u2019s a cool thing that they are getting over on the American Government and getting something for free, at our expense. Rumor has it that Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California is in the works of passing a law where there will be a certain amount of time for all illegal residents of California to apply for citizenship and then all whom are denied citizenship (or who never sought citizenship) would be deported if over the set amount of time. Though, I have not been able to confirm the validity of this rumor. However, I think this \u201crumor\u201d easily and without question would be the best-case scenario for California. To have a closed border after a set period of time, where, after the border is closed, all non US residents would have to have a visa for a temporary visit in order to cross the border. Closing the border to illegal children going to American schools and preventing illegal adults from giving birth in the US would save California billions of dollars and it would make our schools much better in the long run. He would have supplementary current text books, less crowded classrooms, schools that speak primarily one language, newer technological equipment, more athletic resources, more of a budget for clubs and much more. Schools would be better for everyone. Most Californian schools have bilingual classrooms, a sure sign, if someone doesn\u2019t even know the language, that they don\u2019t live here. Our taxpayers\u2019 dollars knowingly go to educating illegals. What is wrong with this picture? If an American was to go to France or Germany (or gasp Mexico) you can sure as hell bet they wouldn\u2019t be educated in English rather than the county\u2019s native language. On closing, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a classic example of an immigrant who became a citizen. He came here from Western Europe, knowing little to no English and probably very little about America, yet he tried and worked tirelessly to become a citizen. Look where he is now. He is a very popular actor, who has won multiple awards and has recently become governor of California. If he can do it, any other immigrant can do it; they just have to expend a little effort. If they were to become citizens, and were giving back to the California economy we would be much better off and have much more of a budget not just as a state, but also as a country. Note: Wanted to clarify, that though I'm still moderatly against illegal residents living in the state of California, someone living here (a resident) has every right to go to American schools. They are a resident after all. My comments on illegal immigrants not going to American schools was in terms of those who come over the border in the morning, go to American schools, use a \"cousins'\" address and then go back over the border at night. And on another note, although this article seemingly targets only Mexican immigrants, it applies to any other immigrant too. The problem in Southern California, obviously since we're on the border, is Mexican immigration.

America as a whole is a wealthier country than Mexico or most countries that bring in a lot of illegal aliens... and as a Christian, we should be willing to sacrfice things to help others. I challenge you to look at this from a Christian perspective, and remember that Christ requires us to put others before ourselves. What makes you think that just because you were born in a wealthier nation, you deserve to have a better education than the less fortunate? You being born in another country doesnt make you any better or any more deserving than anyone else. Think about this... what if you were one of them? All you want is the best for your child, a strong education and for them to live in a place where they have more opportunity than if they were in their home country. My opinion, you need to stop thinking about yourself and think about others. That's what Christ would have done. So what? Some of your tax dollars go to those who are less fortunate... think of it as saving a life rather than a waste of money. You are sharing with those less fortunate. Don't be self-centered... Jesus had every right not to die for us, it was unfair of him. But he managed to show his love for dying for us. You should extend the same kind of love for others. Afterall, Jesus was a Jew and could have only saved the Jews... after all they were HIS people, and he could have wanted only the best for his nation... he could have said, \"Only the Jews deserve salvation because only they pay taxes to the Jewish government.\" Thank goodness he didn't say that, huh?\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Today was definitely interesting to say the least. I slept in till about 12:00 pm because I was up so late the night before (and am up really late right now) and then went on the computer for about an hour and worked on my site, togzone.com \u2013 I installed a bunch of new stuff, answered some of the topics on the forum and wrote an article for it. Then I worked around the house, cleaned up cat poop, scrubbed the ceiling and cleaned my bathroom (all shiny and pretty now). When my Mom got home I was just finishing up cleaning my bathroom, jumped in the shower and then we went to see \u201cThe Village\u201d. My review of \"The Village\" Mysterious from the beginning, the Village was a very unique and interesting movie. It showcases a valley \u201cvillage\u201d surrounded by a forest and isolated from \u201cthe towns\u2019 with happy residents virtually free for any sort of crime and evil. Written by M. Night Shyamalan, The Village stars Joaquin Phoenix (Mel Gibson\u2019s Brother in Signs), Adrien Brody, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver and is categorized as \u201cDrama, Romance, Science Fiction/Fantasy and Thriller\u201d by Yahoo! Movies . The villagers stay inside of their village and \u201cthose whom we do not speak of\u201d stay in their forest. Until something changes (or does it), the villagers and creatures kept to themselves, in peace. According to one of them main characters, \u201cthose of whom we do not speak, have not been inside the village boundaries in many years.\u201d From the beginning of the movie, a series of odd events happen. Two young women are playfully sweeping their porch until they see a red flower that they promptly bury. Later in the movie, Adrien Brody\u2019s character acquired some red berries that are also promptly buried, implying that something is strange about the color red. What does it do to \u201cthose whom we do not speak of\u201d? The color yellow also seems to be conspicuous. People of the village, at times, wear druid looking robes the color yellow. Also, along the boundary of the village, the torches used to ward off \u201cthe creatures\u201d have yellow banners draped on them. What anxiety does the color yellow cause? M. Night Shyamalan put a lot of deep thought into this movie, many elements of suspense and some very twisted thinking, however the movie gives away the twist (and the climax) way too early. The viewer knows what is going to happen and the plot gets boring for about 20 minutes. Shyamalan would have been better off to hold off the twist, as in Signs, until the end of the movie. I wouldn\u2019t rate this movie as an excellent movie, however nor is the movie in by any means a bad movie. It is just a very strange movie, one that is not good or bad. I do, however, feel the movie is a very deep movie, with quite a few messages about the nature of man and what anxiety can cause man to do to stop it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who doesn\u2019t frighten easily, as The Village is a very suspenseful movie, however by no means a \u201chorror\u201d movie. Just a tip: plug your ears when suspenseful scenes come on. The music gets VERY loud. All in all I was disappointed with this movie. I\u2019ve been anticipating seeing the movie since I saw a teaser trailer beck in December and once it was over\u2026I was very disappointed. Some well written movie review quotes from users of Yahoo! Movies : From user drudashoe913 (their review: urlLink Click Here ) You will get a great storyline, absolutely amazing acting and characters (probably the best part about the movie, I think some of the acting could possibly be Oscar-worthy!!), some real scares (I almost jumped out of my seat a couple of times), and an ending that will leave you feeling utterly dissapointed. Remeber the phrase, \"What seems too good to be true, probably is.\" From user ademptious18 (their review: urlLink Click Here ) Further, I was shocked that Shyamalan would have so much political commentary in the movie. First of all, the leader, who is trying to freak out all the people as a power ploy, conventiently has the name \"Walker\" (Funny story, thats Bush's middle name and is a subtle commentary on Bush's policy with the war on terror). Further, the warning colors around the town are the same code yellow that we are on, and the bad color, the warning color, is of course red. I won't continue and ruin the story, but Shyamalan could have made the movie far better by focusing on delivering a worthy scare than on political commentary. After seeing \"The Village\" I came to my Dads and then we ordered a pizza, I worked on TogZone a lot more and made a bunch of new changes and a bunch of additions and then talked to my friend Carrie for a long time. Nothing that interesting today. Mom has actually been letting me on the computer though. Which is big improvement from how she usually is. And also we're going on this \"drive up the coast\" vacation thing where we're driving along the coast all the way up to the Bay Area. And then back down. Should be interesting being in the car with my Mom 9 hours each way. Also: this dude from Cornerstone instant messaged me because of one of my Xscape ranting and ravings where I insulted him. I was totally sorry about it...look what ranting and raving can do to you. So I edited the insult (that wasn't directly to him, but stll taken as an insult) and now that he loves me again, we're gonna go to the movies next week and see The Bourne Supremacy! Yay! Yesterday I went to my Aunt's house (not really my aunt, but a really good family friend) and I hung out with Beth, best friend/cousin (again, not blood cousin) and we hung out.

She called me, Rebecca and this other girl (forgot her name) up to the front of the room and she told us that we have the highest grades in the class and it would be wrong to place us in a group because it would be unfair (we know all the answers so our groups would basically have an un-fair advantage) and then we played \"Rocha Jeopardy\" (the teacher is Ms. Rocha - hence Rocha Jeopardy.) Well, we decided that I was going to be the caller-outter person (when they raise their numbers in the air signalling that they have an answer to the question on the screen, I write down their numbers in order) with Rebecca as the score keeper and the other girl as the right/wrong answer teller. We were a good team but I had the hardest job because they were screaming at me and harassing me if they felt I wasn't calling their numbers. The last question is the one who really determined who won though. It was worth 50 points. So it killed the people who got it wrong and really helped the people who got it right (only two people got it right - one was already winning.) What was really cool is that because I was a helper person who was running the game I automatically got 25 free points (the equivelant of what first place was). That makes it where I really dont even have to study for the final for tomorrow because it shouldn't hurt me even if I do terrible. Before the class started I was looking at the grade sheet and I had a 103% and then the 25 points I got today probably put me at 107% or 109%. Maybe not that high, but it was pretty high.

My review: A thriller about the end of the world, Black ties in a lot of elements for a good book. It seems also to have indirect religious messages tied into the story, that would go over many people\u2019s heads, but as a Christian I got them right away. The book starts out where the main character, Thomas Hunter is being chased around an alley in Denver by loan sharks. One of the loan sharks shoots him in the head and it only makes a dent on his skull without actually hurting his brain. After taking the blow he starts to have these \u201cdreams\u201d of another world. One way in the future. And he learns that in 2010 there is a virus that wipes out everyone. Well, in his alternate reality or non-dream it is 2010, so the fight is on to stop this virus from being released. Throughout the book, when Tom falls asleep in one reality he wakes up in the other reality, but the realities have no time correlation between each other. He could be in one reality for 15 years and then wake up in the other one and he was only asleep for 30 minutes. I would recommend this book. Its not the best, and the end was disappointing (since it is a trilogy and the author wants to keep you reading) but all in all it was a fun book. It kept me turning the pages and I was able to finish it in two days. That\u2019s pretty quick for a 400 page book while also in school. That tells you how exciting it was. Well psychology was good today. This was our last day of actual instruction today. We went over psychological diseases and disfunctions such as bi-polar, syhizophrenia and depression. It was really interesting all things considered. And I got to see the cool people in my class again. Thank God for them. I would be losing my mind if I had to sit through the section 5 Psychology 101 class...really really would. Those people in there...geez.

Today I got my grade for psychology. I am sitting at 94% before she added the extra credit. Today I got to drop a test that I didn't do too hot on and then I got to also apply my 25 points for perfect attendance. So that should get me back up to like 97% or maybe higher.

I'll read it again if I have to.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "-Hello AP English, this is Ryan Elliott and I'm a rookie to Blogger.com. I recall reading Night freshman year in Mrs. Micheel's English class, and the impression the story left on me brings to mind the narratives of Fredderick Douglas and Harriet Jacobs. The accounts of the Holocaust enable the reader to experience the horror firsthand, and each individual number in the death totals suddenly forms a face. At the beginning of the year I remember Mrs. VA stressing the importance of showing and not telling in writing, and I feel in many cases that history can tell a story, but it takes a first person account like Night or the narratives of Douglas and Jacobs to show the reader a story and make them live it. Considering the current study of World War II in AP History, I think Night would be an excellent compliment. The present study of World War II with Ms. Clark has made me feel disappointed in American diplomacy because of the decision to drop atom bombs on two Japanese cities. When encountering the situation, I pretended I was a soldier in WWII, and I tried to think of how I would have felt about our actions. Not only am I shocked at the civilian aimed tactics implemented globally during the war, but also I am troubled by America's decision to take part. Personally, I would have difficulty enlisting in the military because of the possibility that I could be asked to carry out a mission like the one presented to Paul Tibbets, the pilot of the Enola Gay. I believe war is a conflict between armed military soldiers, and does not involve intentional civilian casualties. In today's military this death count is accounted for by the term collateral damage, which masks its true definition probably for the morale of soldiers and the maintenance public relations. I can't imagine I would feel at peace pledging allegiance to a nation who was engaging in civilian warfare. I love my country and would no doubt serve if conscripted; however, I feel the line in the pledge of allegiance, \"with liberty and justice for all\" extends to all people of the world, and that the American bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were injustices to the Japanese people. I believe pledging allegiance to the United States of America means promising one's devotion to preserve the liberty and justice of our nation while attempting to extend the basic courtesies to all who we come in contact with. The invisible borders separating the people of the world are self created illusions, much like the concept of racial differences, that do nothing to obscure the sanctity of democratic rights or our responsibility to uphold them.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "YES I'M VERY MUCH INTERESTED! To me, historical literature are especially fun to read, especially when it compliments with what we are studying in history. And the holocaust is certainly a dramatic period of history and literture that would sprout out many ideas about morality, wars, politics and the whole theme of race and injustices. I may not be able to speak for the whole class, but it's certainly a great topic to discuss and read about! I'm sure Tristan would be interested in it too! :) And well, since Rob, you've started the pledge of allegiance debate, I have already posted a huge long post about the pledge in the history blog, but I think it's relevant for me to post my argument on this blog too because it touches on the issue of individualism and what is to be an American (the whole themes we've studied all year). And don't blame me for writing about this thing for so long, but it is inevitable. Of course everyone knows that the 1st Amendments guarantees \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.......\". And then one can debate FOREVER what does that mean, either pro pledge of allegiance, the under God phrase, or opposes it. Either way, both sides can site the constitution to argue for their sides. LOL that's the beauty of our first amendment, even tho it may be concise, it's still very interpretative. And the society is sooooooooo complex that a few words in the constitution can be argued forever into future generations. As a former buddhist, and currently agnostic, to me personally, the \"Under God\" phrase doesn't offend me. But the act of conforming is. I have nothing against people saying or chanting Under God at anytime, anywhere, or under any occassion; the constitution guarantees their rights to do so. The thing that bothers me is the act of telling others what to do or not to do. How does that relate to the pledge of allegiance is the fact that little kid six years old have to say the pledge of allegiance. And did you know all the MEANING of the words in the pledge of allegiance when you were six? To me it's almost ridiculous to impose others to say what they don't even know what they are saying, and what it means......let alone believes in it. So the little kids just memorize the phrase and spew it out like robots. And that's not what America is all about..... What makes America great and the beauty of this country is the fact that it's a country of immigrants, and EVERBODY is different, and the constitution really protects the DIFFERENCE of all individuals. In fact, individualism is not only protected, but glorified and encouraged all throughout American literature from the declaration of independence and onwards. And from individualism comes with it, differences of ideas, clash of cultures, criticisms, and sometimes stuff that people don't want to hear. What bothers me is when people stop wanting to hear complaints and other points of views. Any criticism, or other radical ideas becomes BAD and immediately shuts off from debates........And everybody has to praise everybody, praise the government, praise all the institutions, all the ideas and so on. And even if you don't, you are somehow peer pressured, or forced to comply with the \"majority\" point of view. Some of America's greatest writers were critics of the time, and often deemed radicals because of their foiling of the truth......truth that the majority didn't want to admit. Like Mark Twain's Huck Finn realism style writing that foils the true life of the South from a common southern white orphan boy's point of view. (Of course it's not just happy little child pacifer literature that's all happy and good. Because the society isn't always that good). Seriously think about, what a society would be like if everyone is the same, think the same way, and all are happy with each other with no reason. Everybody would just lose their personality and the society itself will become dumber. And education is really when the clash between conformity and individualism occurs. In order to preserve the individualisms as America's embodiment, I believe that in schools, since it's a public place, the state or government should have no say in what the kids should say. The kids are just kids, they are learning and developing.........And wheh pledge of allegiance is inserted to thehir curriculum since their first day in school.....And have memorize something they don't even know what it is......it totally defeats the American character. Education is to develop people to become individuals, to become smart citizens with an critical eye, and not to turn everybody into robotic conformists. And as always, I welcome all dissagreements, criticisms, opinions and would like to debate this issue with others. Differences of opinions is good! Thomas Chen\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Hmmm...I'm starting to think ahead to curriculum after spring break, when we will have time to read another book and also to prepare for the AP exam. I know from talking with Miss Clark that her classes have recently been spending time studying the Holocaust, and I'm thinking about Kailie's expression of frustration. Why didn't Jim just run? A similar question is often, \"Why didn't the Jews just band together and keep the Nazis from treating them so poorly.\" I'm wondering...are you folks interested in reading a first-hand account of Auschwitz after break? The book I'm thinking of is Night, written beautifully by Elie Wiesel. It's a quick read, but it's also a hard read because of the subject matter. It isn't American lit (Wiesel was Romanian, I believe), but that doesn't really matter for the test. What do you all think? Would it be best to be presented with a variety of options before deciding? As for your question about the Pledge of Allegiance, Rob...I find myself asking many more questions in addition to the one about the \"under God\" phrase. For example, what does it mean to pledge allegiance to a flag at a time when patriotism is so integrated with war-making? I cannot help but remember photos I've seen of Nazi swastika flags hanging over church altars during World War II. As a religious person, I want to see a full separation of church and state so that I am left to practice my faith as I see fit. I believe others have that right, too. Although I believe that we exist by the grace of God, not everyone does. So what does our flag stand for? When we pledge allegiance to it, what are we promising to do or not do? What is the role of God in a pluralistic country? What binds us together as a people, particularly as we become a more diverse society every year? Does pledging allegiance mean committing ourselves to creative peace-making, or only that we will pick up arms if attacked? And what about \"justice for all\"? These are the questions I ask myself every day at the beginning of third period. What do you all think? Mrs. V-A\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "First of all, let me start off by saying that I have no problem with mandatory repetition of the Pledge of Allegiance because it stands for becoming INDIVISIBLE in an effort against conformity...promotes LIBERTY- the liberty to think, act, and live without government intervention...as well as JUSTICE FOR ALL- the permission for everyone to live as they please. It may be ironic that there is a uniform method of promoting the liberties that lead to diversity, but if everyone is made different through the same process, are they not still different? I recognize the recitation of the Pledge alludes to military service as flags are used to determine a soldier's allegiance in war, but I also believe that the Pledge is more effective with a visual aid. The debate today is whether or not \"under GOD\" should or even COULD be allowed to stay in the Pledge. I outlined the current particulars of today's case in a previous post, if you haven't read them. To me, this is a case defining the separation of church and state. Although this country was outlined around that seperation, there is nothing that states that government can't recognize the ideology of monotheism, or other belief structure, as long as it doesn't allow the government of religion to directly affect it. One could argue that excluding the possibility of a deity's existence would be not seperating the state from atheist ideology. Tom C addressed free speach...that each American has the right to say what they want and worship as they please. With compliments to that right, many Americans feel the direct connection between Providence and the success of this country, and that excluding their right to express His influence in relation to the country would antithesize their beliefs. The same issue is currently being presented in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, as an Atheist man argues that with each (socially) mandatory oration of the Pledge, his daughter is taught that her father's beliefs are the wrong ones. As for me, I believe that eliminating it from the Pledge restricts the large portion of Americans who recognize the Glory of God as parallel with the liberties of this country. For those who are polytheistic, \"under god\" can be translated as recognizing a \"higher power\" than is visible in daily life. Lastly, for those that don't recognize any supernatural force or deity, \"under God\" may be substituted with a respectful pause while those who do choose to recognize God do so. My views have been presented, but I'm all about becoming as educated as I can on the attitudes toward the aspects of life that effect the way we live every day... so school me! If \"Night\" is a good read, then I'm all for it...especially if it's short! Also, are Rip Van Winkle, The Grapes of Wrath, or The Catcher in the Rye worth reading over break?

Jim, as a slave, probably has a really low self-esteem and he comes from the world where slaves have to listen to whites for every little nuts and bolts. Of course Jim did not know he was free, (any slave would think it's a miracle if somebody proclaimed they were free). So he just thought \"this is the way everything is done, because Tom said so\". Even though he has the brain to mention it's a ridiculous idea like making up a coat of arm, but he still follows the order, because who knows what will happen to him if a slave doesnt obey a white man's order. But I understand where you come from.

Not until the end of the book did Huck ever truly try to find Jim. However at the end of the book Huck's love for Jim became more prevelant. Although Huck knew better than to do all the crazy things that Tom insisted they do in order to free Jim, somehow Huck's love for Jim was submissive to Tom's influence over Huck. After trying so hard to escape to freedom then putting up with Tom's ideas of freeing a slave, Jim was still willing to risk it all for the sake of saving Tom. This is what a true hero is. Huck didn't have anything to lose, if people found out he had been trying to free a slave they would send him back to the widow's house and people would just think \"that poor boy needs to be civilized.\" However for Jim, he had everything to lose, and he was willing to lose everything for Tom, who wasn't even a true friend to Jim.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "While both Huck and Jim can be seen as heroes, Jim is the more siginificant hero of the two because of not only the racism he faces by being a slave, but because he can overcome this racism by saving Tom in the end of the book.

Anyway, addressing Tom's point from the essay that Twain was writing for a racist audience doesn't sit well with me. I'm not disagreeing that there were (and still are) many racists in this country, and probably some of them were fans of the original, Tom Sawyer, but I just don't get the feeling Twain wrote for an audience. He was already a very successful author who had stopped needing to write for money, so I don't think the bottom line was his issue. Every example of Twain's writing I've come across challenges cultural norms. Whether addressing Christianity, poverty, or racism, he attacks each issue with the underestimated weapon of satire. Flooding the tongue-in-cheek essays and novels with his own opinions, no matter how controversial. I don't believe that Twain could be writing for a racist audience while openly attacking the Ku Klux Klan, and the entire establishment of Christianity. If Twain avoided openly expressing Huck's love for Jim to the world, it was to get around his own nagging imperfections in his relations with blacks. I don't believe that this was as much of a concious effort as Miss Morison claims. Sometimes things are better off left to the imagination, e.g. the \"humbles himself to a nigger\" sentence is much more effective in my eyes than, \"I'm sorry Jim, I didn't mean to worry you.\" Lastly, although Morison's essay was very well articulated and worthy of consideration, it was very much speculation, just as I am writing now.

Wow what an interesting class that is......For some odd reason, they are forming an international collaborative English class. urlLink Wargo's AP English Junior English Class Blog\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Well our blog community now has 16 members: Beck Nelson, Thomas Chen, Forrest Vines, Chad Wyszinski, Kailie Middleton, Alexandra McDougall, Ryan Vasbinder, Corey Furin, Paul Fleurdelys, Nova Martin, Erin Riley, Kimber Graef, Megan Valencia, Tyson Cecka, Matt Goosen, and Bethany Graef.

I'm surprised at our third period class today, we actually did some genuine discussions! Without more than five minutes of silent stares at each other! That's a huge benchmark for us. LOL. Ok Nova, we may have a different stance on this issue about the discussion of \"racism\". I think the controversy of it is really really interesting, and really relevant to the society we live in today. Maybe whining about it doesn't help, and only makes the matter worse. But one has to study the history behind racism, the history behind slavery, and study the current society in general to get all these controversies and see that these debates are very interesting. If we are living in a place like Chicago, Los Angeles, NYC, San Francisco, or Atlanta, we might see the issue and controversies surrounding the issues of race and racism in a very different way, because the societies of these urban centers are so polygot that you CANNOT ignore the issue of race at all. And it becomes so relevant to your everyday lives, whether you like it or not. So I don't think we can make a judgement on how the issue of \"racism\" is sooooo out of date and dumb now. To a lot of people, it's very relevant to their lives. And reading this book Huck Finn I'm sure will help us understand better the deep history behind slavery, race relationships between whites and blacks, that still influences our thinkings today. And I agree with today's discussion just banning the N word will not solve any any racial problem at all, not even down to the scale of molecules. There are a lot of other forms of racial discriminatory actions that we can not ban because of free speech issue such as Erin's description of all the confederate flags in the south still. And for christ's sake it's a piece of literature, one of the best pieces of American lit every written. And to the issue of calling people \"whites\", \"blacks\", \"African Americans\" whatever, I agree with the discussions today that it's a matter of respect. Some people maybe offended by calling \"black\", others maybe \"African Americans\", so it. But I agree that in general, we just have to see all people as one group of Americans, and not place any body into a race or cultural profile. --------- So, what do you think of that?\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "The entire racism argument makes me mad. Do people not get that Twain was anti-racist? That he was trying to make a statement with Huck Finn? And also, the \"n-word\" was used back then, and it was the common word for black people. Making all the poor white people of the south talk in a more socially polite way would have been defeating a major point of the book, realism. 100 years from now, what if \"black\" is not politically correct? Will they ban all the books written in present day, to censor \"bad words\"? These people make me so mad!!!\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I think the people who are against this book for its portrayl of blacks need to look at how it shows whites.

I read this particular interesting thing in the passage that implied you need to be a \"good teacher\" , to actually use all the positive aspects of Huck Finn and teach more about the truth of slavery. One needs to teach Huck Finn in conjuction to the historical period behind it. An \"insensitive teacher\" may allow the racial impacts the word has on the students in the classroom goes unchecked, and allow students to \"read aloud\" in the classrooms. But \"on the contrary, studies have shown that, in the hands of a good teacher, the novel can actually have a positive impact on racial attitudes and increase in interracial understanding. I agree with the fact that if you don't see the true picture of that period in history, to see the life of a \"common man\", and use the language they use back then, one can not grasp a true concept of. And of course all of this have to be carefully studied in conjuction to a great understanding of the history of slavery and slave trading. That's why having the book in elementary and middle school is probably not a good idea. Because the kids then can't get ironies, satires, and the historical behind why Twain wrote this book and used the bad words to portrait the truth.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Well, I would have gotten the first question right...

I really like this test because of the fact that a lot of the experts that they give for analysis are actually really interesting to interpret and are great works of literature: Virtue George Herbert (1593-1633) Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright, The bridal of the earth and sky; The dew shall weep thy fall tonight; For thou must dies. Sweet rose, whose hue, angry and brave, Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye: Thy root is ever in its grave, And thou must die. Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses, A box where sweets compacted lie; My music shows ye have your closes, And all must die. Only a sweet and virtuous soul, Like seasoned timber, never gives; But though the whole world turn to coal, Then chiefly lives. Just a couple of questions for practice:) The subject of the poem is: a) mortality, b) immortality, c) the beauty of nature, d) the impact of evil, e) the essence of goodness. The speaker conceives of the world as: a) ending in ashes, b) repeating the cycle of birth and death, c) having the strength of \"seasoned timber,\" d) eternal, e) being the secure dwelling of humanity I am looking forward to frisbee tomorrow; I have to agree with Frank that sometimes it is just better to simply relax and take your mind off all the fidgeting and worries. By the way the answers to the questions are: e and c.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "All this death and gloom over the AP test, we all need some happiness... Well, okay, i'm no good at being happy, so here is some dark sarcasm. Good enough? Bush To Iraqi Militants: 'Please Stop Bringing It On' WASHINGTON, DC\u2014In an internationally televised statement Monday, President Bush modified a July 2003 challenge to Iraqi militants attacking U.S. forces. \"Terrorists, Saddam loyalists, and anti-American insurgents: Please stop bringing it on now,\" Bush said at a Monday press conference. \"Nine months and 500 U.S. casualties ago, I may have invited y'all to bring it on, but as of today, I formally rescind that statement. I would officially like for you to step back.\" The president added that the \"it\" Iraqis should stop bringing includes gunfire, bombings, grenade attacks, and suicide missions of all types.

But you are more prepared than you think. By now we can all write 9-caliber essays with the right inspiration, and the multiple choice is less perilous than you give it credit for. The tests we've taken from the books are meant to trick you- beat you on a technicality and so forth. So much so that the objective (I hope) is to get you to read the questions so closely, you don't get fooled on the test. However, there is evidence for hope. The test that I gave a link to in my last post, was a sample test written by the college board... after a 50% on the Peterson's test, I got an 80% on the real one... that's a huge improvement. It's also great for confidence. We can do this, class!!! The best advice I can give is to know the literary terms like the back of your hand... what they are, how they're used, and how you can recognize them in a passage. That's the heart of these questions, and if you can identify those terms, you will have success. Love, Rob\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "My only suggestion to those who want to \"study\" for AP English test is to take as many practice multiple choice questions as possible, and after you took a couple hundred of them you will probably see some patterns emerge; at least that's what I am planning on doing for the next 5 days. The only problem that I see is that all the practice tests written either by Petersons or Barrons are much harder and some of the questions are totally different from those on the actual AP test, so if you take their practice tests you will probably get used to those author's patterns of thinking and the type of questions they ask and what answers they are looking for, yet it's still a good practice: it helps you to try and think like the writer of the questions and also pace yourself. Last year I was taking practice world history tests and so at the AP test all the questions seemed much easier to answer and I answered all of them in time. I have to agree though with Thomas that AP English is hard becuase of its subjective questions, I am myself almost never 100% sure on answers, and often those that I was sure of end up being wrong. But I agree with Eren also that essays make up for the harsheness of mult. choice; especially after Mrs. VA gave us the rubric it became much clearer to me what exactly I should focus on including in my essays. So just practice a few more hundred mult. choice questions;), and review grammar and literary terms. My favorite questions on our last practice test: 26. What is the meaning of the word \"object\" (line 85)? a) Feel b) Dispute c) Argue d) Silence e) Save I think Rob was the one to point out the fact that \"dispute\" and \"argue\" are too similar to see that much of a difference between the two.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "To be perfectly honest, i dont really see how you can study for the AP test. I mean, of course you can review grammar and rhetorical strategies and how they effect one's writing, but i dont think it's worth getting overly stressed.

For me, I'm planning on going in on Monday with what I know...that's all we really can do. You know what you know, and as long as you try your best, that's all you can do. So dont stress out too bad. Just think, by noon on Monday, it will all be over! Kailie\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I have to disagree Thomas. The AP English test is definitely tough, but I don't think its the toughest. While a lot of the multiple choice questions are subjective, the essays make up for it. If you write good strong essays and support your points, you should (hopefully!) do well. I think people just find the test to be hard because its not something you can memorize out of a book; its skills for recognizing rhetorical strategies and writing well that count.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Ok maybe it's just me, but I would rank AP English tests the hardest tests. The multiple choice questions on the AP English tests are harder than SAT passages (which i already did horribily), not only are we suppose to know the meanings of the passage, but exactly and thoroughly understand how authors wrote it and carefully constructed the passages. There are several reasons for this ranking that puts English on the APEX of all AP tests: 1: The questions are the most subjective: Everytime when I take the AP English multiple choice tests, for every MC, I feel my hands sweat and my mind full of doubt when I bubble in an answer for that question. There is NEVER a single question that I can feel 100% confident on that I'm sure I got it right. Unlike all other subjects, including US history, where there is just some straightfoward concrete fact that's either right or wrong. The meaning of every excerpt, sentence, even to the every word of the question can be interpreted in a variety of different ways. And as Chad mentioned today in class, that we are taught so much about how to infer, imply, that we sometimes forget the LITERAL MEANINGS, and we lose perspectives. In short, every question we can \"Overthink\" it. And again being the subject of English, there is no fine line as to where is \"overthinking\", and where is \"underthinking\". To a point, it gets to be rather annoying, all the shakiness and uncertaintiness in answer EVERY SINGLE QUESTION. 2: When you get an answer wrong, and you read the explanations that explains why, you are never ever 100% convinced. There is always that self-righteous factor that comes to play that doubts the correct answers, simply because words and phrases can be interpreted differently in everybody's minds. Everytime I feel the urge to argue with whoever thought the right answer to a question is this letter, while two other letter of answers can probably be interpreted as correct. 3: For almost every other school subject, the teacher, the student, if he or she is willing to learn or improve, can easily identify the weak areas, which FACTS the student's missing and so on after some assessments......But for English, I just know I'm not prepared for the test, and I know did bad on the practice ones, but still there is not some concrete evidences I can point out that here, this is my weak area, or this I really do not understand. So it becomes a matter of trial and error and practice, which seems limitless and endless. And Finally, this is the most unique about the English test that's different than EVERY OTHER SUBJECT: ---- YOU CAN NOT CRAM AND STUDY FOR . Yeah it is right that after maybe several, maybe several dozens years of intense study.....You maybe say I'm fully prepared now for the AP english exam........And still the questions bombards you with subjectivity. And just the shear size of the vocabulary, the subtle difference between all the synonymous words, (overstatement, hyperbolie, implies, infers, suggests, what is the intent, argue, dispute...). And it's like your whole life of culture and experience in the world culminates and contributes to your performance on this test. Yeah for a really really stressed, miserably failing, troubled, an extremely unprepared and uncertained kid one weekend before he has to take the AP English language test, This test is just not the test to cram for. All in all, AP English test in my feeling is just hard.......harder than every other test. Unless you are Matt Wu of course. I don't know if any of you share any of the feelings I listed above. So there is my emotional turmoil of the day. Thanks all to all of you who were willing to read this.

Good luck to everyone on this practice test, remember to take it within the alotted time, it is good practice! Love Rob\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Thomas, I totally agree with you that standardized tests are simply unfair/wrong since individuals are not standard. It seems like in America everything is about individuality and ability to strive and achieve, yet society still places standards upon us that we have to pass in order to be \"good citizens.\" I'm myself very frustrated with SATs and ACTs cause no matter if I am \u201csuper smart,\u201d or get 1st places in competitions, I am just bad in analogies and my vocab doesn't include such words as vituperative, or flabbergasted. I personally just came from the WASMUN competition where I was elected Best Negotiator, and Rapatour (I don't know how to spell that) and spoke in front of 600 \"delegates,\" and yet all of that doesn't matter cause I still feel \"not good enough\" cause my awesome SAT scores place me into the \"average/standard\" herd of students. Actually I think it's an awesome idea to encourage our fellow students to participate in conversations by addressing them directly, it really does work... sometimes. In our \"committees\" in MUN (yeah, I am a nerd like that) we can just say \"I yield my time to ....\" and name a delegate that seems to be the least awake; it mostly ends up that he/she has a lot to say and starts participating in the debate, or else you at least you wake them up\u2026 for a while:) About the practice AP test we took, I find it to be the best preparation for the test we can get. I just want to know what I would actually have gotten if it was the real test. I found mult. choice test to be the hardest part of it (stand. tests), the essays were fine. The prompt about Emerson was interesting, especially since we have studied him and read his works; I didn't focus as much on conventions, except for the usage of simple/complex sentences and the \"...\" to communicate effectively. Shakespeare essay was awesome cause I just have read a lot of him and the prompt was pretty broad and open for interpretation. It helps a lot to have background info about prompts. Now I think we should just really focus on reviewing the literary terms and grammar, I have problems coming up with literary terms, and also some of the mult. choice questions on grammar need review. I think our class is well prepared, we all read and write a lot, and Mrs. VA covered grammar/terms pretty well.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I feel this is a great article that everybody should read: urlLink Segregation no longer black and white New issues fifty years after Brown v.

Segregated for a variety of reasons: huge discrepancy of wealth, economic gap, culture differences, community separations, and continued racial problems and misunderstandings. This culturally, economically, and racially segregated school systems in turn shows up in the huge differences in the \"standardized\" testing scores.

However, knowing what it's like to be one of the ones that is not easily motivated to state my opinion during class, I feel that the best way would be to encourage the other students to try to bring the less responsive ones into the discussion. Having a teacher pinpoint you in the middle of a discussion never seems to work too well. Throughout middle school and other classes many teachers have used that as a technique as a form of punishment for not paying attention, but for our class, many people are paying attention they just don't say as much. Therefore if it's the other students it wont be as much of punishment, but should bring about more of a casual converstion which will allow everyone to feel more comfortable.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "As far as I know, Kailie Veys had the highest multiple choice score with an adjusted (incorrect guess penalty included) score of 23/43. Sorry if I betrayed her trust in this, but I'm proud of her accomplishment. On to class participation; I don't think bribing responses is the way to go. Everyone comes out of their shell, some of us are fortunate to have expatriated earlier, but sometimes forcing someone to respond only delays their comfort. The best possible scenario is to create an environment where the shy can feel that their thoughts and feelings will be appreciated. Many people have expressed to me that what they have to say they don't feel other people want to hear; that their thoughts aren't on the same level as the \"intellectuals\"; that they feel stupid with what they have to say. While there isn't anything that can be done about those angsts, for those that don't feel confortable contributing; know that you needn't worry or feel judged. Anything that can be contributed adds to the formation of other thoughts and truely helps a discussion. Lastly; some of those questions in those Peterson tests are so damn frustrating and often times ridiculous. There should never be a scenario where one must choose between \"argue\" and \"dispute.\" They're the same thing!!! In history, the Fed either \"raised interest rates\" or \"discouraged borrowing.\" All the Fed does is control interest rates and inflation, so the answers are the same!!! Traditionally, the practice tests are harder thant he actual tests. For a potentially more accurate representation of your score, you can take old tests that were prepared by the college board, accessible at www.collegeboard.com.

That's actually a great idea actually of setting up a ground rule for everybody to speak, except that I'm not that kind of person who wants to jumpstart forcing other people to speak. But it would be nice for everybody in our class to finally break the \"shyness\" barrior.......after almost a whole year has gone by. So for all you, please just start randomly question \"Underrepresented\" people \"what do you think of this\", or \"what's your opinion on this issue\".

I'm so pleased to see you all carrying on such a lively conversation; you're informed, you're responding to each other, and you're connecting all kinds of ideas and subjects. Literature leads to culture, which leads to politics, which leads to a need to communicate civilly, which leads back to writing and literature. Truly, you folks are the kinds of students teachers dream of when they first go into teaching. I also appreciate your feedback about what is happening in class. Concerning discussion...this has come up before. Those of you who are participating feel like we are in a rut, as if you are dragging many unwilling--or unresponsive--bodies along with you. Speakers and non-speakers become entrenched in their roles, and soon, class is predictable. Boring. So why have I allowed this? Part of my role as a teacher is to facilitate, to push students to do what they would not be willing to do on their own. I have a preferred style, though, that is based on respect of students' choices. I find it very difficult to make a person speak if he or she is not willing. Why? Some people are painfully shy, and to be made to speak causes that student to suffer. I would like class conversation to work like it does at a good dinner party, where people speak because they are interested and engaged. I give all of you prep work, and I make the assumption that if you have done the work, you have the tools to speak. And I expect you to be motivated enough--courageous enough--to conquer fear of a large room and state your opinion. Perhaps this is idealistic of me, yet this is what democracy depends upon. In the way we have a large group of silent people, our class is echoing a societal trend. Small numbers of people bother to get out and vote; small numbers of people in class participate in discussion. What do we do? I could be an autocrat and put people on the spot, giving \"points\" to those who have an anwer. Is this the role of a teacher? Is this what you want class to look like? Feel like? Do you want speaking aloud to be connected to rewards and punishments? To take this analogy further, should we somehow punish people who choose to avoid their responsibilities as US citizens? Dock their pay if they don't vote? The classroom is a special place, though. It wasn't until extra credit was offered that any of you chose to participate in the blog. So what to do? When leaders are organizing activities, one of the things they know to do is to invite specific individuals to participate in the group. All of you who participate in this blog participate in class, also. By speaking aloud, others will see you as class leaders. If you want to maintain a democratic classroom, where students feel like equals and I am not treating you all as minions, what if you were to start inviting other students to respond? Why should I be the one to ask questions, just because I am the teacher? Don't you all ask questions of each other when you are in small groups? What if you start doing this in a large group? Who do you want to hear from? Ask that person a question, draw them in. What kind of encouragement/lessons/announcements (if any) do you need from me to help you take a more active role in making discussion work? I have been in classes before where one of the ground rules for discussion is that no one in the room may make more than 2 comments until everyone has been invited to share something with the large group. We could do this if you'd like. It can feel contrived; however, if you want to change the dynamic of class, this is a system that can help encourage change. What do you think?

I can't tell if I was too redundant or not, but the familiarity with the author DEFINITELY eased the pain. It made reading the passage go much smoother, and I felt not bad about it overall. I was suprised at the Shakespeare prompt because it was so vast and wide, not really what I'm used to.

And within the free-response essays, i felt that the one about the English conventions/language was the hardest, although since the passage was about Emerson, the familiarity of the author kind of comforted me a little. It was weird talking about how Emerson persuades the reader his opinions with the use of \"conventions\", such things as grammar, the parts of English language that I tend to ignore its importance. Yeah so overall, that was a challenging piece to write as the essay prompt demanded \"a well reasoned and organized essay\".

Long term affects are more anti-American senitiments that take a death toll and add hundreds or thousands in a single day (9/11, USS Cole, embassy bombings). If a regime change is the goal, don't lie about it, but as of now Bush is using American men and women to fight for oil, which is necessary to accomodate America's mass automotive transportation. And reflecting current consumer trends and the pressure on Bush to secure American jobs (ridiculous amounts of which outsourced by GM to Mexico), more gas is needed to satisfy the throats of gas-chugging SUV's, trucks, and to a lesser extent, vans; in all of said categories American companies generally control the market.

And I'd hardly compare Kerry to true war heroes such as Audy Murphy, here's a section of an article describing Kerry's Vietnam medals and tour. But neither of those matter, the bottom line is, when you enlist in the military you are enlisting in the military. You job is to be ready for war. In war you are put in harms way. Everyone in Iraq right now knew what they were getting into, we have a volunteer military. The loss of every life, especially the civilian ones, is a great trajedy, the real issue is should we even be in Iraq, but that's a whole other issue.- Kerry served on swift boats for about four months. During that time, he was awarded the Bronze Star (the lowest decoration for heroism in combat) and the Silver Star (the next higher decoration for valor) and three Purple Hearts for wounds sustained in battle. These latter decorations \u2014 like my title of \"nationally syndicated columnist\" \u2014 sound more impressive than they are. All three wounds were minor cuts from shrapnel, which, according to Kerry, caused him to miss a grand total of 2 days of duty. For soldiers and Marines, especially of the enlisted variety, a Silver Star is a big deal. You've got to do something profound to get one. But the rules were different for officers, especially for naval officers. This is the action on Feb. 28, 1969, for which Kerry was awarded the Silver Star: A Viet Cong fired a B-40 rocket at Kerry's boat, Patrol Craft Fast-94. Tom Belodeau, manning the twin 50-caliber machine guns at the rear of the boat, opened fire on the VC, wounding him. The VC fled behind a hooch. Kerry ordered PCF-94 to shore, leaped out of the boat, pursued the VC, and finished him off. I can envision grizzled infantrymen shaking their heads. \"He got the Silver Star for that?\" Kerry had an advantage most servicemen do not. Medal recommendations have to be made by the commanding officer of the unit in which the heroism took place. Kerry was the commander of PCF-94. Presumably, Kerry's medal recommendation was made by the commander of the squadron to which PCF-94 belonged. But Kerry's commander wasn't there. The evidence he had of the heroism of Lt (jg) John F. Kerry came chiefly from the after action report of Lt. (jg) John F. Kerry. Shortly after being awarded the Silver Star, Kerry took advantage of a provision in Navy regulations that permits a sailor who has been wounded three times to obtain early release from his combat tour. For Kerry \u2014 since his wounds were so minor \u2014 this was taking advantage of a technicality. There is nothing wrong with this. Many officers similarly situated would have done the same. But it wasn't heroic. To recap: Kerry was a double volunteer. As a swift boat commander, he was brave and able. But I am unaware of any soldier or Marine who was awarded a decoration of any kind \u2014 much less the Silver Star \u2014 just for killing a wounded man who was running away. Though it is being hyped far beyond what it warrants, Kerry's Vietnam service was honorable. What is not honorable is the way Kerry \u2014 in testimony before Congress in April, 1971 \u2014 falsely accused his fellow Viet vets of routinely committing grisly war crimes. Nor does it speak well of Kerry that in several demonstrations he marched under the flag of the Viet Cong. It is one thing to oppose the war in Vietnam. It is another to cheer for the enemy. Why is there hope in John Kerry? If the major issue with the president choosing to send troops to war, because of the evils of war, then no President since maybe Gerald Ford(I'm just guessing) would fit your criteria. I find it hard to believe President Bush is as cold and heartless as he is portrayed to be here. I really doubt he's any different than any other President, I'd just like to say that character slander is not an effective means of policy debate which is what is truly at debate here. Tell me why Kerry won't be bought because his wife has billions? Kerry is already bought, he's bought because he wants to win. You can't buy votes with billions but you can buy votes with endorsements. Kerry's wife is rich, yes, so she can fund his campaign along with George Soros. But Kerry is already bought by the standard democratic special interest groups, labor unions, environmentalists, trial lawyers(by far the worst) because he hopes their endorsements will entice members of their groups to vote for him. In exchange for those endorsements he agrees to give them more sway in his administration, it's just how the system works. It would be nice if everyone looked out for everyone and the common good but that's not going to happen. All politics are corrupt, Democrats and Republicans equally. I agree completely that we went to Iraq for oil, and I don't think we should be there. I certainly understand the benefits of securing a new nation under our sway in the middle east, removal of bases to Iraq from Saudi Arabia would certainly quell some anti American sentiment in that nation and put our bases closer to Israel. OPEC has too much power over the United States economy and the global economy, but setting a precedent of a preemptive strikes frightens me. Nothing would make me happier to see the US freed from oil, and the Bush administration has done an admirable job of using tax credits to push ahead gas/electric hybrids and to cut oil usage, such as in new federal requirements tying fuel efficiency requirements to vehicle weight. The single issue of gas prices is not what gives the Japanese car makers the edge, it's a rather unique combination of luck, trade policies and union interference that has put detroit second to tokyo as of recently. But this years trends from detroit have been towards cars, while some from Tokyo, most notably Nissan and Honda have certainly been to expand into less fuel efficient vehicles such as SUVs and trucks. It's impossible to generalize on such as level or attribute it to something as arbitrary as gasoline prices. Rob's suggestion of putting a 1 dollar tax on gas is why I'm not a democratic supporter as a general rule. Liberal policies dictates a negative approach to social engineering. Why not offer an incentive, a tax break on buying a gas efficient car or a hybrid. Democratic ethos dictates, RAISE TAXES. Push people away from gas, not try to entice them away. The federal government is simply too inefficient and bureaucratic to justify it taking any more tax money from the private sector. Democrats want to take it away more so than Republicans, but they both want it. Lesser of two evils. I guess that's a rather sad commentary on my approach to politics and maybe our system in general but I digress.

Bush is something like the great great great great nephew of Madison or something. There's no difficulty tracing a Kennedy bloodline either. There is hope in Kerry. He opted to fight in Vietnam rather than lynch himself over a balcony, and his experiences there gave him credibility teaching (what should be the obvious) wrongs of war. His wife has billions, so don't expect him to be bought, and he doesn't claim his greatest mistake was TRADING SAMMIE FUCKING SOSA. The dumbass Bush couldn't run a major league baseball team successfully, but we gave him the country!?!? Edwards was the best answer, but he was too decent to sling mud, so Kerry it is.

Andrew Sullivan wrote a thought-provoking essay supporting the case for a gas tax of $1 per gallon. It's what the rest of the world does, and it would result in a trend toward fuel-efficient cars, cut down on polution, and get many people off the road-reducing accident rates and deaths.

Maybe its not right to say this, but there are too many people that look like blind, brainless cattle that has to be guided and taken care of. Not just in our school, or just in America, but everywhere I have been.

This is probably the only time I will appear as an American egotistical bigot. But I truely believe that America is a country founded on progressive beliefs, reforming individuals, and revolutionary ideas. Famous Americans of the past had always had an urge for freedom of speech, freedom of expression, and freedom of THINKING. The famous American authors of the past: from founding fathers Jefferson, Franklin, Paine, to Transcendentalists Emerson, Thoreau, to poets Whitman, Dickinson, to realist writers Mark Twain, Faulkner, to muckrackers Tarbell, Steffens and to civil rights activist MLK; they all inspire Americans with the vivid themes of individualism and the interaction between the individual and the society. Many of them of course were all considered radicals just because of their progressive ideas. But they are some of the most brilliant Americans. All of them wanted to, and they did, forever change America for the better. Seriously, in comparison, Chinese classical literature is all about the art of war and at the same time harmony with nature (juxtaposed against each other), and respecting elders, and conforming to society (which of course, many of you know I abhor). Yeah the theme of individualism is a farfetch idea in most of the world. To truely live up to the American ideal, I believe American citizens have to always strive for the theme of believe in one self, and strive for individual rights, and find one's unique place in the society. It's when people stop thinking about American literature with the theme of individualism, self reliance, and self-expression, that causes me frustrated. When people stop using brain and thinking about the society with their own unique point of view, and let others make judgements for them, and blindly conforms to the mainstream society, then they've lost the integral value of American individualism. Losing one's unique place in the society fundamentally degrades the morals of human beings, and dictators dreams to have a society of dumb people that blindly conforms to the society. I don't believe that's what America, the land of opportunity, is all about. Thus................Always think for yourself, and always question all authority.

Last year we had a much more cosmopolitan curriculum, and thinking back to Dr. Zhivago, I have to agree with Natalya on the desolation that Pasternak wrote about. We read about Okonkwo too, and the let down he obviously felt when his tribe was weakening. We also have read some western European novels and essays- Tale of Two Cities, All Quiet on the Western Front, et al. Tale of Two Cities was really a political observation where personal relationships just worked themselves out, and All Quiet addressed the feeling of hopelessness war carries. America truly is unique that it hasn't had to experience the despariging wars (other than Civil War) that Europe and Asia have dealt with, and that's the best evidence I can uncover to explain the difference in literary themes. Many people in the world view Americans as arrogant and possessing other undesirable characteristics. Does the attitude that we can do it on our own come through in the lit? Or do Americans just lust for heros? I find this all very interesting. Maybe Tristan will tell me what I want to hear. Shifting gears, what did you all think of the in-class essay today?

I mean, 4 children die every hour from malnutrition... strange, I have been reading Biology for the past hour... 4 children just died... do I feel anything? No. Can I even comprehend the fact that 4 innocent lives just died? Not really. I was watching the news today and they were talking about one of the Italian hostages being killed in Iraq, and I remember thinking: they make such a big deal out of this one death when at the same time there are hundreds, thousands of people dying every day. I think it's simply because we have gotten used to these statistics of how many people are dying in Africa from AIDS and how many have died during the Holocaust. The horror simply gets saturated and you get used to it, and that's how saw Wiesel's experience as his story extended in the book: the first time he saw babies been thrown into the flames of crematory his reaction was \" How could it be possible for them to burn people, children, and for the world to keep silent? No, none of this could be true. It was a nightmare...,\" compared to the reaction of when his father is taken away to the crematory \"I did not weep, and it pained me that I could not weep.

I have read many books like this one, I cried reading \"The Pianist,\" and \"All Quiet on the W.

But I think Russian authors are great on analyzing human nature, and our lonely desolate souls; read \"Crime and Punishment.\" Ryan- you know it's funny how in America everyone simply stands up for himself and takes care of his own private business, but that does leave us lonely and without friends or anyone to talk to. George has to get rid of his burden too in order to be able to go on, but does he need the farm, now that he doesn't have his friend to share it with?

My brother is also big like Lennie, and if anyone else trys to take advandtage of him or make fun of him, it ticks me off. The same thing is with George, no one else can do anything to Lennie except him. I like the way Steinbeck uses a lot of sentence manipulation so you can get a real grip of the attitude the characters have espcecially Lennie, it really helps the reader get into the book more.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "In a discussion about \"Of Mice and Men\" our group observed that George and Lennie's mutualistic friendship creates a theme of interdependence, which differs from the popular theme of self-reliance of the past semester. The works of Emerson, Thoreau, and Franklin represent the fruits of solitude, and promote the benefits of self-sufficiency. In contrast, Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and Men\" shows the loneliness of seclusion and explains how interpersonal relationships are necessary in leading a fulfilled life. When George and Lennie arrive at the ranch they are hired to farm, their bond surprises a well respected ranchhand named Slim. George takes exception to Slim's reaction and Slim explains there aren't \"many guys who travel around together...maybe ever'body in the whole damn world is scared of each other.\" Slim and the some of the other workers are envious and almost admire the friendship George and Lennie share. Their relationship enables them to divide the stress of work and travel, as opposed to bearing it individually. As the novel progresses the theme of mutualism stretches to recruit other characters. Candy, an old, one-handed swamper, loses his dog to old age and sees lonely, desolate days ahead of him. This depresses him and he spends most of his time staring at the wall of his bunk. Crooks, the negro stable buck, isn't allowed to play cards with the guys, and is forced to sleep in a solitary room away from his peers. Time eats away at these friendless men because as Crooks put it, \"A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody.\" Although self-reliance produces independence and pride within a man, it cannot pat him on the back, play a game of cards, or swap stories the way a friend can. Living as an equal in the world is an inherent human goal, and to sacrifice societal equality for isolation produces a burning loneliness that must be tempered with humanity.

My group spent much of the period analyzing what the main theme of the book was and we came to two conclusions. The first theme that we noticed was the naive/optimistic attitude the Jews had towards the Germans and the treatment they would receive in the events that led up to being sent to Auschwitz.(sp?) The basis behind this theme most likely comes from the strong faith Jews had in God at this time period. Even after being sent to the concentration and experiencing the cruel treatment of the Germans, Jews still had an optimistic view stating \"God must be testing us.\" Although Weisel himself begins to lose faith in God, many Jews still believed God was \"just testing them.\" The second theme my group noticed was individualism in the concentration camps. Because the happenings at Auschwitz are so horrible, they begin to mold the spirit of many of the prisoners, Wielsel in particular. This theme is best shown when Wiesel's father is being beaten severely by a crazed guard. Instead of Wiesel becoming angry toward the guard, he instead is angry at his father for getting in the guards way. Wiesel, like many others, lose their ties with family and friends in an effort to \"fend for themselves\" at the concentration camps. These are the two most prominent themes my group saw in the book, are we missing a big one? -Pat\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "During the group descussions today in class, my group noticed something very interesting. I don't know where i'm going to go with it, but i thought i might throw it out there anyway. Our group was talking about Night, and we were busy discussing how horrific/depressing the book is when we heard a neighboring group mention how someone in the other book had lost his pet mouse and therefore all the joy in his world. We went kind of silent for a minute and looked at each other. How does a mouse compare to the Halocaust? And then we just went back to our discussion. But i've been stuck on it all day, and i think that our reaction has as much to say as the juxtoposition of the books does. And i think that it all has something to do with the human ability to completely ingore huge, world changing events (or the inability to understand them), like the halocaust. I'll let the great Eddie Izzard make the next point: \"Pulpot killed 1.7 million people, we can't even deal with that. I think we think if somebody kills someone, that's murder, you go to prision. If you kill 10 people, you to to Texas, they hit you with a brick. That's what they do. Twenty people, you go to a hospital, they look at you through a small window at you forever. And over that, we can't deal with it, you know? Somebody's killed one hundred thousand people, we're almost going, 'well done! well done, you killed 100,000 people? You must get up very early in the morning. I can't even get down to the gym.' ...So i suppose we're glad that Pulpot's under house arrest, at least we know where he is. Just don't go in that house, you know?\" Some people would probably say that we find little ways to deal with huge or horrible things ...like pet mice. But i think that we just completley ignore them. A revolution in Haiti? Ten thousand citizens dead in Iraq? Ariel Sharon pulls out of the West Bank? Terrorists attack Madrid? Oh. Okay. ...Did i leave the iron plugged in? God, my boyfriend's being so annoying these days. Do i look fat in this shirt?... Nevermind the 25 million people that die every year from hunger. Or the 34.3 million people who are looking a little skinny since they contracted AIDS. I'm not suggesting that we should think about this all the time every day, but it is valuable to be reminded every now and then. So yeah...

Mostly when he was older, but I found a picture taken when he was 15 or 14 before he was in the concentration camps. It made me think about the end of the book when he's looking in the mirror. I looked at the picture and I tried to imagine what he looked like at the end of the war. Here's a good quote from Wiesel. I think it does a pretty good job at summerizing why he wrote 'Night' and why understanding what happened during the Holocaust is so important. \"I have tried to keep memory alive, I have tried to fight those who would forget.

Does anyone remember the debates of 2000 when W. Bush adamantly and outwardly expressed his distaste for the way Clinton was using the military? Saying directly that U.S. troops should not be used for nation building in other countries. Hmm... why does W. Bush want to reinstate the draft again? Ohh, that's right, it's because he needs more troops to continue his nation building in Iraq. Afghanastan was a justified war. I entirely understand why the Taliban had to be removed, and (with international backing) it was the right decision to invade. What W. Bush told the country the reason for invading Iraq was is SOMEWHAT legitimate because Saddam possessing biological/chemical weapons is a threat to our ally Israel, but that's not the reason he decided to invade. He can blame intelligence all he wants, but suggesting Iraq had tried to acquire Uranium based on zero evidence isn't the kind of credibility I want in a Commander In Chief. Now, as the motives continue to change, hundreds of Americans are dead because of a W. Bush lie, and he wants thousands more to risk their lives for a quest he said was not worth fighting before he was elected. I scoff at those who want to support W. Bush because they believe KERRY flip-flops positions. The more I think about it the sicker I get. I might type more, but I'm off to do my taxes, attempting to get back some of the money W.

The book so far is faring better than it's intro paragraphs, which when I heard Ms.VA read in class today, I thought it would be so boring. But right now it's becoming more and more like a Western Thriller book, with A LOT of Western vernacular language (as oppose to the Southern vernacular language we encountered in Huck Finn). It's easy to relate to that a lot of language directly imitates the coloquial language as people are speaking (non-sensored words). So overall, a comfortable read. Other than that, I encountered this article: urlLink about some members of the congress are even THINKING of RE-INSTATING the DRAFT.........Utterly sick.......... Yeah anyways, thats a great article, also talks about in December 2003 the United States had 1.44 million troops stationed in 141 countries. And here is an excerpt from an article from CNN: CHARLES RANGEL Democratic Congressman from New York and Korean War vet Staying the course in Iraq means increasing our troop strength, and, not surprisingly, recruitment and re-enlistment levels are down. But proposed enlistment bonuses and other economic incentives will not make the military any more attractive to upper-middle-class young people. Increasingly we will be a nation in which the poor fight our wars while the affluent stay home. To correct the disparity among those who serve, South Carolina Senator Fritz Hollings and I have proposed a new draft. All men and women ages 18 to 26 would be eligible for induction once they have completed high school. Those not needed in the military would perform civilian service. Enacting our plan would democratize our armed forces and return to the \"citizen soldier\" ideal that has served our nation so well. As a veteran, I strongly believe that fighting for our country must be fairly shared by all racial and economic groups. Nobody wants to go to war, but the burden of service cannot fall only on volunteers who, no matter how patriotic, are attracted to the military for financial reasons. We cannot continue to pretend it is fair that one segment of society makes all the sacrifices. CHARLES MOSKOS Professor of sociology at Northwestern University and a former draftee Our country is facing new kinds of threats and needs a new kind of draft. Even before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, our military was severely overstretched in fulfilling its missions. But more important, we have done nothing serious about homeland defense in the war against terrorism. We need guards for our nuclear power plants, dams and public facilities. We have done little to create the necessary border patrollers, customs agents and cargo-ship inspectors. Short-term draftees, under professional supervision, could perform these duties admirably. It takes less than four months to train a military police officer\u2014precisely the kind of role most needed in peacekeeping missions and guard duties. This would free up professional soldiers, and it would stop the unprecedented activation of reservists. Their multiple tours have led to demoralization and impending recruitment shortfalls. We must institute a three-tiered draft system in America, with 15-to-24-month tours of duty for citizens ages 18 to 26. In the new-style draft, conscripts could serve in the military, in homeland security or in a civilian-service program like AmeriCorps\u2014and there is no reason women could not be drafted for the latter categories JAMES INHOFE Republican Senator from Oklahoma I think I'm the only member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who would reinstate the draft. There are huge social benefits that come from it. I can assure you I would not be in the U.S. Senate today if I had not gone through the draft. When I look at the problems of some of our kids in America nowadays and then I go visit the troops, I see what a great benefit it is to give people the opportunity to serve their country. I was drafted into the Army in January 1957 and served two years as an enlisted man. I gained a new outlook on life through the rigors of basic training. The military can have a more intense influence on soldiers when they are drafted and have no choice. I developed a sense of patriotism through the experience of serving my country. I'm not on a crusade, but I think today's youth could use more of that type of discipline.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "So far I am really enjoying the novel 'Night' due to the way in which the novel is written.

Anyway, I remembered something Mrs. VA said about her German friend and how he is still paying for WWII through high taxes, and how he was really upset because he had nothing to do with Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.

My essay I wrote easily in one sitting. It was nice to forego a certain amount of literary analysis and focus on personal response because I felt like I was able to get something off my chest. I'll post it if desired, but it's more or less a more personal extension of the post with the long quote. Lastly (this is a very quick-moving post), the Harry Potter story line is nothing new. The classic series'; Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, and even Star Wars have taken the theme of the conflict between Good and Evil and given it a different setting. The story lines each include some standard elements of personal struggle and sacrifice, making the story quite predictable, yet gripping nonetheless. For example, Luke Skywalker must resist the Dark Side of the Force, Frodo frequently expresses the grip he knows the ring has on him, and even Harry Potter fought with himself in his choice of House, ultimately siding against Slytherin's beckoning promise of power. I could make a pretty good guess to the end of the series because they all end very similarly, but I will NOT stop reading them till Voldemort is contained and Harry graduates (or maybe he dies in sacrifice, that OCCASIONALLY happens, but I doubt it in this instance). The key to writing a successful series is the ability to weave reader interaction into a story as Rachel addressed, and equally important, putting a unique spin on the fantastic setting.

My paper was a parody on Holden and I just hope Mrs. VA won't be too disturbed by the \"creativity\" of my imagination in this paper. It was actually really fun to explore the thoughts of a potential character like that, I could draw a lot for my writing from my guy-friends and their thoughts that they express verbally, I think I could write a whole book just in that kind of a colloquial style, exploring the different ideas people have in their mind during the day. I ran our of my reading mood, so Their Eyes were Watching God is only half finished for now, but so far my reaction to it is: men are sexist and generally evil, with rare exceptions. That is of course an exaggeration but the feeling I get from the book so far is that men find a girl, get what they want from her, that is love and attachment and then either get bored and move on to another \"victim\" or exploit the already used and hypnotised girl to fullest potential. I just couldn't believe it how Janie's first husband first begged her to marry him and then went to by her a mule so that she could plow his fields. The same with her second husband Jody who first says: \"you behind a plow! You ain't got no mo' business wid uh plow than uh hog is got wid uh holiday! ... A pretty dall-baby lak you is made to sit on de front porch and rock and fan yo'self and eat p'taters dat other folks plant just special for you.\" It's ridiculous how he very soon placed her behind the counter of his shop and scoundreled her for miscounting. I just wouldn't believe the swift change from adornment to \"... you [Janie] need tellin'. Somebody got to think for women and chillun and chickens and cows. I god, they sho don't think none theirselves.\" I just love the comparison between women and chickens, no wonder the word \"chicks\" addressed toward girls is still in the lexicon. I want to finish the book though, maybe Tea Cake will bring some optimistic news about the race of men and will lower down my cynicism. I was just wondering if anyone has any ideas about the significance of Janie's beautiful hair and the crazy mule running around. Call me a nerd but I love Harry Potter books, they are just so beyond imagination it's fascinating. They inspire me to write something like that too, only it's hard to come up with new ideas for a story; I think I am going to go think about some potentially successful ideas for a plot, maybe that will get me into Harvard, or at least I could make millions of dollars selling the books and then just bribe the admisions officers;) I think the movies are not that great though. Lord of the Rings series were better and closer to the actual book. These kinds of books are just fun to read in order to get away from the ordinary world, afterall it gets really boring here sometimes and they don't take that long to read becuase they have such straigh-forward ideological content: the good always wins, yet I have to agree with Pat that they are a bit stricky in the story line. I am still struggling with Fountainhead though, that book is insane, the more I read of it the harder it becomes and the more I want to read it.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I don't know about the rest of you, but I would like to read some of the other papers that students have written to see different perspectives on the topics. I will share mine, it was based on The Great Gatsby, and I chose the second prompt that concerned how the book has influenced our beliefs....read mine but I would really like to read others papers so please share. A Positive Influence on My Beliefs I have been raised to believe in the importance of Christian values that have shaped me into the moral person I am today. After reading The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald and encountering the degradation of values concerning upper-class society in the 1920\u2019s, I have been influenced to strengthen my moral values. Fitzgerald\u2019s novel is portrayed through a description of two wealthy Long Island communities where the center of attention is the Gatsby mansion where \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d holds his famous parties where Fitzgerald focuses his novel on the characters of Tom and Daisy Buchanan and Nick Carraway(the narrator). Fitzgerald uses the beliefs of these characters to mock and show the beliefs of 1920\u2019s upper-class society. Jay Gatsby is an \u201cOxford man\u201d who, after fighting in World War I becomes fabulously wealthy through criminal business to pursue his love-Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby is portrayed as a mysterious figure who everyone admires for his extravagant amount of wealth. Gatsby\u2019s attitude toward money is shown in a quote that is taken from a flashback on Gatsby\u2019s life stating \u201cTo young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world.\u201d The authors reasoning for showing the materialistic attitude is for the reader to make the connection of how money can corrupt one\u2019s thinking. Gatsby, like many other characters in the novel, is so engrossed in wealth that it seems to be the sole thing that gives him satisfaction in his life. Gatsby\u2019s obsession with wealth is nothing compared to the attitude of Daisy Buchanan, a longtime lover of Gatsby. Daisy Buchanan is not interested in love, but completely in material possessions. Daisy\u2019s attitude is best described in a quote when Daisy is admiring en extensive collection of Gatsby\u2019s shirts. She states, \u201cThey\u2019re such beautiful shirts,\u2019 she sobbed, her voice muffled in thick folds. \u2018It makes me sad because I\u2019ve never seen such-such beautiful shirts before.\u201d Fitzgerald is able to portray a multitude of character insights in this small quote. First and foremost Fitzgerald is depicting Daisy as a fool for being so engrossed in a collection of shirts. Also, the author gives insight as to what Daisy\u2019s true love is-wealth. Daisy married her husband Tom because he had money, not because she loved him as a person. Tom knows what Daisy\u2019s true love is, and in response began an affair with a woman in the city. Fitzgerald uses Daisy\u2019s attitude and the relationship between Tom and Daisy to show the corrupt beliefs of upper-class marriages during this time period. Fitzgerald is saying that upper-class marriages weren\u2019t based upon love-but two selfish people getting what they, without regard to morals. While most the characters are immersed in materialism, Nick Carraway has contrasting beliefs. Nicks beliefs are based upon morals, not money. In the end of the novel, Nick makes the decision to move away from the upper-class society of the East, and move back to the Midwest where morality is more important than money. Nick describes his decision when saying \u201c...the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes\u2019 power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry on the line I decided to come back home.\u201d Nick makes a decision to get away from what he knows will influence him and eventually corrupt his beliefs. Through analyzing the beliefs of these characters, my own personal beliefs have been influenced greatly. Fitzgerald\u2019s portrayal of a corrupt upper-class society made me realize that I am so very fortunate and that I take for granted the wealth that I am immersed in. I am far from a Daisy Buchanan, but am still caught up in material possessions from time to time. After reading this book, I am sickened that the upper-class in this book wasted their lives living a life where they were unable to love one another normally because they were so greatly influenced by material possessions. What is the point in having an extravagant shirt collection? Where is the need to host a party every weekend that leads to a myriad of people being plastered with alcohol. It is a complete waste that I don\u2019t ever want to be a part of. I have developed such strong beliefs from reading this book that instead of spending my money on upgrading my car this summer, it will go towards something useful. I am so very glad I read this book, for it opened my eyes to what is really important in life and that is not possessions, it is giving back when I have the ability to share my wealth. SO THERES MY PAPER.......WHAT DO Y'ALL THINK?\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "First of all, I have to say that Pat you couldn't explain Harry Potter any better. Something about the plot captivates the reader, but I have never stopped to think about what it could be... How could I when I wasn't even able to stop to put them down? Being a person that has read all of the Harry Potter books countless numbers of times, everytime I read them I pick up on another clue that has a link to a later point in the plot. You don't even understand how excited I was to realize that Moony, was because he was a wearwolf, Wormtail was because he was a rat and had a tail like a worm, Padfoot the dog, and Prongs was the stag. I seriously set down my book and was amazed... Maybe it was a little more obvious for others, but when different things in the book all of a sudden click and come together and you get the feeling that a light bulb just came on, its irreplaceable. That's why these books are good for all ages, younger kids wouldn't necessairly make all of the connections but the mere plot and setting of a magical place that all of us wish we could be a part of would be enough to draw them in. While adults and teenagers are able to make all of the small connections that makes for a thrilling read. As you can tell, I'm absolutly in love with Harry Potter, and June 4th is marked on my calender! I can't even wait... Now for a more serious side, Ryan I can see exactly what you mean about Their Eyes Were Watching God. It definitly focuses on how money and status are not everything in a relationship and you can't \"buy\" love. Although it's always said, but it's true, love only comes on its own. Janie could have had anything she wanted when she was with Jody, but the love was not there. However when she was with Tea Cake and didn't have a big house and everything else she was never happier. It just goes to show that love is the most important part of relationships and nothing can replace it. - Rachel Penny\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "The most respected black writer of the Harlem Renaissance, Richard Wright, said of Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, \u201c[it] carries no theme, no message, no thought,\u201d and after reading the novel for myself I came to the conclusion that Mr. Wright\u2019s perspective and preformed filters limited his ability to perceive the delicate and emotional subtleties of the story. Their Eyes Were Watching God records one woman\u2019s pursuit of love, a venture which is beautifully complex and unexpectedly educational. Unlike a majority of black writers in the 1930s who created serious, in-your-face literature, Hurston chose to write a novel that extended beyond the black protest tradition and connected with readers on a level unaffected by race or gender. Hurston does not blatantly broadcast an image of black struggle as her early critics would have preferred; instead, she unfurls a story, revealing intricacies of love and emotion that many men are never privy to. Although writers such as Richard Wright believe love to be trivial in comparison to the awareness of black oppression, Hurston\u2019s novel should be commended for discussing unique and unexplored topics. Their Eyes challenges the notion that riches and status alone can attract a woman to a man, and reinforces the message that a man must respect a woman for her mind for a relationship to be truly fulfilling. The emotional journey of Janie Crawford, the female protagonist, encouraged me to believe that true love is attainable through perseverance, and that the tragedy of loss is outweighed by the memories of time spent with a soul mate.

(Don't laugh, I know all of you read these books.....and love them) First of all, the genius of J.K. Rowling is her organization. How many times have you been reading these books and come across a turn in the plot, and then remembered hearing a small clue earlier in the book or in a past book that led directly to a crucial part in the book. To clarify that last statement I will give some examples. EX 1: Harry has to live with the Dursleys-find out later this gives him protection when he's away from Hogwarts. EX 2: Ron's rat Scabbers-find out later it is Wormtail, supporter of Voldemort who framed Sirius and lived with Ron and his family to be able to hear news from the wizarding world concerning Voldemorts whereabouts/possible return. While the plot is deeply woven for a simple children's novel, this is not the only reason for the success of these books. What makes these books so wildy popular is the way in which the reader is so captivated by the setting of a wizarding world in which spells and flying is a reality. What kid could resist a fantasy like this? I sure couldn't. I am 17 years old and am still spellbound(pun). I have talked to adults that are more obsessed than I am. If anyone caught last weeks TRL on MTV is was all about Harry Potter and kids dressed up in robes and competed to get a role on the next Harry Potter film. One girl participating was able to name the license plate number of the Weasley's car in the second movie.....that is seriously ridiculous. Speaking of ridiculous, the winner was a kid about our age who literally was jumping up and down, crying with joy after he won the contest. I'm sorry but after reading Benjamin Franklin's autobiography I was hardly jumping up and down with joy.(I am not bashing Benjamin Franklin-just pointing out how a setting can contribute to the joy of reading a novel) So now that I have gone off on a tangent, I would like to hear from anyone else that has been so engrossed in the novels as I have. Call me obsessive, I don't even care. Read the books-then call me obsessive. Yes, these novels will probably not help you get into an Ivy League school but don't we deserve a treat after all the reading we have done this year?

My favorite (besides \"my mother is a fish\") in As I Lay Dying comes from the woman who lays dying. The quote comes at the end of a chapter that deals with the nature of words- how words and names are used to describe emotions and feelings but they're always insufficient if there isn't first hand knowledge of the experience that the word's trying to describe. As an example... \"I would think Anse (the name of her husband). Why Anse. Why are you Anse. I would think about his name until after a while I could see the word as a shape, a vessel, and I would watch him liquify and flow into it like cold molasses flowing out the darkness into a vessel, until the jar stood full and motionless: a significant shape profoundly without life like an empty door frame; and then I would find that I had forgetten the name of the jar. I would think: The shape of my body where I used to be a virgin is in the shape of a and I couldn't think ANSE, couldn't remember ANSE. It was not that I could think of myself as no longer unvirgin, because I was three now (had three kids now). And when I would think CASH and DARL (the names of her first two children) that way until their names would die and solidify into a shape and then fade away, I would say, All right. It doesn't matter what they call them. \"And so when Cora Tull would tell me I waas not a true mother, I would thinnk how words go straight up in a thin line, quick and harmless, and how terribly doing goes along the earth, clinging to it, so that after a while the two lines are too far apart for the same person to straddle from one to the other; and that sin and love and fear are just sound that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forget the words. Like Cora who could never even cook.\" Sorry for the long intro- but keeping that attitude towards words in mind, comprehend the significance of the quote I really wanted to address. \"One day I was talking to Cora. She prayed for me because she believed I was blind to sin, wanting me to kneel and pray too, (this is the big part) because people to whom sin is just a matter of words, salvation is just a matter of words too.\" I read it as questioning a lot of peoples' grasp on religion. Sinners who believe that sin is just in words miss the meaning of words, miss the meaning of sin. Addie really does know sin, she has a child from a man outside her marriage and holds resentment towards her whole family as well as God.

Even with Holden's very personal, eclectic ideas, interrupted and day-dreaming like train of thoughts, my brain can somehow feel a connection.

I feel like I can easily follow Holden's train of thoughts, even when he daydreams from one seemingly unrelated topic to another. That's just how the human brain thinks. Salinger constructed such a real, believable teenager figure. Finally, as Paul advertised so nicely, besides the great New York Times, there is also the great magazine New Yorker everyone should read.

And it's true that maybe the story doesn't need the extraneous ornaments but it's just much more engaging to see what the author himself has to say about the story, it creates a conversation as you read the book between you and Fitzgerald. Rob, sorry but I didn't find AILD yet, so I started on Their eyes were watching God, but I will get to it as soon as I find the book.

As I read the book I had this feeling that he was a bit strange, but because the book was written as his own personal thoughts I just took it for normal that his mind wondered all over, I sort of think we all have that in our mind where we think of random thinks during the day once in a while. I also heard a lot of criticism of the character, but I still believe that he is a really nice person that has just come to a state of dissatisfaction with the society around him; he does exaggerate a lot and he seems to be critical of everyone and everything he sees, but it sounds like it all comes from bitterness and depression of his character. Maybe he wants to be a catcher in the rye because he knows that there is no one else to catch him if he were to jump off a cliff.

Zora Neale Hurston writes about a woman named Janie searching for her soul mate and finding a few duds along the way. In the process, Hurston provides insight into the female perspective in a way I've never encountered. When women speak of love it seems as though they carefully construct a model of an ideal relationship, but the honest solitude of writing allows Hurston to leak key secrets about the art of war/love. A recurring metaphor in the novel compares perfect love to the blossom of a pear tree, and through the exploits of Janie, the protagonist, the author defines the love blossom as a relationship in which a man treats a woman as his equal and respects her mind, all the while making her glow from every fingertip and toe. Easier said than done? Absolutely, but Their Eyes chronicles the mistakes of foolish men, writing a virtual how-not-to book on love. I feel I'm a more complete person after reading it because I attained a deeper understanding of female emotion and compassion. I believe Their Eyes is a book that should be read by all men because it teaches how women feel and why they feel the way they do, key bits that are rarely divulged and usually left to be deciphered through telepathy, a skill that few of us poor saps are granted. Zora Neale Hurston's novel may be about encountering womanhood, but it\u2019s a worthwhile read for everyone because it demystifies the differences between the sexes and could possibly save or prevent a future dysfunctional marriage. -By: Ryan Elliott PS - I had no idea anyone could think as beautifully as Hurston does in this book\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I'm coming to the end tonight Beck, but there is certainly no doubt in my mind that each one of those Bundren's is crazier than the next.

The Great Gatsby criticizes the \"roaring twenties\" by depicting the upper class' lifestyle that consists of breaking prohibition laws, having affairs, and murder. Throughout the book I felt a sense of this lifestyle that I can only describe as \"hollow.\" That may not make sense, but it seemed to me as if the novel showed the upper class as not having a role in society, just partying and living a life that didn't have a significant meaning. Going back to my thought on how this novel is successful due to its criticism of society, I can draw many similairities between this novel and Huckelberry Finn. Both novels consisted of a central character that had the role of the narrator, both mocked society of the time period, and both novels a relationship between the narrator and another central character that grew as the novel progressed-both resulting in the parting of these two characters at the climax of the novel.

If I begin to ramble I apologize. First I'd like to talk about the significance of the title. When his sister asked him what he liked I was anxious to hear his answer. Immediately he ponders some off-the-topic idea and comes back to the topic after his sister says, \"You can't even think of one thing.\" He responds with, \"Yes, I can. Yes, I can.\" He than talks about his brother and the enjoyment he gets out of talking to his sister. These things he comes up with are so simple. Then he tells about how he simply wants to be a catcher in the rye. I like the connection Natalya made with the James Castle and the \"catcher\" Holden. This seems like one of many intricate connections that Salinger makes. Finally I think the title signifies he wants a simple life with a simple purpose. Now I finally see the connection with his displeasure with \"phonies.\" Phonies to Holden suggest some sort of unneeded attention aimed at bettering the perception other people have on them. This adds to the idea that he wants a simple life that is not fake and that has a purpose. Obviously one can see that being \"phony\" has no \"real\" purpose. This contributes to his dislike of the idea. One thing I noticed was the abrupt conclusions Holden comes to when looking at different situations in his life. It's hard to find examples, a few off the top of my head are: the inferiority complex and the conceited men, the kids always having to meet their friends and the yearbook handsomeness. He even ends his story with a simple conclusion of his. Hmm... That was somewhat helpful for me. I hope I didn't sound like a rambling idiot. Oh yeah, does anyone see the significance with the ducks? ~Frank\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I'm reading \"AILD\" as well, Rob, and i quite agree; it is fascinating. Have you got the end yet? It's CRAZY. Sort of.... unexpected anyway. Mrs VA introduced the book by telling us that the Bundren family was simply unintelligent (\"really stupid,\" i think she said) but i've come to a different understanding of them. (No offense to Mrs VA - I was just using you as a handy introduction-type idea). Anse is the only person in the book who strikes me as truley stupid, but i think his stupidity comes from his country stubborness and pride. The rest of them are pretty much just pure crazy as opposed to dumb. Cash pulls through in the end as the sanest of the bunch - too bad his leg is rotted off. I think that Darl's developement is very interesting; his narrations retain some of his characteristic vocabulary, but he is badly cracked by the end.

You have to read it, there are no words of explanation for this masterpiece. People \"die with every day that passes. When you meet them, they're not what you met last. In any given hour, they kill some part of themselves. They change, they deny, they contradict - and the call it growth.

Having read both Gatsby and Catcher, I find it kind of fun to play along as you get to know Holden and slowly resent 20's life. Right now I'm reading As I Lay Dying, and it's like nothing I've ever read before. The style is insanely unique (albeit a little difficult to get used to) as Faulkner switches narrators from one miserable member of the Bundren family to another with each passing chapter. Faulkner gives real personality to the characters not by description, per se, but by narrating as they think. For instance, Vardaman is the youngest of the characters, and his narration is distinct for his simple vocab and run on sentences that accurately depict the excitement of a child. Darl on the other hand is viewed as a deep thinker so his vocab is more expansive and Faulkner really tries to play around with language and philosophy under the pretense of death. While I rejoice that my classmates enjoy their respective novels, I'm slightly disappointed I have but one compatriot that can share the sentiments of my novel.

Love Rob\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Hey Nova, thanx for joining us, it's been getting rather quiet here lately.... The Great Gatsby is not that great after all, I guess it's just not my kind of \"great literature.\" First I though I was missing something in the book, but now I think that it's the but the book that's missing something... The author states his doctrine on the first page: \"whenever you feel like criticizing anyone... just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had,\" which dictates the rest of the book making it \"lack\" any kind of criticism expressed by the narrator or any \"reflections\" upon the issues raised by the actions of characters in the book. He simply leaves it all for the reader to interpret and draw her/his own conclusions. I understand that's great in the fact that it makes you think for yourself about what you read instead of just reading off the dogmas that the author provides you with layed out on a silver plate. But my problem is that I need someone to discuss the book with, even if it be the author himself through the context of the \"sophisticated sentences\" he writes down in his book, or his thoughts. That's why I think I liked Catcher in the Rye so much more, the author just told you everything he thought, even though all the digressions could sometimes get distracting. It's strange how the book just gives you three days of this boy's life but you know everything about his character you could ever find out. I first thought he was rather sardonic and just negative in general toward life and people, all of his comments and criticism, but toward the end of the book I couldn't help but love this boy. The way he just tells his little sister how he wants to be a catcher in the rye.. \"standing on the edge of some crazy cliff... I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff...I have to come out from somewhere and catch them...\" and just makes you feel like you know that he would have caught that boy that jumped out of the window and that he would have kept that young girl from selling her body and that he would have donated all of his money to those two nuns if he could... just the simple things he says and does make him so unrealistically true and \"good\"...

I'm finding the catcher in the rye an easy and memorable read. I personally find the characters very realistic, especially Holden, I enjoy how the entire book is simply living the life of somebody who's our age, but engrossing simply because Salinger paints such an accurate portrait. But I'm not hearing unanimous agreement from others, since people in my small group are finding different views of the book. But what's really on my mind isn't the catcher in the rye, for me it's the aftermath of the ISEF fair. Aside from meeting kids who I'm sure will be extremely successful before they're 30, I saw a group of 4 of them on my favorite business commentator's show, Lou Dobbs, talking about their projects tonight. I wish I could accomplish as much as they have already. I'm having the hardest time finding a good idea which real practical applications. Getting started is always hardest but I digress.

He really did a great job and it is thanx to him that our team got all the first places:) And I invite everyone to join our club, you never know what hidden talents you have. Going on to Gatsby, I see the irony of Gatsby's \"friends\" not even coming to his funeral and the fact that his beloved Daisy runs off and he has to pay for her mistake with his own life. The scenes of the party in his house are truly what the 20s were like for the elite and give me just a general visual of pigs partying in dirt, a feeling of disgust. Also disturbing is the fact that Tom's mistress Myrtle is like that puppy he bought for her on the street, and that he can throw her away as easily as that puppy. I loved the description of women of that time as elegant and mysterious which then created a special contrast with their greed for money and superficial expression of love. I mean I see a lot of themes going on in the book and they are quite obviously related to materialism, but it feels like there is something missing in it, like it's too easy or maybe I just expected too much from the book after hearing all these great things about it. I liked the book, but I don't feel like it changed my life or like it is a masterpiece of literature.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Hey Rob, in response to your welcome to me as to returning to the \"real world\", I have a few words to say. Forgive me if I sound like a nerdy bigot here. First of all, I have to say that yes, certainly, I've got your note you so graciously left on my exhibit booth. I have to thank with my deepest appreciation to all and everyone who came to visit Intel ISEF on Thursday or Friday. With all the scientific jargons EVERYWHERE in the beloved ISEF exhibits hall that would probably intimidate a good deal of people just with their first step into the ISEF exhibit hall, yes I do agree the environment I was immersed in for the past whole week is out of touch with the \"rest of the society\". But on a different note, we had the wonderful opportunity to meet people from ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD.....We were chatting about not just what scientific discoveries, methods, projects we worked on over the past years, but we ISEF finalists also discussed politics (yeah discussing politics with people from other countries is kinda interesting), our hometowns, schools, and just our personal nerdy lives in general. We also have had LOTS AND LTOS OF SOCIAL LIFE....more social life in the past week than I've ever had in my life. Just being in the convention center makes you feel more mature, and everything was in adult settings and business attires. All the strict rules, politeness, civilness in conjunction with meeting professors, Nobel Laureates, leading scientists and teachers of all fields that represent modern society. True, all of these cameras, press, Nobel laureates are probably very special, but these famous people (both adults and ISEF students) I met do constitute part of our world and the contributions of the scientists is what move the society forward, not the verbatim politicians. Besides, I'd rather be in a environment of overly academicness, formalness, and overly famous people to see what really the world of brainpower is like than be in an environment that encourages some kind of phobia to academia and modern sciences (We had some fun times chuckling and making fun of Bush on the bureaucracy and the political barriers to modern science advances, such as the stem cell research, and it was started by Nobel Laureates) YEAH SO ISEF ALL THE WAY....5000 times more REAL WORLD! lol. And now I'm looking forward to catch up all the work I've missed the past week lol. Catcher in the Rye seems to be a very comfortable reading right now. I've looking forward to discussing the book with other interested readers.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Wow, it's been a few days since I last checked the blog and I feel so out of touch... so I have some preambulatory clauses to address before I get to the real, English-related topic of the post. First and foremost, I'd like to CONGRATULATE the members of Skyview MUN for their various awards and other successes at the district tournament this weekend, RECOGNIZING the efforts of the Russian Federation in successfully warding off the political opposers of the Rodina FURTHER RECOGNIZING that said efforts resulted in both best team in General Assembly as well as best team overall and, LOOKS FORWARD TO seeing the big ass trophy that results I really had a good time and look forward to participating in the future. Secondly, Thomas, welcome back to the real world. I hope you got my note when I went to visit you and you weren't there, but if you didn't, I came to support the scientific mind Natalya has recognized as a Hottie. Now to the Great Gatsby... I feel like a major nerd here, but I really enjoyed the book and feel I was able to track the author and accompanying symbolism. (This is where I feel like a nerd) I would therefore like to reference the independent reading report I did on it earlier on in the year; The Great Gatsby is considered the great American novel because below the cloak of an extravagant love story is the erosion of American society in the Roaring 20\u2019s, or \u201cJazz Age,\u201d as Fitzgerald dubbed it. Gatsby himself is the symbol of the American dream as Fitzgerald saw it: he\u2019s rich and therefore a socialite, he throws lavish parties where hundreds of \u201cfriends\u201d come to his mansion to glorify the vices of society, namely alcohol and sex, and he pursues unrealistic fantasies on a whim, attempting to bend reality to fit his sensibilities. Gatsby\u2019s love interest, Daisy, is respectable and accountable, besides being desirable. When Gatsby tries to woo Daisy, and runs into obstacles, it is apparent in Gatsby\u2019s demeanor that the American lifestyle is unraveling, as demonstrated in his cessation of party hosting. In the end, when Gatsby\u2019s protection of Daisy results in his death, it is apparent at his funeral when none of his \u201cfriends\u201d come to mourn how the American lifestyle is truly viewed; as base, vile, and taboo. Long story short, Gatsby was symbolic of the twenties life-style, (as AP US History should have taught you) a life-style that Fitzgerald was against. Viewing Gatsby as an embodiment of the Roaring 20's may alter your position toward him and his actions as you read. Some other interesting symbolism was the role of the Green Light that was Gatsby's hope in reuniting with Daisy, and the role of the Dr.'s Eyes. I really really enjoyed Gatsby, so if anyone who is reading it wishes to discuss it extracurricularly, I'd love to participate. I'd also like to note that Faulkner's As I Lay Dying is an entirely different style than I believe I've encountered before, and the humor and complexity of the book make it a lot of fun as well. I love that post AP test, there is still so much interest in American Lit. Love Rob\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "HEY MS.VA AND ALL MY AP ENGLISH FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!

Intel International Science and Engineering Fair is truly world class and the experience once in a life opportunity. The awards and free stuff we got were only a temporary excitement, but the most valuable experience was making great friends from all 50 states and 40 countries around the world!!!!!! It's 100% probable that one or two friends you make in ISEF will be in the future leaders of the world, billionaires, or Nobel Laureates. The country and state pin exchanges, the plethora of ISEF ceremonies, all the social events were truly amazing. Furthermore, we the ISEF competitors got to be in a press like room with the Nobel Laureates as a panel. We were like the press asking the prestigious Nobel Laureates questions and they would answer us right there. It was truly astounding. Yeah I guess the most important idea I've learned and experienced through this ISEF event is that seriously, there are sooooooooooooooo much talents and brainpower out there in the world, even with the everyday person around us.

I just finished \"The Great Gatsby\" today and I have kind of mixed feelings toward the book. I have heard a lot of people say good things about it and on the back of the book it says \"American masterpiece\" but my question is: what is the point of the book? I just feel dumb right now cause I didn't really find an actual point, or an underlined message or some \"truth\" or a \"revelation.\" The book was really well written and was engaging, I thought it was great from the very beginning, but I somehow expected more from it and I guess the end just threw me off, as if Fitzgerald just left the book unfinished. I didn't even get it first that the last page I read was the last page of the book, I expected a \"to be continued...\" So I am really looking forward to a discussion of the book as soon as everyone has finished it, meanwhile Catcher in the Rye seems quite interesting, I like its colloquial style and a somewhat humorous tone, the author is great in his ability to delineate a very vivid and a realistic picture of this boy, I like the beginning: \"I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything.

You have worked hard and applied yourselves, and through that process, you've been united by a shared goal. Hang onto this; let your mutual respect for each other be the prevalent theme of your senior year. The worst part of high school is living with the horrid restrictions that come from cliques; if you can see past those imagined lines, you won't need to live your life with a countdown. I encourage you to come to school each day with the intent to build relationships so that by the time your ten or twenty year reunion rolls around, you'll genuinely want to go and can show up in a non-inebriated state. Thanks, everyone, for your honest evaluations of class. The consensus of the group was that it would have been helpful to have seen practice exams earlier in the year in order to have some context for our topics of study. I also realized--far too late--that I could have made our SOAPS/Tone analysis more relevant for you by asking you to write essays that incorporated it. I made the assumption that this was something you already knew, but Natalya's posting made it clear that this was something she (and probably most) had to discover. My guess is, though, that many people haven't made this connection. So...I know what I can do to improve. This brings up an interesting observation in response to Thomas' posting about teachers and students. Teachers think they're invaluable...students think they can independently learn everything they need...I believe that neither is true. Bad teachers limit good students...A teacher can only be as good as students allow her to be. The best classrooms exist where everyone realizes that mutual responsibility is necessary. So, as always, thanks for coming in with curiosity and a good work ethic. As for you, Thomas...IF you have time to read and think about Catcher in the Rye, here's what you need to know.

On Friday, students will be turning in their book notes, which can be written in journals. (Obviousely, you can turn in your work late. We'll talk when you return to school.)

Now after two years of thinking that soaps is a waste of time I finally come to a conclusion that it is really the best way to organize your thinking and to make sure that you include everything in your essay in order to score all the possible \"points.\" I tend to just randomly name facts as I go, mentioning the style, occasion and everything in a mix, but I think putting info in a coherent and organized manner will show the scoring person that you actually know what you are talking about, you can express in a very erudite and orderly manner and you are not just brain- storming. So my another suggestion is practice soaps, just look at some of the essay prompts on the link Thomas gave us and as you read each one of them jot down just a couple of words for SOAPS that you think you might have used if you were writing the essays at the exam.

This statement below from that article is VERY true: Popular opinion has it that students' academic success depends on the quality of their teachers and textbooks. Ask the students themselves, however, and you get a different view. Here is how they account for their academic achievement: Most students believe their ability and effort are the main reasons for school achievement. By the same token, if asked whether they would prefer to be called smart or hard-working, they will choose smart almost every time. Why? Because they believe that hard-working students risk being considered either excessively ambitious or of limited ability, both of which they would find embarrassing.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Hey does anyone know a site that I could go to that provides writing prompts or multiple choice tests. ~ Frank\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Hey Everyone, I'm having a blast here at UDUB.......I was wondering, since I missed the last three days of school, did anyone who's taking AP Lit next year get a specific \"summer reading list\" or summer work that we have to accomplish before september? ......Just curious, otherwise have an awesome summer!

When I moved up here from North Carolina, there was something different. I couldn't really describe what it was, but something in the personalities of people. There are pretty much the same restaraunts, stores and things to do around here as there are in most areas, so i could never figure out exactly what was different. Then I figured it out. It's the people. For the most part, people living in the Northwest are more \"natural.\" Like Seattle is known for being artsy, and Portland is more of a naturalist area. Also, the first thing I noticed when I moved was the California pride. I never understood what was so special about California. Maybe it was just being in middle school when everyone is trying to find themselves by bragging about everything possible, but California always came up as a bragging right. It was amazing to me how many people were like, \"well I'm from California!\" My response was always was \"your point is...?\" To this day I have yet to figure out what is so special about California. Yes, it has great weather for the most part of the year, which is more than I can say for here, but I couldn't see myself just packing up my bags and moving down there. Even given the opportunity to, I declined to move to sunny So. Cal. Which brings up a whole nother aspect of milieu. Families. You would be surprised how completely different people live. Having my mom move down to California this past summer, I was completely excited to move in with the Gilfoys. Even though they seemed like a \"normal\" family. I realized there is no \"normal\" family. (Kind of like there are no \"normal\" people, like Thomas stated.) I always thought that I just lived in the most \"interesting\" family, but every family has something different about them. After moving in with them, I have realized many small things that I love about my own family and how differently I used to live. I guess it's kind of like leaving my family a couple years early. Next year when most of you go off to college you think you will never miss your family and you're dying to get out of your house. Getting out of the house will be great, but trust me though, you will miss them and all of the small things, especially your own mother's cooking. -Rachel Penny\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Ok, this blog needs to be spiced up once again. So what did everyone think of the great and rather humorous documentary? First of all, in the film so often you'll see all the \"weird\" cultures, and the people in these communities/sect will be so proud of their culture and heritage and religious practices. To go off on Mrs.VA's commment that \"we don't see our own milieu when we are living in it\", I believe this statement to be mostly true. If a person has never moved to a different state/country, then that person will always see himself as a \"normal\" human being, because they are so immersed in their culture in which they were born. But when you move, that's when you will discover your milieu, and when you move to a drastically different place you also can more objectively see the milieu of your new home. That happened to me several times already, first the culture shock when I moved from China to California, and then I then I brought an interesting mix of Chinese/California culture when I moved up here to Vancouver Washington. Here is just a list of the many many milieus of Vancouver, if you don't realize already: 1:As Erin mentioned: \"ALL THE SUBARUS AND SUVS!!!!!!\"(this is a very interestiing discovery as I moved here, I guess even Georgia has much less SUVs) 2:Ski and Snowboarding Crazy(Go figure with all the outdoor opportunities here) 3:People drive soooooooo painfully slow and very carefully obeying the speed limit(Compare to California....You'd be kidding if you sped just 10mph above the speed limit....in California 50 mph 5 lane highway completely jammed with 80mphers) 4:People very much obey the law, the society as a whole is a lot more strict and calmer.(People very rarely question authority here, I can elaborate on that later). 5:The society's pace is soooooooooooo slow(downtown stores close before dark, what???? that's unbelievable in california) 6:I've never heard the word \"Spendy\" before I moved to Washington 7:Fast food dominates(somehow people are ok with fastfoods here) 8:All these wetlands and storm drainages(which of course the \"rain milieu\" of washington) And there are many many more.............Milieus and these subtle differences of cultures are what's so unique about every place, everyone of us......Catch a glimpse of New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Miami, Honolulu, Victoria(BC)......Wow what a range of different milieus. Too often have I heard people calling each other \"you are not normal\", or people urging me to \"just being a normal person\". But I will often ask back, \"what do you mean by NORMAL?\". \"How do you define normal????\" Because \"a normal\" human being is different in each culture/country, and you have to have a firm grasp of the milieus of that culture to be normal. Like people will always see me tapped on with Chinese culture, even if I realize it or not. And I will not try to act like everybody else just because I want to look like \"a normal person\", because THERE IS NO NORMAL PERSON, especially in America. The immigration and custom scene where people from all corners of the world feeling all patriotic and excited to become an American Citizen is simply a phenomenal picture patented for America. After all, America is a country founded on uniquenesses and differences and immigrants and we continue to pride ourselves for that. And thus in America, the world \"normal\" is moot and there is simply NO NEED FOR NORMAL! America has always to protrude out from the world as NOT BEING NORMAL!!!!!!

It was my favorite book, but I loved one and two as well and I didn't think the movies had entirely done them justice. The new one is just that; new. The new director, Alfonso Cuaron (something like that, he directed Y tu Mama Tambien) did an absolutely fabulous job making some changes that made the first movies lose a little magic (pun intended) compared to the books. For instance, robes are worn only once that I can recall, being replaced by jeans and sweaters, making the characters more comparable to the muggle adolescents in the audience. Also, Draco Malfoy, though still hateable, is now a coward in the face of confrontation. He takes on the role of a character like Wylie Coyote in the fact that he had malicious intentions, yet always ended with a frying pan bent around his face. Lastly, Pat said that it didn't always follow close to the book. Don't get it twisted\u2014 none of the story was altered, however, in the interest of time, much quidditch is subtracted in place of plot advancement, which is entirely ok, because the foreshadowing is MUCH better orchestrated than in previous movies, making it much MORE like the book in that sense.

His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of others. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes. \"From the beginning of history ,the two antagonists have stood face to face: the creator and the second-hander. The creator lives for his work. He needs no other men. His primary goal is within himself. The parasite lives second-hand. He needs others. Others become his prime motive. \"The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion. It demands total independence in function and in motive. To a creator, all relations with men are secondary. Second-hander declares that man exists in order to serve others. He preaches altruism. Altruism is the doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self. No man can live for another. \"Men have been taught dependence as a virtue. The man who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is a parasite in motive and makes parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces nothing but mutual corruption. \"Men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve, but to give. Men have been taught that it is virtue to agree with others. But the creator is the man who disagrees. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim with the current. But the creator is the man who goes against the current. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to stand together. But the creator is the man who stands alone. Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness the ideal of virtue. But the creator is the egotists in the absolute sense, and the selfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge, or act. These are functions of the self. \"The egotist in the absolute sense is not the man who sacrifices others. He is the man who stands above the need of using others in any manner. He does not function through them. He is not concerned with them in any primary matter. Not in his aim, not in his motive, not in his thinking, not in his desires, not in the source of his energy. He does not exist for any other man - and he asks no other man to exist for him. This is the only form of brotherhood and mutual respect possible between men. \"You can fake virtue for an audience. You can't fake it in you own eyes. Your ego is the strictest judge. It's easier to donate a few thousand to charity and think oneself noble than to base self-respect on personal standards of personal achievement.\" \"People are not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the second-hander's delusion - prestige. They don't say \"This is what I wanted because I wanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me.\" The only cardinal evil on earth is that of placing your prime concern within other men. If one doesn't respect oneself one can have neither love nor respect for others. \"The only thing that matters, my goal, my reward, my beginning, my end is the work itself. My work done my way. A private, personal, selfish, egotistical motivation.\" \"I never think of myself in relation to anyone. I just refuse to measure myself as part of anything.\" \"I came here to say that I do not recognize anyone's right to one minute of my life. Nor to any part of my energy. Nor to any achievement of mine. I am a man who does not exist for others. The integrity of a man's creative work is of greater importance than any charitable endeavor. I recognize no obligations toward men except one: to respect their freedom and to take no part in a slave society.\" \"Is sacrifice a virtue? Can a man sacrifice his integrity? His honor? His freedom? His ideal? His convictions? The honesty of his feelings? The independence of his thought? But these are a man's supreme possessions.

But (I'm gonna be religious here), as long as you lean on God, you should never be dissatisfied with what you have. And that's something that I struggle with, but that your essay reminded me of. So, thanks Pat. I wrote a parody, and it's not too bad. It follows these few pages in \"Their Eyes Were Watching God,\" and it's a really amazing part of the book that I wanted to try to recreate. It was hard, so I'm not sure how good my parody is. Read it, see what you think of it! But I've gotta go. All of the Junior Project stuff is do tomorrow...I should start. Bye! Bethany Mary looked up at her with hungry eyes, only wanting to listen to the unfolding story of her Mom\u2019s life. Sarah looked around as her eyes slowly took in the summer surroundings. Bees swimming drunkenly from flower to flower, the sun slowly dipping into the Puget Sound, and the gentle crash of waves on the shore. She smiled and gazed down at her patient daughter. Mary\u2019s unanticipated interest in Sarah\u2019s teenage years inspired her to tell her story. She thought of where to begin, and her eyes glanced heavenwards. The afternoon sunlight danced through the branches of the weeping willow tree and made playful shadows oh Mary\u2019s excited face. Sarah sighed with content, and decided to begin at the time when she first imagined that maybe she wasn\u2019t a little girl anymore- that maybe she was growing into something greater. She decided to tell Mary about the time she swam in the ocean at midnight. It was a warm, summer evening on Whidbey Island. Sarah had spent the evening roasting s\u2019mores over a beach fire and singing songs with her family. Every evening of that weeklong vacation, she had been on the beach. She spent every moment walking along the shore, but at night liked to listen to the waves crash on the rocks, slowly churning beach glass and barnacles into sand. The ocean called to her, like a mystery that needed to be unearthed. Not in the way that the ocean calls to a sailor, but she was mesmerized by the intense drifting current and the white foam that disappeared after only moments on the rocky shore. It inspired her. How? Why? It was like a beat lost long ago, in another time, drifting across the ocean to meet her. What? How? Why? The song of the ocean was not a real song, yet the salt sea air made her drunk to the world. It followed her through her every move, and it pleasantly haunted her dreams and thoughts. The ocean sang to her, the waves the symphony and the air its conductor. It seemed to connect her to a place or time almost unreal; her observations became acute and alive. Things that she had not noticed suddenly became vivid and momentous. They were unearthed and filled her mind and conscience. She took a few steps towards the water, admiring the sparkling rocks and glistening water. Although her father\u2019s guitar was now safely inside the cabin, the song still swayed in her mind, a friend in the warm night. Suddenly the guitar, waves, and air were all playing together in harmony; a melody so strong and inspiring yet so soft and beckoning that she could hardly contain herself. She fell against the soft sand and stared at the stars, twinkling happily in the dark sky. Why had she never noticed them before? The song of the ocean controlled her; she closed her eyes and seemed to float closer and closer towards heaven and the stars. Did the waves always make music? Did the moon always make the water sparkle like diamonds? Yes, but not for her. Tonight was her night. She felt limp and drunk with flying towards heaven and listening to earth\u2019s song. After awhile she stood up and looked across the Sound. She was seeking some sort of confirmation of her vision, her dream, her revelation. She received her answer. The water nodded its agreement, the waves roared its truth, and the stars shone in affirmation. The waves rushed over her bare feet, a usually chilling sensation that now left her smiling with indescribable warmth. She waded into the water. About to dive in, she glanced back at the cabin where here parents and siblings were sleeping. She turned around and dove into the cold water. She was seventeen! She was a dancing star and a singing wave, turning over and over in the ocean. Was the sky so joyful for her? Nothing answered. She searched the heavens, floating across the waves in the water. Looking, waiting, breathing short with impatience. She stood and looked around her; the world was made in a new light.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "The school food actually sounds like a good idea.

I was thinking a little bit about how representative the ASB is of the students\u2014 and it's basically trust on behalf of the student body that gives the governing body \"artistic license\" to run the school as it sees fit. There are no referendums, and although meetings are open to the entire student body to sit in on, nobody ever does, or probably even knows it's an option. In an effort to make my presidency more directly representative as well as continue my theme of the importance of democratic participation, I would like to have the school vote on how I should vote in the elections held this November. It would be one vote representing the entire school, and it would sacrifice my own voice, but I think mock campaigning in school for candidates at all government levels would expand the knowledge and interest in politcs of the school: a heritage that would be far more valuable than the vote I would cast on my own. With a fervor that hinges on administrative support, I would like to pursue this concept. What does everyone think? I want comments from both students and their parents on this one. But not Mike Rush, he is an ignorant Pig-Dog who deserves no respect from anyone. (Mike demanded I begin trash talking on the blog).

George Orwell's \"Homage to Catalonia\" would be good too. I read a short, interesting excerpt from it where Orwell described himself meeting an Italian peasant. A communist soldier, a simple man, and one fighting against the government of his country to fight for his beliefs. It was interesting to consider that even some Germans and Italians, whose governments were supporting Franco's Nationalist rebellion, were joining the Loyalists to fight the spread of Fascism. It's like the Domino Effect theory in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, but also like the end of that conflict, the \"villanous\" form of govt. fought against (Communist) didn't spread beyond far beyond Vietnam.

And don't blame me for spilling over that debate to this blog, but it is inevitable. Of course everyone knows that the 1st Amendments guarantees \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.......\". And then one can debate FOREVER what does that mean, either pro pledge of allegiance, the under God phrase, or opposes it. Either way, both sides can site the constitution to argue for their sides. LOL that's the beauty of our first amendment, even tho it may be concise, it's still very interpretative. And the society is sooooooooo complex that a few words in the constitution can be argued forever into future generations. As a former buddhist, and currently agnostic, to me personally, the \"Under God\" phrase doesn't offend me. But the act of conforming is. I have nothing against people saying or chanting Under God at anytime, anywhere, or under any occassion; the constitution guarantees their rights to do so. The thing that bothers me is the act of telling others what to do or not to do. How does that relate to the pledge of allegiance is the fact that little kid six years old have to say the pledge of allegiance. And did you know all the MEANING of the words in the pledge of allegiance when you were six? To me it's almost ridiculous to impose others to say what they don't even know what they are saying, and what it means......let alone believes in it. So the little kids just memorize the phrase and spew it out like robots. And that's not what America is all about..... What makes America great and the beauty of this country is the fact that it's a country of immigrants, and EVERBODY is different, and the constitution really protects the DIFFERENCE of all individuals. In fact, individualism is not only protected, but glorified and encouraged all throughout American literature from the declaration of independence and onwards. And from individualism comes with it, differences of ideas, clash of cultures, criticisms, and sometimes stuff that people don't want to hear. What bothers me is when people stop wanting to hear complaints and other points of views. Any criticism, or other radical ideas becomes BAD and immediately shuts off from debates........And everybody has to praise everybody, praise the government, praise all the institutions, all the ideas and so on. And even if you don't, you are somehow peer pressured, or forced to comply with the \"majority\" point of view. Some of America's greatest writers were critics of the time, and often deemed radicals because of their foiling of the truth......truth that the majority didn't want to admit. Like Mark Twain's Huck Finn realism style writing that foils the true life of the South from a common southern white orphan boy's point of view. (Of course it's not just happy little child pacifer literature that's all happy and good. Because the society isn't always that good). Seriously think about, what a society would be like if everyone is the same, think the same way, and all are happy with each other with no reason. Everybody would just lose their personality and the society itself will become dumber. And education is really when the clash between conformity and individualism occurs. In order to preserve the individualisms as America's embodiment, I believe that in schools, since it's a public place, the state or government should have no say in what the kids should say. The kids are just kids, they are learning and developing.........And wheh pledge of allegiance is inserted to thehir curriculum since their first day in school.....And have memorize something they don't even know what it is......it totally defeats the American character. Education is to develop people to become individuals, to become smart citizens with an critical eye, and not to turn everybody into robotic conformists.

Andrew Melon - Treasurer under the Harding administration - you know the roaring twenties were about big business and handsoff government Evan Cate can give you all the information Essay Prompts - Most answered the essay - How did the Civil Rights Movements of the 50s and 60s address the failures of reconstruction? I think you could look at supreme court decisions - Plessy V Ferguson - Brown V Board of Education Presidential Decisions - Eisenhower sent in troops, Johnson and congress supported to important pieces of legislation while Hays made deals to take the troops out. Excellent leaders and movements that addressed the issues head on...Desegregating schools, facilities, voter registration drives...all of the issues that the radical republicans wanted for the freedmen but failed to achieve...I think it is also important to think about the television and media. The movement relied on the sympathy of nonsoutherners...the television allowed for the brutality to be seen and not just told. All of these are applicable events - Brown V Board, Montgomery Bus Boycott, Little Rock Nine, Jackie Robinson, Desegregation of Military Forces, SNCC, Sit Ins, Freedom Marches, Freedom Rides, CORE, March on Washington, Stokely Carmichael, Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voters Rights Act of 1965...Remember to use events to support your point and ideas - do not describe the events. Your readers are intelligent people and describing the Montgomery Bus Boycott is insulting. How did anti - communism, the silent majority or the women's movement shape American public life.... Most NAILED the anti-communism in the fourties and fifties...you should have established the fear...Soviet Expansion, Eastern Europe, Berlin Blockade, Berlin Airlift, Truman Doctrine, Eisenhower, Korean War, Red China .... But how did it affect American Life - fear of communism and subversion - McCarhyism, HUAC, Black Lists, Bomb Shelters, NSA, NASA, Space Race, Interstate Highway system, Math and Science stressed in schools, Arms Race, Competitive with Russians... Silent Majority was a group of \"hard-working\" middle class Americans who were sick of the protests and the violence of the sixties and seventies...In support of Nixon's back to Normalcy - Good Americans, Anti - Drugs, Back to American Values....Voted in Nixon and led a stance against the chaos and hardships of the sixties and early seventies. In fact one poll believed only 11% of Americans sided with the kids at Kent State and the rest supported the Natinal Guard. - this was the hardest one... Feminist Movement - Betty Friedan - there is more to life for a woman...the birth control pill, protests at Miss American Contests...again a group met the \"establishment\" head on to make changes in the work force, at colleges, and made it acceptable for women to have a career...prior to the movment - job sector divided...changed the family units two income households and may have contributed to the divorce rates...ERA, Title 9 and Roe versus Wade...are all good things to include.

It appears that all the efforts in the sixties may have been futile because our society is segregated based on economics and race. Racial and ethnic segregation has been a phenomenon from the beggining of America's story. The Irish, Chinese, Italians, Koreans, the Russians immigrate and create communities. It seems like the etnic cultures eventually \"melt\" into mainstream society after a generation or two but people with racial differences haven't. Then their is the Native American story where they were placed in communities together for convenience and their own preservation. During the seventies there was a movement to desegregate called \"bussing\". You see an example in the Denzel Washington movie Remember the Titans. It failed miserably. Now with \"No Child Left Behind\" legislation allows for students to leave their failing school to attend another. You tell me - where would all the students from Skyview go if it failed?

Perhaps the reason that Cooper couldn't say Yeager, is that at that stage in America, we wanted to see leaders and such on TV, not someone who wants to take his time explaining about some other guy's abilities. The news people were wanting him to hurry with his explaination, and perhaps it was faster to just say himself. Also, another answer could be, that he was scared that if he didn't show confidence in his own abilities as a pilot, NASA would have chosen the guy he suggested. If the nation sees an astronaut reccommend that he is not the best pilot, they would be upset that he is flying a space craft their tax dollars went into creating; they would want someone who is ready to go into space. I think that the main point of this film was to show that during the Cold War, personal victories boosted the nation's morale. For a very large portion of the nation, breaking the sound barrier meant nothing or little to them. Yet the media played this off as some great event. While sending 1 person into space was a landmark event for the US, it became more and more dramatized each time... everytime a new astronaut went up, they \"pushed the envelope farther than before.\" But each time they orbited the earth a few more times than before, it was made out to be an enormous event. This surprised me, because if I was living back then, I don't think I'd care if someone went two more times around the Earth than the person before him. I think the directors were trying to show that maybe some events during the Cold War were made out to be bigger than they actually were.

Aside from the brief period of time after 9/11, I don't think I've ever felt the sort of American comradery and patriotism that appeared in The Right stuff. The homage paid to the test pilot was a little time consuming, but touching to see Yager continue to risk his life because it was his job and what he liked to do even if it were overshadowed by the space race.

Throughout the movie the wives of the to be astronauts were depicted as obedient to their husbands even if this was not in compliance with their personal feelings. The prime example of such characterization was demonstrated in the scene where the astronauts were being interviewed by the press and the question arose of how the astronaut's wives felt about their husbands going into space. In response, all the astronauts replied that their spouses supported them 100% in their pursuit towards space, when this clearly was not the case for all of the wives. Finally, one aspect of the film that stemmed away from the stereo typical gender roles was the relationship between Alan Sheppard and his wife. When urged by his superiors to tell his wife to speak with the press/vice-president, Sheppard disregards this pressure, and supports the wishes of his wife to be sheltered from the invasion of the press/media.

But just in case... if you're in 6th period, or the other AP period, I hope you remember the Holocaust/Hiroshima discussions we had. I came across a story in the New York Times about a village in Italy attempting to prosecute some former Nazi SS members. If this piques your interest, you can read the story here; http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/international/europe/18TUSC.html?th . The question it asks is, is the world ready to forgive the Nazis?

Love, Rob\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Ok, with the approval of Ms.Clark, I would like to ask everyone your opinions on the impending possibility of a draft. Here is a urlLink great article that introduces a glimpse of the growing probability of a draft I didn't know that our country has 1.44 MILLION TROOPS stationed in 141 countries. Why would we want to police the whole world? And given the result of the past few days, the miserable situations our armed forces got into in Iraq, the situation seems somewhat scary. And I know it's inevitable, but Rumsfeld's decision to keep the soldiers there for 90-120 days more is an act that would further degrade the morale of the army, after already almost all of the frontline soldiers have been put on suicide watch. And here is an article from CNN that accounts for the Bi-Partisan support in congress for the draft CHARLES RANGEL Democratic Congressman from New York and Korean War vet Staying the course in Iraq means increasing our troop strength, and, not surprisingly, recruitment and re-enlistment levels are down. But proposed enlistment bonuses and other economic incentives will not make the military any more attractive to upper-middle-class young people. Increasingly we will be a nation in which the poor fight our wars while the affluent stay home. To correct the disparity among those who serve, South Carolina Senator Fritz Hollings and I have proposed a new draft. All men and women ages 18 to 26 would be eligible for induction once they have completed high school. Those not needed in the military would perform civilian service. Enacting our plan would democratize our armed forces and return to the \"citizen soldier\" ideal that has served our nation so well. As a veteran, I strongly believe that fighting for our country must be fairly shared by all racial and economic groups. Nobody wants to go to war, but the burden of service cannot fall only on volunteers who, no matter how patriotic, are attracted to the military for financial reasons. We cannot continue to pretend it is fair that one segment of society makes all the sacrifices. CHARLES MOSKOS Professor of sociology at Northwestern University and a former draftee Our country is facing new kinds of threats and needs a new kind of draft. Even before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, our military was severely overstretched in fulfilling its missions. But more important, we have done nothing serious about homeland defense in the war against terrorism. We need guards for our nuclear power plants, dams and public facilities. We have done little to create the necessary border patrollers, customs agents and cargo-ship inspectors. Short-term draftees, under professional supervision, could perform these duties admirably. It takes less than four months to train a military police officer\u2014precisely the kind of role most needed in peacekeeping missions and guard duties. This would free up professional soldiers, and it would stop the unprecedented activation of reservists. Their multiple tours have led to demoralization and impending recruitment shortfalls. We must institute a three-tiered draft system in America, with 15-to-24-month tours of duty for citizens ages 18 to 26. In the new-style draft, conscripts could serve in the military, in homeland security or in a civilian-service program like AmeriCorps\u2014and there is no reason women could not be drafted for the latter categories JAMES INHOFE Republican Senator from Oklahoma I think I'm the only member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who would reinstate the draft. There are huge social benefits that come from it. I can assure you I would not be in the U.S. Senate today if I had not gone through the draft. When I look at the problems of some of our kids in America nowadays and then I go visit the troops, I see what a great benefit it is to give people the opportunity to serve their country. I was drafted into the Army in January 1957 and served two years as an enlisted man. I gained a new outlook on life through the rigors of basic training. The military can have a more intense influence on soldiers when they are drafted and have no choice. I developed a sense of patriotism through the experience of serving my country.

The \"Third\" then meant the third way .

Has anyone seen Hiroshima Mon Amour? It's an old film by Alain Resnais that begins with footage from the Hiroshima devastation and ties it to a woman's past experiences in WWII. It's been a while since I've seen it, but it might be a good view as it reveals the impact (pun intended) of the war on both Europeans and the Japanese. It is beautiful in its portrayal of the devastation of war. It's very 'art' and I think subtitled. Massive wonk points. It has taken me many years to begin to see past the mechanics of history and foreign policy down to impact that this history has on people. In junior and high school, I was an avid student of WWII. I read books like PT-109, Guadalcanal Diary, et. al. made models of WWII airplanes. I even had an amazingly complex board game in which you could replicate almost any battle in the war. It was all VERY geeky in retrospect. I'm sure part of this fascination was due to my mother's experiences in the war as a Finnish refugee and the fact that she and I would watch the BBC documentary World at War. But as a child, the war was fascinating because of the things, places, and 'stuff of war.' Thomas' comment about the complexity of the issue of dropping the bomb is telling. Up until 9/11, non-combatant Americans never had to deal with the war on their own soil. The WWII experiences among an average European, American, or Hiroshima resident could not be more different. As a child refugee during WWII, my mother often had no food. Some Finns ate the bark off birch trees for nourishment. Her father was killed within the first few weeks of the conflict. As the oldest child, she became an erstatz father at age 12. Sugar was the least of her worries. I never really appreciated this very real history when I was young. History and war were either subjects of grudging study or something that I read in a book. After travelling, college study, and some sporadic personal growth, I look at history very differently now. I'm not saying that's better or worse, but my reading of history is now reflected through a desire to see it both from 'the big picture' and from the viewpoint of the human beings that are part of it. It makes history far more complex, messy, and ambiguous. As an example, my mom was 'the enemy' in WWII. When the Finns sided with the Germans in '42 to attempt to regain the land that had been taken when Russia (our ally) invaded Finland, they became part of the Axis Powers. The Finns lost twice in WWII. Because of the Molotov/Ribbentrop Pact, they lost their land to the Russians and were forced to pay reparations to the US and other allies for siding with the Nazis. (My mom was very proud that the Finns were the only Axis nation to pay every cent of their 'debt' to the U.S. despite not receiving any of the aid given to Japan or Germany.) Despite the fact that my mother's heritage and former home is more Russian than Finnish, she strongly distrusted and disliked Russians until she developed Alzheimers. Now she loves everyone.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I don't know what the next topic is. We just took a test, so we haven't gotten to cover anything...

It's not like we have a bible in our hands, knocking on people's doors and preaching to them about their horrible sins. We're not Puritans! That seems to be the stereotype that some may see whenever someone else uses morals as their base of their opinion. Whether it comes to Gay marraige, or abortion, y'all probably know where I stand on those issues... or do you? You see, I don't mind abortion being legal, but I wouldn't use it. Even if I do have an \"accident\" and get pregnant, however that may work. And it's not like I'm rich and have a lot of money, so I'm priveledged enough that I can say that I can handle having a child. I would be dead broke, dropping out of school, getting a job, compromising with my parents, handling their disappointment... and so on with the negatives of teen pregnancy. AND STILL, I would have the child and either keep it, or give it up for adoption... making sure FOR MYSELF that it goes to two wonderful parents who can give the child opportunities that I wouldn't be able to provide. But you know, all that would go away if only I aborted the child. But (again, using my morals OMG) I wouldn't, I couldn't, I value the life that I created too much. But this is all a hypothetical situation guys, don't worry I'm not pregnant. And I won't get pregnant til I marry, because I have that much control over that situation. But go ahead and keep abortion, because others feel that it's needed. Now was I using a bible to defend my reasons? A lot of people who think to the right don't. When it comes to the Gay Marraige issue, I'm not homophoebic and I'm not going to shove a bible people's faces, but I don't recognize marraige of homosexuals as the same union as I would a marraige between heterosexuals. It's not the same, and it's not for reasons of what people do in the bedroom. It's much more than that, especially when there are children involved. And Rob, to give you a reason as to why I think it's wrong... it's because I believe that homosexual marraige isn't something that God designed. The design was for a man and a woman to have the marraige of holy matrimony. But to a secularist, I guess that doesn't matter. They don't use morals as the base of their opinion. They have to use facts, reasons and \"imperical data\" to share their beliefs, and in turn, they're viewed as the \"smarter\" people. Don't lie. I know the reasons why students who are viewed to be the smart ones are viewed that way. It's because they're left-winged/secularists who use data up the ying-yang to prove their point.

It makes me feel bad that some people say I'm intolerant of their views when in reality they are intolerant of my views. I don't hate homosexuals, I just don't agree with them. I don't hate those who choose abortion, I just don't agree with using it. What I'm trying to say is that I want to take down the idea that right-winged, conservatives aren't open people.

I know Ms. Clark is trying to get us to talk about a new issue, but bare with me. I understand all sides of the different arguments that have been presented, so i commend all of you for putting your ideas out there. I think the arguments that are clearly stuck in my head are Rob's (with the hope of rallying up support for the blond hair blue eyed heterosexual caucasian white males), Natalya's (arguing on both GM and EC) and Megan's. Maybe its because i agree with a lot of what they have said. Unlike Megan, i dont know many homosexuals, however my heart does go out to them. But I do realize that i dont have the same religious background as others that could hinder my sympathy for them. I still am pushing that there is a definite separation between church and state. This should be remembered when arguing whether or not GM should be legalized. I know i posted a week ago, and it's so far back in the past that im sure it has been forgotten, but i said a lot of what Natalya said, just not as eloquently (she is of course an experienced debater!). I agree completely with her arguments, particularly on the debate over abortion and EC. I know people have moral reasons for not agreeing with its usage, however mistakes happen. It isnt fair to put an innocent child in an unforgiving world. No matter what opportunities are trying to be given to make up for lower-income, hard lives, the pain inside cannot be erased. They are brought into the world unwanted, permanently branded. And i agree, it is up to each individual to make their own decision. Being a fairly independent female, it scares me to death to know that the option may not always be open to me. Accidents happen. I know that i wouldnt want one bad decision to effect me, my unborn child, my family, and the father of the child (considering rape isnt involved). Each decision has repercussions, effecting not only one individual, but all those who surround him/her. I'll admit it now: I am pro-choice on pretty much every aspect of social controversy. I dont think it is acceptable for a group of individuals, no matter what their backgrounds or personal beliefs may be, to make decisions that effect the masses. There are always instances where people should just have the right to make their own decisions, b/c in the long run, each individual knows what is best for himself/herself. Addressing the idea of whether or not abortion or gay marriage should be reason to sway one's vote, i think its up to the individual.Unfortunately, i will not be 18 for the coming election and thus i cant say that i can answer the question without a little cynicism, knowing that it doesnt effect me for another 4 years. But i do think that it is worth researching and looking into. I think it's important to research all of the different positions each candidate is taking, economically, their domestic policies, and foreign policies. I dont think it would be wise to make the decision solely on one aspect of their campaigns. Basically, it's choosing the lesser evil. I dont think anyone will ever completely agree with all the prospective policies, but its choosing which one you have lesser opposition to. Well, i hope i have covered all all the topics that have been discussed over the past week. But bare with me if i havent, a lot of ground was covered between now and the last time i posted!

I have to say that although I take hardsides and are extreme sometimes, I think that it's disrepctful to call other people flatly wrong. Political issues will never have a complete 100% right or wrongs. Yeah so there! On to the gay marriage debate, I will have to side with hardline pro-gay coalitions forces. Rob's article lets you have a glimpse of the emotional traumas and unexplicable sorrows and guilts gay people already have in their minds that they cannot communicate. Much of it of course caused by the phobias from society. Most gays have gone through (or are going through) constant fear of discriminations from the society already. These frivolous fear of gays (WITHOUT ANY SINGLE SCIENTIFIC BASIS!) are simply baseless and are simply stemming from the conformist stereotypical mainstream society's view. Denying the gays the right to marry (for they probably have more love and less like to divorce anyways) simply manifests itself from subtle stereotypical view towards gays, even if you don't want to admit it. Discriminating against gays is completely analogus to any other form of discrimination of any RACE, or even GENDER. Just because they physically look different, act different, think differently DOES NOT make them inferior. ONLY a criminal would do so. This great nation generously help the disabled, and the mentally retarded. We have special access, special privileges, and special facillities for these people so they can have the same opportunities as everybody else. And besides that gays are as intelligent and as abled in every intellectual as straights. Any supposedly \"disabled\" abilities of gays are purely the result of social pressure and phobias. If we do do our best helping disabled , why not help gay people achieve equality too? And of course everyone knows that disabled and mentally retarded people are that way because of nature(They didn't become disabled because it's cool to!) and there should be no denial into the genetic factors behind gays, AND so WHY favor some biogenetic factor over others??

(Ferg is gonna hate me for this but) Take the Civil War for example. The 13th ammendment freed the slaves, the 14th protected them in the courts, the 15th let them vote. Although gays haven't been forced into labor and don't need emancipation, the next step is to protect their rights. Last year there were 2051 reported hate crimes based on sexual preference, up 8% from the number in 2002. Along with protecting gay civil rights, the advancement of homosexuals will hopefully reduce the very negative anti-gay sentiment (whether conscious or not) in this country. Kolk, you give me a good reason why gays don't have the right to marry and I'll either tell you why you're wrong, or apologize profusely.

Why The M Word Matters To Me Only marriage can bring a gay person home By ANDREW SULLIVAN Feb. 16, 2004 As a child, I had no idea what homosexuality was. I grew up in a traditional home \u2014 Catholic, conservative, middle class. Life was relatively simple: education, work, family. I was raised to aim high in life, even though my parents hadn't gone to college. But one thing was instilled in me. What mattered was not how far you went in life, how much money you earned, how big a name you made for yourself. What really mattered was family and the love you had for one another. The most important day of your life was not graduation from college or your first day at work or a raise or even your first house. The most important day of your life was when you got married. It was on that day that all your friends and all your family got together to celebrate the most important thing in life: your happiness \u2014 your ability to make a new home, to form a new but connected family, to find love that put everything else into perspective. But as I grew older, I found that this was somehow not available to me. I didn't feel the things for girls that my peers did. All the emotions and social rituals and bonding of teenage heterosexual life eluded me. I didn't know why. No one explained it. My emotional bonds to other boys were one-sided; each time I felt myself falling in love, they sensed it, pushed it away. I didn't and couldn't blame them. I got along fine with my buds in a nonemotional context, but something was awry, something not right. I came to know almost instinctively that I would never be a part of my family the way my siblings might one day be. The love I had inside me was unmentionable, anathema. I remember writing in my teenage journal one day, \"I'm a professional human being. But what do I do in my private life?\" I never discussed my real life. I couldn't date girls and so immersed myself in schoolwork, the debate team, school plays, anything to give me an excuse not to confront reality. When I looked toward the years ahead, I couldn't see a future. There was just a void. Was I going to be alone my whole life? Would I ever have a most important day in my life? It seemed impossible, a negation, an undoing. To be a full part of my family, I had to somehow not be me. So, like many other gay teens, I withdrew, became neurotic, depressed, at times close to suicidal. I shut myself in my room with my books night after night while my peers developed the skills needed to form real relationships and loves. In wounded pride, I even voiced a rejection of family and marriage. It was the only way I could explain my isolation. It took years for me to realize that I was gay, years more to tell others and more time yet to form any kind of stable emotional bond with another man. Because my sexuality had emerged in solitude \u2014 and without any link to the idea of an actual relationship \u2014 it was hard later to reconnect sex to love and self-esteem. It still is. But I persevered, each relationship slowly growing longer than the last, learning in my 20s and 30s what my straight friends had found out in their teens. But even then my parents and friends never asked the question they would have asked automatically if I were straight: So, when are you going to get married? When will we be able to celebrate it and affirm it and support it? In fact, no one \u2014 no one \u2014 has yet asked me that question. When people talk about gay marriage, they miss the point. This isn't about gay marriage. It's about marriage. It's about family. It's about love. It isn't about religion. It's about civil marriage licenses. Churches can and should have the right to say no to marriage for gays in their congregations, just as Catholics say no to divorce, but divorce is still a civil option. These family values are not options for a happy and stable life. They are necessities. Putting gay relationships in some other category \u2014 civil unions, domestic partnerships, whatever \u2014 may alleviate real human needs, but by their very euphemism, by their very separateness, they actually build a wall between gay people and their families. They put back the barrier many of us have spent a lifetime trying to erase. It's too late for me to undo my past. But I want above everything else to remember a young kid out there who may even be reading this now. I want to let him know that he doesn't have to choose between himself and his family anymore. I want him to know that his love has dignity, that he does indeed have a future as a full and equal part of the human race. Only marriage will do that. Only marriage can bring him home.

With all of the hype concerning this book and input from others who have read, I was excpecting a great book that would address controversial issues of religious history. The book failed to meet the standards I had set, and completely let me down. It actually turned out to be the most annoying book I have ever read. First of all the author, Dan Brown, used all kinds of foreshadowing trying to keep you stuck on the book. He would hint on subjects or different happening that wouldn't actually take place until 4 chapters after comment. So as I read I would try to concentrate on the matters before me but I constantly had the thought of his foreshadowing in my mind. So I could not put the book down, and usually people use that phrase to descirbe a book that really interests them but in this case I just needed to find out the stupid answers to the stupid questions. By the time I found the answer or I reach the happenstance that had been revealed tens of pages beforehand, I would now have experienced more of the same types of comments and the vicious cycle would restart. I know that this kind of writing is common but I think the author really overused its use and it started to get on my nerves. I guess that means Dan Brown is a good writer because however conniving his tactics, I could not put the book down. Another problem I had with this is finding the difference between fact and fiction. There were some very interesting ideas posed but I would like to see justification for some of the statements made because the only way they would be cool is if they were true.

Before women choose to have an abortion they should realize and understand its effects on their body. However, this is America, one of the few places on Earth were people can live freely. Therefore to deny a person the right to choose what to do with her own body goes against what we as Americans stand for. One issue that really itches me is what role should fathers play in abortion?

Also, I think that the \"slippery slope\" argument is stupid. Just because I see two women getting married on TV, I'm not going to go out demanding all kinds of other pointless things like the right to marry my cat. And as for abortion: while the idea of killing babies (or fetuses that could potentially be wonderful people someday) really bothers me, I don't think that I have the right to tell my friend that they can't have an abortion. It was interesting because I went into class set on the opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade, and left class with the opinion I just stated. Finally, the fat kids. I really don't know what to think. On one hand, I think that taxing junk food is a little extreme. But on the other hand, children are ridiculously occupied with Doritos and Halo, and do absolutely NOTHING. But how could the government take a role? They obviously attempt to control what is being served in schools and make it nutritious, it just as obviously doesn't work (look at Skyview's menu). P.E. classes are ineffective. And the government, while they can run things like schools, shouldn't be allowed to dictate what people eat at home.

America's middle class has been shrinking, and will continue to shrink while the lower class grows and upward mobility stalls.

Since these are both government imposed and our government is secular and thus should take no cues from religious authorities, I think gays should be allowed to marry. If the word marry bothers people too much, I wouldn't be too opposed to changing the official term to civil unions for everyone and making marriage a religious only institution. Maybe we could get 'civil unionized' at the justice of the peace, but married at a church, and the churches could decide to not let gays 'marry' perse but they could still reap the financial benefits and official representation from a 'civil unionization'. Or we could just get it overwith and let the gay people marry. It's going to happen eventually, why put up such a fight?\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I personally think its wrong, better yet \"morally wrong\" to impose your morals on any other person or a group of people, that is concerning gay marriages and abortion. I mean if religious people believe that abortion is wrong no one forces them to have it, but they can't hinder other people in their choice to have abortion. There is lot of idealistic talk around here, especially saying that the problem would be solved if people simply stopped having sex, but the fact is human instincts often take over reason and a lot of people don't even see anything wrong with having sex. The question then is how we can help those people that do have \"accidents\" and are irresponsible. I heard a lot of people say that instead of being aborted the child should be given to foster care, which I think is even greater irresponsibility. It's irresponsible to throw away your child once you gave life to her/him, abortion in a way is taking responsibility of your actions; once that child is in the foster care you will never know what kind of a life that child will have, whether he/she will be abused, sexually harassed or simply have an unhappy life knowing that he/she was an unwanted child, thrown into the world as a homeless dog. Many say that there are a lot of couples that simply dream adopting cute little babies and providing them with a wonderful life, but there are lot of kids in foster care around the world and all of them in no way possible will have enough couples to be adopted by. Anyway, I think the pill is one of the most important innovations in history of womankind, it eliminates that dead end of either having abortion or giving birth and then giving up that precious life to the \"cruel and perilous world.\" Concerning gay marriages, Rob has voiced my opinion in the best way possible. Afterall this is America... my country tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I sing. So shouldn't we all have the right to love and to live our lives happily as we wish to as long as we don't harm anyone else. I mean do you become physically or mentally harmed if you see a married homosexual couple? What goes on in their bedroom is of no ones business but theirs, and I think who should be of more concern are the preachers who vigorously preach about homosexuality as a sin and a \"morally wrong doing\" and then go an have \"fun\" with their own little \"buddies\" seven years old, sick.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I think everyone in this blog is missing the point of emergency contraception. It does NOT cause an abortion. Because that fact seems to get so easily confused, let me explain how pregnancy and conception work. After intercourse that ends in ejaculation, sperm cells may live in the very hospitable environment of the vagina for about 5 days. If there are sperm still living in the vagina during the time of ovulation it is very probable that a pregnancy will occur. What the morning after pill does is prevent the egg from being released therefore preventing pregnancy or prevent a fertilized egg from implantation in the uterus where it would THEN begin to mature. This IS NOT an abortion! With that logic, everyone that takes the birth control is instigating one indefinately long abortion, which they clearly are not doing. Furthermore, the point of emergency contraception is not to be a primary source of birth control in the first place. A fully functioning condom used properly is more effective than EC, but sometimes the condom comes off, breaks, or \"little spermies get out\" for whatever reason, opening the door to an unwanted pregnancy by responsible sex-havers. Another scenario is a rape/date-rape situation where sex was not planned. It is unfair to the rape victim as well as the bastard child that results from the unwanted pregnancy. Lastly, I know there will be a situation in which one of these bloggers will get caught up in the passionate moment and omit protection. I'm not excusing irresponsibility, but why risk the pregnancy if there is a safe, non-abusable form of contraception that could eliminate the unwanted consequence? It's fine to criticize EC's use from a seperated vantage, but wait until you or your partner is panicking because the condom broke, and try to tell me you wouldn't want an easily available solution that ultimately PREVENTS abortion if that is the last resort for an unwanted pregnancy. I honostly don't see where a debate against this medication stems from other than ignorance, but consider yourselves educated now. The only safe sex is abstinence...

I think if people think they are responsible to have sex, then they should be responsible enough to use protection. I know condoms aren't always 100% effective and sometimes little sperm-ies get out, but if you are responsible enough to have sex, you have to be responsible enough to deal with the consequences, whatever they might be. I think some people use abortion and the morning after pill as a form of birth control after they have had sex, rather then using birth control before or during. If you aren't ready to have kids, then you aren't ready for sex. I think if people weren't so caught up on acting older then they are, we wouldn\u2019t have to have this talk about whether abortion should be legal or not, because there wouldn\u2019t be a high number of unwanted pregnancies.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Wow, it is nice to see all of the debate going on and it is nice to see everyone's different views. Rob, congratulations on the longest, most well-constructed blog in the history of blogger. The current debate topic of abortion and birth-control seems to manifest a rift between morals and science. The problem now is to recognize the difference and form opinions/arguments. Chris is certainly right-on when he talks of the moral similarities between taking the morning-after pill and an abortion. However, as the morals are similar, the science and event of each are so drastically different that it separates the moral argument on a scientific level. I would say that it would be much more demoralizing for a woman, perhaps her boyfriend and parents as well, to go through a surgical abortion. If taking a pill after sex allows a girl to not have to go through with an abortion this then reduces a life-changing experience to a gulp...And a swallow. Therefore, the repercussions of each event and the moral affect that those repercussions have, separate the two. ~Holla\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Hey all, I don't mean to light the fire for a debate but I don't have a problem with abortion, and I don't see how abortion and the morning after pill differ in purpose of use. Whats the difference between stopping something thats going to exist than ceasing something that barely does. A pregnancy is the process of producing a baby, once a mommy and a daddy have sex and the sperm meets the egg that process begins. Whether a person recognizes the possibility of a baby earlier or later, the possibility and probability of a baby are the same in both situations. If one has to use the morning after pill to stop the inevitability of a baby growing, then it is obvious that the person taking the pill beleives that a baby has been conceived, and wishes to cancel that conception. Cancelling the conception is taking the possibility of existence away from that baby. Now how does that differ from abortion? Due to that, I don't see how people can justify their negative views on abortion while supporting the morning after pill. When it comes down to it, both methods of ending a pregnancy are ways out for people who are not ready to become parents. And it is my personal opinion that a way out three days after conception does not differ from that of 3 weeks. -I love you guys, Chris Mitchem\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I'm going to kind of answer my own question about what people's opinions are of the morning after pill, because I never really did answer it myself. For some reason, I really do not consider it to be abortion. Because you can only take it up to three days after you've had intercourse, and you also at that point have no way of knowing if you're pregnant, so I don't consider it taking a life. As Rob said (or maybe Ms. Clark said it, I can't remember), the morning after pill is much more of a form of birth control than an abortion tool. Abortion is a deliberate choice to take a babies' life in it's (sometimes) later forms of developement, while the morning after pill is simply a safety net. As for the gay marriage issue...this issue is extremely sticky to get around. I personally, partly because of my religious background, think that being gay is morally wrong. However, we live in America. Here we are supposed to be able to have the freedom to do as we please, get the job we want, eat what food we want, and marry who we want. It then becomes an issue of how far the government is going to get into Americans personal lives and try to take control. Do they really have the right to say that you can't marry who you want to just because it's morally wrong? Perhaps that's stepping in too far, but then I get into a conflict with my own morals of gay marriage being sinful according to the Bible. Most of you probably don't know that in the United Methodist Church in the past few months, one of their pastors has openly admitted to being gay and having a lifetime partner. They went to Portland and got married recently also. Well, needless to say that opened up a HUGE problem within the church. Not only the question of whether God thinks it's right to be gay or not, but also does the church want a gay person to be able to preach? After a very drawn out trial (which is still being protested and debated) the Church decided that the pastor would still be allowed to preach. Up until recently, I hadn't seriously thought about how much GM would effect and divide our country. But just thinking about it from that one light opens up so many controveresies, and many more that are most likely to come. It's such a vast discussion, and it can't be talked about with people's personal feelings and morals coming into play. The madness of the world today...

The morning after pill or emergency contraception either prevents an egg from being released, or creates an unhospitable environment in the uterus to prevent implantation the same way that birth control pills, shots, and patches work.

I repeat, the morning after pill DOES NOT abort a pregnancy and there are plenty of on-line resources to back that up. The pill is useful for unplanned intercourse including rape or condom breakage. Studies show no harmful side effects, but unfortunately, the FDA decided (against surgeon general recommendation) that emergency contraception not be sold over-the-counter because of the lack of specific directions for use.

I single out the Catholics because they are the only group I know of that has discouraged the use of birth control- which is all the morning after pill is. It has the same chemical that a birth control pill does, and the same effect, just a double the dose of a weekly or monthly pill that interferes with the release, or implantation of an egg after unprotected sex. It DOES NOT abort a pregnancy which is a common misconception. The real problem with the morning after pill is that it is not an over-the-counter medication. It is not marketed as a replacement for a condom or other contraceptive, but rather a substance that can be taken in an emergency. Plain and simple, if the morning after pill becomes more easily accessable, abortion rates decrease. Now on to the debate we had friday on gay marriage... why arguments against gay marriage (GM) don't work (many arguments against gay marriage overlap and I'm going to refute all that I can recall, but possibly not in the most organizationally logical, but bear with me); Civil Unions: The fourteenth ammendment declares any law abridging rights illegal and Brown vs. Board (fifty years ago last week) declared separate unequal. Allowing gays to marry does not detract at all from heterosexual marriages, I'll get to that later. Religion: Besides the obvious Church and State separation, I'd like to challenge those who claim that their only opposition to GM is because God finds it immoral. The only verses where the Bible expressly declares homosexuality sinful is in Leviticus, however, also in Leviticus there are laws forbidding mules, clothing made of more than one material, and the consumption of shellfish. Even the most pious of midwestern farmers use mules, the devoutest of New York Irish-Catholics wear spandex, and the most faithful of Southern Baptists eat Louisiana oysters. So why is the law forbidding homosexuality still relevant while so many Christians across the country would be burning pigeons, rams or bulls for atonement every day? It is unfair to God, unfair to oneself, and unfair to homosexuals to be hypocritical in ones faith. Lastly, there is no law forcing religious institutions to accept state-issued marriage certificates. I know that I will not convince many to disregard a good portion of the Old Testament, but none should argue that universally legalizing GM infringes upon their religious beliefs. Legalizing GM sets dangerous precedents. AKA, the \"slippery slope\" issue: This argument suggests that there is something wrong with homosexuality in the first place. That because heterosexuals can never comprehend its biological intricacies homosexuality is therefore immoral or wrong. Some would argue that legalizing GM encourages homosexuality- to that I ask what is wrong with that? Never mind the intended rhetoric of that question, the real contention is that homosexuality has been around since the beginning of time and will continue to stick around long after an ammendment to ban GM. Others would say that gays don't hold the institution of marriage is the same esteem as heteros, but I would argue that they hold it higher. Marriage is something that this group has to fight for. A rite of maturity and consecration that has been to this point forbidden to them. George W. Bush has proposed an ammendment banning GM as part of his Marriage Protection platform. I would ask the president to explain why, after two years as Governor of Texas, divorce rates in his states jumped up 6% after a steady decline over the last 25 years. Gays can create the same environment of dependence and stability that the state provides benefits for. Those who suggest that GM promotes infidelity, insincincerity, or various other ins promotes the very KKK/neo-Nazi idea that gays are inferior, as well as the perpetuation of the hate and discrimination that results. Lastly, there is another argument that gay marriage opens the door to marriage to animals, or polygamy. Marriage, ideally, is the manifestation of a commitment made in love. Historically this has not been the case in heterosexuals when arranged marriages to expand fortunes and empires have been abused by straight royalty and peasantry as long as time remembers, and although that history has faded out, I see no reason as to why the commitment of two people in love has to be expanded to animals whom the law could successfully argue do not share the human emotion ideally involved in a marriage. As for polygamy, I see no problem with it. I have had first-hand accounts with personal friends of polygamists in Utah. While the state doesn't recognize their marriage, the man of the house (so to speak) commits himself to each of his wives, supports his children, and the members of the family receive the benefit of an environment much healthier than that of an abusive or neglectful albeit \"normal\" household. My conclusion to the arguments against GM is that in many cases they are the manifestation of an instinctual reflex against homosexuality. I won't deny the fact that witnessing two males kiss does not sit well with me, but that is no reason to punish those, who for whatever reason, are physically attracted to the same sex. If anyone wants to challenge my statements or add to my list of arguments to refute, I gladly accept the confrontation. A metric plethora of people have claimed that GM is such a frivolous issue to get so passionate about, and on the first layer, I believe they are right. But this argument is not just about GM; it's another pinnacle of the continuing struggle minorities have for equality in this America so proud of its Land of the Free. Think about it.

On the issue of abortion, what do you all think of the \"Morning After\" pill? I was talking to Bethany about it today, and I was just wondering if any of you had any imput on the issue. Oh, and here's a random piece of info, for those of you who said that no one would want to adopt African Americans, or that the majority of the poor women who get abortions are black: The amount of black women who get abortions is half of that of white women. Black women actually have hugely decreased the amounts of abortions, and the reason behind it is because the African American Baptist Church has gotten so involved in enforcing abstinence.

We formed two groups, with one watching and the other debating, and it went pretty well. But it was hard, because we all wanted to hear everyone's ideas, but with so many people and only 45 minutes, most of us only got to talk once. The MUN kids in our class are INSANE, spouting off random facts that are somehow relevant to what we're discussing. If only we were all that smart...but, I've gotta be honest Thomas (and don't get heated), but I think that your issue on abortion in 3rd World Countries belongs in a completely different discussion. Maybe I just don't know enough about Bush's policy, but I don't see how that effects the subject of our discussion on Friday. And, for those of you who think that morals shouldn't be involved in deciding whether abortion should be legalized or not, I think that's impossible. For example, I believe that no baby should be killed, but that if the mother has no way of taking care of the baby, that adoption is the best thing for it. But someone else will feel differently, that the fetus isn't yet a person or that the mother has the right to kill or keep her baby. That's a difference in morals and personal beliefs. There's no way to take a stand on an issue like this without including your own morals. Issues like abortion and gay marriage are built completely on personal opinions and cannot be decided in any other way. PS I'm not anti-choice, I'm anti-death! :) See you all on Monday.

For the abortion issue, I continue to stress the fact that whatever the case, the ultimate responsibility comes down to taking care of the child, whether it's parental care, adoptions, or fostercare. I dissagree with the fact that any living cell is somehow given the chance to become a genius and those wonderful dreams are innately possessed in the process. It's simply not true. It's simply a wild dream to think a living cell born to a perfectly dangerous and alien society would be expected to grow up healthily or EVEN SURVIVE THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY STILL HAVE NOT OPPENED THEIR EYELIDS.........hhhmmmmmm maybe that's why infant mortality rates in third world countries are as high as 50%! Or half of the babies don't make it through the first two years of their lives. Hmmmmmmm how IRRESPONSIBLE are we then....how many more babies are killed and what's the strain on the society then. And that's not already taking into account the risk of lives the mothers have to go through bearing the child and raising the child up under extreme hostile situations. I have to agree completely with how Bush's actions of punishing foreign country clincs that give out abortions would only hurt the destitute third world societies and does nothing to educate and prevent these kind of situations from happening again. The truth is, in the majority of 3rd world countries, and as a singlet example, SE Asia's Cambodia, sexual exploitations is extremely rampant (more rampant than anything you've ever imagined that could happen). Such poor countries. People younger than us would be SOLD BY THEIR PARENTS for prostitutes because the families are simply sooooo poor. And for us it is easy to \"hey you have to understand the consequence of sex\" and that, but many destitute people in third world countries PEOPLE SIMPLY DON\"T KNOW AND HAVE NEVER HAD THE EDUCATION FOR THAT. EDUCATION and the corresponding higher level of social-economic status is the KEY for woman to make wise decisions. Education is the key for elevating the traditional degrading and subhuman status of woman in many third world countries. Thus, instead of withdrawing aids and funds from foreign clinics where abortions are performed, it's an opportunity for us to show our egalitarian American values and try to put more aids into education programs, and more aids so more people can lift out of poverty situations. Yeah an thus, I think that abortion should be upheld simply looking at the world with reality......And of course if you are educated and wise and know how to make the choice, GOOD FOR YOU (you are extremely lucky and should be proud of yourself of not ever having the need for abortion), but for millions of others around the country and around the world.......There is a long long long way to go to create a perfect utopian society...... As for the childhood obesity debate, we'll see on Monday. I also want to comment on the gay marriage issue here. The compromise for both sides would be civil union protections for at least basic liberties so gay people are not constantly in a state of fear and constantly being prejudiced. And ultimately, I believe that they should enjoy the exact same liberties and opportunities any other person enjoys. Because ultimately, people CAN biologically be gay. To deny gay people the same rights all other citizens enjoy would be like degrading disabled, mentally retarded, or even a minority race of people.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Hey, what's up?

My decision is based on the constitutionality: our country takes pride in the freedoms we are guranteed as American citizens, many of which we take advantage of daily. However, with the Civil Rights Act of 1960, it is unconstitutional to descriminate based on race, national origin, or SEX (which for me, includes sexual preference). How can we stand by our constitution and the freedoms it gives us if it is not used to give these freedoms equally to ALL citizens? Along with that, even since the first colonists, separation from church and state has been established. Thus, even if it is morally wrong based on your religious creed, it is not justification for its illegality. I understand both sides.

Everyone does (or SHOULD do)their own part, working hard and diligently, but then when the time comes to present, the speaker of the group gets all the recognition and everyone else's hard work is quickly dismissed.

It is fair that everyone can have their own morals, beliefs and religious system, but what about the whole idea of separation of church? Just because \"the bible says so\" doesn't mean that is what our country should go by. Do you see what I mean? I have a lot more to say on this issue, though I know there is really no way of winning the argument. Is there really a happy-medium? Because I mean if abortions were to be allowed for only hazardous pregnancies, rape and incest cases, where and how excactly do you draw the line? If it's okay for some women, why not for all? And in the case of pregnancies that are harmful for the pregnant woman, perhaps it is \"God's will\" that it ends that way? I don't really believe that, I'm just throwing it out there. Anyway, I would never have an abortion myself, but I wouldn't want to take that right away from any woman who wanted to use it. Afterall, if abortion is against yours or whomever's religion, they will have to take it up with Him in the end. We're not God. That statement can be taken another way: we can't take away life...but if we can make it, why CAN'T we take it away? And just because someone doesn't support something or even think it is right, it doesn't mean they should force that opinion and ways of life upon other people. That's all for now. Peace.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "My comments about the abortion portion of the debate is this... I'm not pro-abortion, but I am pro-choice. Can I be that way? I don't feel that abortion is a legitimate way of escaping the problems of unexpected pregnancy. The woman should have thought about the consequences of potential pregnancy before she decided to have sex. I know I know, but what about the women who get raped. That solution would be solved by adoption. I have heard from some people that adoption isn't a sucessful option. What I have to say to that is where's your proof? With the process of adoption, the baby, at birth, is signed over to a family or a couple. It's not like the baby is being handed over to the state. It's the state that has the problems of foster care, or the problems people may think of when they hear of adoption as a solution. But anyways, should the government keep abortion legalized? I'm against abortion, but the to tell you the truth, the government should have no say as to what women do with their bodies. Abortion is a moral problem, not a legal problem. To say something else about abortion, especially the clinics. I wish that abortion clinics would give more information about the procedure. Abortion is not simply taking a piece of tissue out of a woman's body. Abortion is taking a life away, and no one can argue that it's not.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Hey Tom Chen, thanks for the invite!

This statement below from that article is VERY true: Popular opinion has it that students' academic success depends on the quality of their teachers and textbooks. Ask the students themselves, however, and you get a different view. Here is how they account for their academic achievement: Most students believe their ability and effort are the main reasons for school achievement. By the same token, if asked whether they would prefer to be called smart or hard-working, they will choose smart almost every time. Why? Because they believe that hard-working students risk being considered either excessively ambitious or of limited ability, both of which they would find embarrassing.

And our SIMUW group of 24 students is only a small fraction of ALL the countless number of high school/middle school students who are here for the summer living in McMahon. A lot of people are here for summer sports camps. The McMahon dorm has a fantastic view of lake washington. The dorms are set up as a \"quad\", IE four dorm rooms in one vicinity sharing one living space/microwave/refrigerator/bathroom, and the best part, a balcony. The McMahon dorms is so oppressively hot (seems like the heat is always on even in 90 degree weather). The big windows are open with no wind coming in and yet the flies and bugs outside are attracted to the light inside. The first two nights the dorm is around 90 degrees and each room has one little fan to cool us off....... As for the food, it's 1000 times better than anything we have in Skyview or nearby Salmon Creek. Each student gets $24.50 daily for food (all free).......Lots of stuff to gorge on........And some crazy SIMUW people buy dozen cartons of milks or drinks and freezes it overnight......crazy Ha one downside of the \"quad\" dorm is that eight people have to share one bathroom/one shower. So things can get interesting with shower/bathroom schedules. The whole day spent here in UW is packed with stuff to do..........From 7:50 to 8:50 breakfast/community meetings.....From 9:00 to 12:00 morning lecture/activity.....1:30 to 4:00 afternoon lecture/activity.....4:15 to 5:00 computer alloted time.....5:30 to 6:30 dinner time, and afterwards free time to do whatever we want. During the evening times we wander around the campus/dorms/travel to university avenue or university village shopping areas/movies/community solving math problems/or playing boardgames like monopoly or risk.

How are people supposed to know what the different parties are proposing unless they are given that information on the news or on the front page of the newspaper?

Now that's what I call planning ahead. You see, I remember the flag folding part of former President Nixon's funeral when I was little, and I hear that the other aspects of his funeral was rather simplistic. But then my dad busts out and says that Nixon was a Quaker. Thus, it was likely that his funeral was planned to be more simplistic and small... just the way he wanted it. I asked my dad if there was more media coverage on Reagan than there was with Nixon, and he said no, there was an equal amount. So if anyone wants to compare the extravagency between the two deaths, it was planned for Nixon's funeral to be more private and not so much exposed. So, maybe it's not because of the Watergate Scandal that Nixon's funeral wasn't as \"big\" as Reagan's. I have to say that it makes me sick that some are speaking ill of Reagan. They're so focused on their politics that they can't even respect the former president. They say things like, \"oh he was responsible for the spread of AIDS\". Don't they know that he spent 6 billion dollars for the research of AIDS? I guess not, because they don't want to research the facts. How is it that they're able to speak of him that way even in his death? Someone in my history class once said, \"Don't speak ill of the dead\" and I totally believe that. Respect is key. Even if a certain president passed away, and his policies were ones that I don't agree with, I would still have respect enough to not argue against him, or attempt to discredit him. Some of you might be thinking, \"Oh well you're a conservative so it's easy for you to say that now, since it's Reagan that died\". NO, that's not the case. It's not hard to have respect for the dead, especially ones that DID serve our country, democrat or republican, liberal or conservative.

I am glad that we are researching this topic because we need to see how the economic policy that Bush has implemented will affect us in the future. From the articles that I read though, it seems as though Bush's 10-year plan is trying to help the middle class when it will most likely benefit to the wealthy instead. Now it is hard for me to believe everything that one reporter thought, so I am going to look for more facts and see if Bush's plan is actually helping America and not just cutting taxes and putting more of a burden on the middle class.

This may sound contradictory considering that a large portion of my posts include some sort of stab at Bush, but not EVERY issue. I listen to political talk radio for entertainment, not news. Lars Larson comes on at night and talks about how Abu Ghraib is a positive reflection on the Bush presidency, then Sean Hannity comes on and rants on how lame Bush is for not politically castrating, then executing Don Rumsfeld. Am I a fan of Bush or Rumsfeld? No. Do I think Abu Ghraib is the fault of either, no. I actually commend Rumsfeld on trying to delay the release of the photos\u2014 at least the man recognized the way of harm his boys would be put directly into as a result. Atleast I get a good laugh before I fall asleep. I understand why they do what they do. Mudslinging IS entertaining, the problem is, the political extremists that get put on the air collect a FOLLOWING for their charisma and idealism. It's rare that their is a perfect candidate for anyone, so in many ways, I could liken the popularity of a man like Michael Savage to the rise of Hitler in Germany. Many Americans feel that our government is gutless to act, and a man like Savage is all about American empowerment. With such political polarity being generated from CNN to Fox News everyone in the media, imagine the cult following a political MODERATE might generate! Talk about extremism! Now the Bible. So often in history we praises the founding fathers for their briliance in drafting the Constitution. Leaving it open to interpretation, casting it in putty rather than in steel so it can mold as times change. Maybe God should deserve the same type of credit so often to the \"revolutionary thinkers\" of the late 18th century. Everyone interprites the Holy Bible differently, and that is generally accepted by everybody, but this is the first time I've really thought it might be part of the design. I guess the most important fact is that people are looking to God for an answer, and for that, I commend them. God is an invaluable resource.

But the incident that really got me thinking was the night before we at Pendleton H.S. left for a district acting compostition in Portland. We were performing our skits and monolgoues for an audience, and one was about this girl whose mother forced her to abort her child, and then ran away from her mother, who kept trying to find her and bring her home. The daughter wouldn't, since she'd killed off a living thing in her womb. It was all along those lines, and I lost all pretensions for abortion (including the for population control bit). That piece of acting was especially powerful, and it gave me a very personal look at the whole issue. It is something living to me, regardless of its cognizance of its state, for it's growing and is a nutrient-needing being, possessing of a soul.

The baby's wonderful and everything's fine, but I then my friend told me that her sister is considering getting an abortion instead of having the baby. Before hearing that, I had been fine with abortion. I don't consider it to be killing a life because it doesn't really have life yet, and I was totally pro-choice and all that. But after hearing that one of my friend's sisters is considering getting an abortion...it just made me so sad that she would do that.

I found myself reading some info sheets on economic policy last night, and I found myself very engrossed in it. It was either \"Look what Bush's economic policies are doing for us positively\" or the opposite. I found some valid facts, but also language that was deliberate, a spin to catch the public. I too often despise the political mire, and it can disgust me how politicians can continue to bicker endlessly along partisan lines till the cows come home, and there aren't any cows in D.C. Partisanship makes me mad, it was one of the reasons I was so ticked reading the stuff in the text book a month back on Richard Nixon - the old heated partisan warrior. You put this whole bickering gig in historical perspective, and I love that. Much more fighting than helping has ever been done in this country; truly, in the entire history of man. There's to much to loose for all our politicians to work together. I'm going to become slightly partisan here, it may seem, but this is what I observed when reading yesterday: that we've been getting jobs back the last three months, but we lost several million in the past three years. There were some cool things that we have coming, but a lot of crap happened too. I hate that I'm not being specific, but I've got the stuff on me, so if you'd like I could show it to you, and I was carefully looking at this info, trying to be objective. I seem to have more bias against the Bush administration than the opposite side, but I saw that in myself and tried to look in that same light on those critical of the administration. Both sides have some valid points, but for me I'm not much of a Reaganomics guy, which we're living with under President Bush. I like that I'm reasearching, and it keeps me informed. I also don't like these tax cuts. To me, a government needs its money, its surpluses. We need the programs that the government provides - they should be limited so that people can't take advantage of them, but you need to have well funded programs. Raegan cut taxes, aznd limited funfding for some of these programs. I also wonder at these stats in the course of my research, whether they were caused by Bush's policies directly, or are a part of regular economic rise and fall, or both. I hated being on the pro-George site, 'cause it was so obvious that they were trying to use stuff like patriotism to catch unwary voters for them. Both sides do it, and it disgusted me that they were trying to Big Brother me and take me for most of this country's citizens - uniformed, idiotic voters. Yet the uninformed part is more true, and I'm being judgmental to an extent. Just always be informed, go beyond the surface and see what's really going on. If you don't like George for instance, know why, and if you want something new, make sure Kerry would institute the policies that you would want; don't just vote a man in to get rid of another.

As a student I process information daily, and have found the most effective way to learn concepts is through evaluating raw facts, and analyzing relationships between themes. In politics I find this straightforward analysis nearly impossible because no source presents all of the facts on a single issue; instead, columnists selectively use facts to win imaginary arguments. As a result, I find myself repulsed by political reporting. I\u2019m torn between the desire to learn about the world around me and the intense repugnance I feel toward the political media. People make politics personal, which is unnecessary and detracts from progress. I dream of a world where opposing political parties can discuss issues and make decisions based on what\u2019s best for the nation and not what\u2019s best for their respective organizations; however, I understand this is the nature of politics; they are purely subjective. America is a half-constructed bridge, spanning the continent from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and the political parties are the construction team responsible for the next phase in building. Because the political parties are on the same team it would seem logical for them to work together to build the strongest structure possible; however, since their inception they spent more time waging wars and fighting than planning for the future. Government officials should be driven by building the best nation possible, not lining their pockets or making a name for themselves. Unfortunately, this is seldom the case and the root of my inner conflict. The role of the government is to create a healthy, sound country, and far too many politicians lose sight of this goal for me to follow avidly; however, because the fate of the nation depends on voters, I and others like me must swim through the political gobbledegook and get to the heart of the issues \u2013 I just wish I didn\u2019t have to wear waders to do it. -Ryan PS - I admire all of you who closely follow politics and respect your opinions greatly\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "One of the things that i think of first when i hear about Reagon is Iran-Contra.

They all have been famous after death and will continue to be celebrated for centuries to come and yet during their life times they were either banished and criticized for their work or drunk, poor and struggling for survival.

Because we are all still great friends, no matter what difference of opinions we have. Yeah true friendship has to be able to withstand political debates! Chris, I honor your detailed analysis of the motives/arguments/reasonings behind both polarized sides of this GM issue......Your post sounded like a mature moderator's post trying to bring together the two sides. However, I have to dissagree with you on one important fact, and that is, the Gay Marriage debate will not always go around in circles. Not everyone in the country (on both sides) is willing to sit idly and let the gay marriage issue be pushed out of debate like a gag order. Even if the issue of gay marriage will not be resolved for decades......It will eventually be ......No matter what end of political spectrum America's general populace stands, there are and WILL ALWAYS be the progressives who will change America forever. And here I have to insert my own personal opinion (WAAAAAA SCARY PERSONAL OPINION)......That I really hope the resolved will forever legalize gay marriage. And I'm convinced along with a lot of my peers that if America continues its 250 years of journey in the pursuit for the real meaning of freedom and democracy, that Gay Marriage will eventually be legalized. But this can be a long wait........Maybe many decades......But I'm convinced that eventually it will happen. Simply looking at America's past, you'll see that altho there are short term regressions to more goold old traditional fundamental values, the general path of America's history has always been taking the step to become more progressive and democratic and egalitarian (For such important issues now we take granted such as: From the first ten amendments to: ALL MEN'S SUFFRAGE, Public Education, ABOLITION OF SLAVERY, Women's right to vote, Separation of Church and State (including teaching evolution), Trust-Busting policies on monopolies, Social Securities, Healthcare/Medicare, Minimum Wage, Conservation, De-Segregation, Civil Rights, Sexual Revolution, Non-Discriminatory Clause(There the disabled gained their rights), And finally African American's Rights to Vote ). And shorterm regression of more conservative values such as prohibition on Alcohol and Jim Crow Lows just DID NOT WORK AND DID NOT LAST. Just looking at your parents and grandparents, which generation is more \"conservative\", which generation is more \"free\" or which generation strives for more freedom? (56% of 17-24 year olds suport GM as opposed to 19% 65 years and over). The more recent list that I will eventually able to add to the list of America's journey towards the true democratic values has become abortion and gay marriage.

I personally believe that all of us have our own ten/twenty or however many commandments that we hold close to our hearts and which are precisely the reflections of our views on life based on our OWN individual experiences. That's the primary reason why I call myself \"partially religious\" and of course because I believe in God in my own special way...

But nontheless I have been reading the arguments on the blog lately with interest. Both Rob and Mary both have very valid points and I'm sure if given the chance they would contradict one another into the next millenium. But the fact is and I quote Rob,\"one thing I have learned through the GM debate is that you won't be able to convince anyone to drastically alter their position, based on religion or otherwise.\" So these arguments stewed up by the bright minds of our Ap US history class are hopeless, in the end it all comes down to what you believe in as an individual. For example: Mary holds strongly to her faith, a virtue of which every question derived from the bible comes down to for answer, and uses this belief to battle and contradict Rob's arguments, while Rob uses modern situations as proof to regard or disregard arguments like Marys that are based upon faith. Both of these strong willed individuals represent 2 of the many separate groups in the battle for gay marriage, each group possessing a strong and opinionated following. The only problem with this situation is that neither group appears to be morally wrong in their thinking, and therefore there is not an easy way to chose sides. Due to this the battle for gay marriage will go around in circles in vain attempts of each side of the argument to gain a majority on the matter. But with each argument presented by each of the opposite viewed sides there will be arguments to address the stated argument and arguments to address the stated arguments argument, and with each contradiction those groups will move further apart from eachother as characteristic human stubborness is triggered with the attack on ones argument. With this reasoning in mind, I don't think that gay marriage will be legalized throughout the United States for quite some time. No one can expect a drastic idea such a same sex marriage to be accepted by a society of people who have been morally against the idea of homosexuality their entire lives.

It's not that I'll give up backing it till it's legal, so feel free to talk to me in person, but I've decided it's alright for the blog to go another direction. So here it is. Mary, I appreciate your love for me, and I hope you know it's entirely reciprocal, but I also hope you know that the Bible means no more to you than it does to me. I hope I've made it clear that I'm familiar with what the Bible has to say, and CLEARLY we have different interpretations (I guesss neither of us can call either interpretation WRONG), but I can confidently say right now that every human in the world has a bias. It's human nature to have some sort of preconceived notion, some unfaltering instinct that affects how we see the world. Part of our bias comes from the society we live in. We have our cultural norms, our milieus or what have you that would make aspects of the culture in our neighbors of Mexico and Canada confusing at times. Mexicans have a very different view of personal space, not afraid to come sit right down next to you on an empty bus. As the egotistical douche yet talented film-maker Michael Moore demonstrated in Bowling For Columbine, Canadians don't feel the need to lock their doors at night. A scenario many not feel comfortable with in their homes in the states. My point is that when it says in Romans that men turned to other men in unnatural lust, in Roman society homosexuality was not considered normal, especially not natural. I myself get uncomfortable seeing men kissing (...\"I am beautiful, no matter what they say...\"), but I don't see it as immoral. When there is a natural inclination to repel homosexuality combined with a society even less friendly to gays, bias plays a factor in Paul's writing. Do you see where I'm coming from? I'm not trying to discredit any of the apostles, but I do want to remind the world that they can't be expected to be any more than human. (For the record, I'm referencing the New Testament exclusively because Mary referred to herself as a judeo-christian. If you want my argument against the Old Testament, jump back a couple weeks worth of posts) Moving on to data. Even if Rush does cite his sources, they could be the product of any number of think tanks funded by any number of VERY biased corporations. Tobacco did all kinds of studies saying how bad tobacco WASN'T for you. I think NPR would be one of the most direct sources of info out there. If you don't want to believe Sean Hannity, I don't really either, but you can trust a credible source like an NPR newsbreak. Lastly because I'm a left-winged secularist who only gets A's because I wright what teachers want to hear politcally, let me back up one more statement with imperical data; going after your spelling was a good natured ribbing, but you were 1/9 in spelling marriage correctly. (Take that whole last paragraph in a sarcastic tone, but the data I believe to be correct. Do you want me to reference my source?) My last statement will address you not agreeing with homosexuality. Why not? You know my arguments, and I guess you can say because that's your morality, but there IS a basis for morality. I just want to know what yours is. By the way, I LOVE Mary Tyner as a human being. The great thing about this country is that we're all allowed to have our beliefs and opinions, share them with each other, and be homies at the end of the day.

I find it amazing, though, how you can quote this, and quote that, but yet you don't know what verses mean. Again, people taking such an objective view when they regard the bible. You don't know how to interpret. Or is it that I interpret it differently? Obviously, there is a difference between us in what we regard as the truth. (By the way, Rush always tells his audience what his sources are, or if what he's saying is his opinion.) When it comes to the bible/religious stuff, there's a difference between having faith in a religion, or just believing in it. For me, it's faith. It's not that I take every single word in the bible and take it literally. That's not the intent. Just a note... Jesus, in his teachings, spoke metaphorically, or through examples and stories so he could teach his disciples. Thus, not everything is to be taken literally. These disciples, who you call bias, are the ones who have the first hand account and have written these accounts in their books Mark, Luke, John and so on. If you have faith, you don't think of these men as biased figures who totally disregard the views of others. I'm not saying don't ever question these men and do everything they say, they are the new gods now... ahhhh! What I'm saying is that these men, these disciples, in regards to christianity, are telling what they know, are telling what Jesus taught them. What I'm saying in all of this mumbo jumbo is to be careful when you use the bible for reference, everyone, because when you use the bible, you're entering the territory of religion, and you're right rob this is a history class, not a theology class. If you really want to know my direct opinion on Gay Marriage, I'm against it. But the question is, to what extent? I don't even know the answer to that question, because I'm not against gay people. But I am against the lifestyle. I'll go along like it's normal, which is called tolerance, but inside my head I'll be thinking it's wrong and there's no way you can change that, the same way I can't change you. But I dare you to try. Back to data, it's not like I don't use it. I QUESTION every blatant piece of data to ASSESS THE VALIDITY OF THE STATEMENT (haha, never thought I'd hear that outside the AP exam). I question not only the liberals, but also conservatives. I question my side as well because I want to make sure that I know what it is I'm believing in/ have faith in. Always ask questions. And make them simple questions too. That way, if you don't get a straight forward, simple answer, then you know that that person who is answering the question is BS'ing with you. So no, Robby Bobby, I don't just go with my gut feeling alone. I know the facts first, I repeat THE FACTS first, and then I perhaps use my gut/mind/brain/head, whatever you want to call it, that makes me decide what it is I say, do, think and stuff. Thanks for the response. I love you Rob.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Mary, I admire your commitment to your statements. It's easy to hide behind rhetoric and avoid conflict, but by standing by what you say and inviting opposition you show tremendous security. I would first like to address your alarmingly confrontational attitude towards numbers and statistics. You are correct that data collections can be interpreted many different ways, and are often presented strategically to convey a certain point of view, but by no means is that always the case. With my personal experience I find the majority number twisters to be those on political talk shows, including your beloved Rush Limbaugh. Al Franken does the same thing, and I'm not trying to say it's strictly a conservative thing, but try and argue with the fact that states at the time of this post, approximately 117 billions of American dollars have been spent on the war in Iraq. Or that since the invasion, 828 Americans have lost their lives in combat. Tell me that statistic can be twisted to comfort the mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and children of those lost in Iraq. If you don't base decisions, viewpoints, etc. on \"imperical data,\" what exactly DO you base them on? Gut feeling? Gut feeling gets you the Salem Witch trials. A clever little process known as the Scientific Method led the world out of The Dark Ages and into the Renaissance and is responsible for the development and institution of MODERN MEDICINE. If I had cancer, gut instinct wouldn't lead me to subject myself to chemotherapy or radiation treatment\u2014 both cell-anhialating and physically exhausting therapies, but the imperical data that shows that survival rate is MUCH higher with those treatments would probably sway my thinking. Moving on to your GM argument, I'm still unclear. Do you believe that GM should be legal? Clearly you have stated you do not support it based on the Bible, that is, the New Testament, but based on the current law, do you believe that amending the Constitution to ban GM is legal? One thing I have learned through the GM debate is that I won't be able to convince anyone to drastically alter their position, based on religion or otherwise. I have tried and tried, typed countless words, referencing countless verses, and yet I have done little to directly express what I keep alluding to: The Bible, New Testament or Old, is not an infallible source. The most direct reference to homosexuality in the New Testament comes from Romans, which loosely states that men turned to men and committed unnatural acts out of lust. It does not say that homosexuality is wrong, just \"unnatural.\" With that out of the way let me remind everyone that the New Testament is not document written by the hand of God, or even translated from God's divine mouth as some of the Old Testament was. The New Testament is a collection of first-hand accounts with Jesus from various people; the Romans, Mark, Jude, etc. The point is, the reader of the Gospel must remember that this collection of accounts is at all times subject to the author's bias, and even the deviation from the original meaning through years of translation. For all anyone knows, \"unnatural\" as it was written might have been more accurately translated as \"unconventional.\" The Bible, New Testament and Old, contains excellent themes on how to live ones life as well as the most redeeming sacrifice of the Son of God for eternal souls of all us sinners, but it is not a document that can be taken word for word as the unvarying decree of the Most High. I disagree with you that God or His son would object to the marriage of two homosexuals who followed the teachings of Jesus on marriage; where their flesh becomes one, they are devoted to each other, and that they love each other as they love themselves. Does He find THAT unholy? Lastly, the Old Testament has some ridiculous inapplicable laws, as I demonstrated in previous posts. However, the New Testament is not clean of some socially questionable direction as well. The book of Ephesians says \"the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior\". Does this condemn all Christian wives to a life of servitude? Certainly, with the influence of the Feminine Mystique (this IS a history blog after all), huge amounts of women have become significant breadwinners in the household, is this What Jesus Would have them Do? I hope I have presented my ideas clearly. For future reference, marriage is spelled as so, not marrAIge. God Bless and good night. Love Rob\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "You are certainly welcome Natalya. I'm glad you read what I had to say. For me, I never trust numbers unless I know the source in which those numbers come from. Who was surveyed? What questions were asked in regards to the survey? There are a lot of ways numbers can be manipulated, which, as a result, can sway the data in a way that supports an idea. I rarely rely on percentages, ratios and what-not unless I know how the data was brought up. For example, I saw on the back of a bus in Portland the other day that read on the rear \"249 cars are at home because I am on the road\". How do I know they didn't make up the number? Most people who ride the bus don't even own a car! So, by counting the number of people who ride the bus everyday for reliance on the accurancy of that particular data isn't gonna cut it. That is the type of BS statistic that makes me question every form of data I hear, unless I know what the source is. So NPR is going to need to present their resources for their data before I trust what they say. I have to ask Nat, how is it that you are somewhat religious, but don't even know if religious is real? Interesting. In regards to the bible, those who believe in the judeo-christian religion go by the New Testament, the place where Jesus's teachings are, which is the place where the religion originated. The New Testament is the place where Jesus speaks of homosexuality. And don't call people hypocrites because they don't fast or don't follow the Ten commandments strictly. That is part of the Old Testament. And it seems to me that you think that fasting and ten commandments stuff is all you think the Christian religion is. It seems to me that you're taking the standpoint of christianity very objectively, in which you think that we point fingers at the gay marriage issue and say \"you're sinning! you're sinning!\". We all know people sin. People who \"go by the bible\" sin. The Pope has sinned! What I'm saying is, is that as a christian, in regards to the Gay Marriage issue, we're not pointing fingers as to who's a sinner for being gay. It's the fact that those who support gay marraige are trying to take the sacred, holy idea of marraige and turn it into an unholy union.

DOn't believe that stereotype,\" when you yourself blatantly state: \" Students who are viewed to be the smart ones are viewed that way... because they're left-winged/secularists who use data up the ying-yang to prove their point.\" Isn't that a major stereotype you just have created yourself? It seems as if you call all the \"smart\" people boot-lickers who side with the side that their liberal teachers take, that we are not guided by morals in our arguments but only by \"data\" and scientific experiments. I personally have very strong morals I comply with and I am somewhat religious (if there is such a thing) but I always prove my every argument with \"imperical data\" just because that's the info that can not be made up and can not be proven wrong or considered opinionated; numbers do not swing either liberal or conservative, they are neutral. What you say about writing papers that teachers like I also consider to be very argumentative, and it of course depends on the school you go to, but the majority of teachers I am sure would prefer you to write a paper that is original in idea and content and shows you to be open-minded thinker. About abortion, it's great that you have that kind of sense of responsibility for your actions, and I think it's partly because you know that that won't ever happen to you, but we have to remember about all the people that simply do not have that kind of education/surrounding atmosphere/family to support them when they are faced with that kind of choice of either having a child and giving up their future or seeing a doctor for a couple hours and killing that precious spark of life. I still don't know what I would exactly do myself, but I would probably side with you. However I am very strongly for abortion for those who NEED it, or who believe they do. GM: I don't know how you can tell a gay person that he/she wasn't even \"intended\" to be alive on this earth, just because it says in the Bible that God did not include gays in his original design.

I want to reference slavery in what Jefferson wrote about the exclusion of Black people from the constitutional definition of \"men\" just based on the reasoning that Afr. Amer. are \"a different species,\" thus degrading \"a whole race of men from the rank in the scale of being which THEIR(?)

I was thinking a little bit about how representative the ASB is of the students\u2014 and it's basically trust on behalf of the student body that gives the governing body \"artistic license\" to run the school as it sees fit. There are no referendums, and although meetings are open to the entire student body to sit in on, nobody ever does, or probably even knows it's an option. In an effort to make my presidency more directly representative as well as continue my theme of the importance of democratic participation, I would like to have the school vote on how I should vote in the elections held this November. It would be one vote representing the entire school, and it would sacrifice my own voice, but I think mock campaigning in school for candidates at all government levels would expand the knowledge and interest in politcs of the school; a heritage that would be far more valuable than the vote I would cast on my own. With a fervor that hinges on administrative support, I would like to pursue this concept. What does everyone think? I want comments from both students and their parents on this one. But not Mike Rush, he is an ignorant Pig-Dog who deserves no respect from anyone. (Mike demanded I begin trash talking on the blog). Secondly, I want to organize a large-scale trivial pursuit contest- who would be down to participate? Trivial Pursuit will be the next big thing in this school and nobody wants to miss out on this. May democracy live long and prosper. Love Rob P.S. Create Blogger profiles.

Mary, I'm not sure I get your stance on gay marriage. You say you're morally against abortion but you think it should be legal. Do you have the same position on GM? I found the arguments you made a little contradictory. First I want to say that I understand you respect everyone's right to an opinion, that is what you intended isn't it? But for someone who doesn't want to come off as a right-wing bigot, you kind a come off as a right wing bigot when you challenge \"left-wing secularists\" who don't reference their morals for forming logical platforms based on fact. I understand there is a fine line to walk between faith and fact, but I don't think a person has to choose one or the other. The \"smarter people\" you refer to have a right to desire evidence to support the belief that God didn't intend homosexual's to marry. If that evidence comes from the Bible, that is fine, but I guess what I'd like is some flexibility in one's \"morals.\" I, Left-wing Secularist, read your post and find myself questioning some of your statements you credit to your morality. I, Left-wing Secularist, would like to know WHY you feel how you feel, where your morals come from, because I feel that I have evidence and \"imperical data\" to contest the morals you base your argument on. And I, Left-wing Secularist, feel that I have analiable justification to disregard baseless morals if they don't coincide with mine. With that said, can you satisfy my curiosity as to why you believe homosexuality is immoral? I have my own theories, some of which I have expressed, but in the interest of originality, I'll only provide them upon your request. Long story short, my biggest problem with the argument that homosexuality is immoral (whether right or wrong) is that it means homosexuality is WRONG and homosexuals are WRONG, spawning an attitude that is anti-homosexual which punishes those who had homosexuality thrust upon them whether by biology or development (there are studies that make strong cases for both). Is that fair? You say God didn't intend homosexuals to marry, then why were the created? To be deliberately persecuted by faithful Christians? Did God intend addiction, physical disability or car accidents? I don't think that they were spontaneous developments while His holiness stood idly by. I don't want to question your ideology, maybe just some minor parts, but it's only because I have imperical data from the holiest of books to back me up. Post on the blog, e-mail me, or talk to me about it because I think it's an important discussion, but know that like Jesus, I'll always love you. That goes for everyone Love, Rob P.S.

The amount of damage humans have done, do, and will continue to do to the earth always amazes me. It seems that humans are extremely selfish. If humans continue to plague the earth with pollutants at this rate, it will inevitably lead to destruction of the Earth or the human race, whether it be from depletion of ozone or the melting of the icecaps. It sickens me that although we know this information we continue to pollute and plague the earth. I also saw the movie Day After Tomorrow and was somewhat dissapointed but it was still an okay movie. I have never really liked Dennis Quaid (I think that is how you spell it), I think he wasn't good for the part. Anyway it's worth the 7.50 to see it. Mr. Parlee is a good teacher. He is very opinionated but, as Ryan and I were talking, we found it somewhat refreshing to hear actual political opinions by someone as educated in history and politics as he is. Usually teachers are hesitant about revealing their opinions because they don't want to offend anyone, but because Mr. Parlee is a substitute he is able to cross those boundries. Lastly, does anyone know where Clark went? She told us but I forgot.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Rob, thank you for bringing up a different topic! It was getting really repetitive in here! I think that global warming is a really important topic that doesn't get enough credit. Again, thanks to \"the man\" for leaving it alone and letting people forget that it does exist and could cause major problems in the future. One of the issues is that scientists aren't getting funds to research plausible effects of the increase in carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere, which has definitely increased over the last twenty years or so. Just for everyone's knowledge, the movie \"The Day After Tomorrow\" is pretty much bogus, in terms of the causes of global warming. The idea that the actual warming of the world would be immediately followed by a global ice age is pretty unrealistic. But as long as it reminds people of global warming and the problems that it could eventually create, then I'm all for it!But, anyways, not enough of \"the governments\" money goes into research for global warming and, while the process is irreversible, it would be worthwhile to research how we could slow down the process that we're now heavily involved in. However, although the issue seems like it would be pretty un-controversial, there are many scientists who actually believe that global warming is not something that humans cause, that it is simply part of the world turning and getting older. In the last century on the earth's surface (keep in mind that this is on the ground, not in the actual atmosphere), there have been increases of at three degrees Fahrenheit, which may not sound like much, but it's caused the sea level to rise from six inches to about three feet. Of course the increase in sea level is caused by ice sheets melting from the increase in temperature. It's all relevant!!! And, if these changes had taken place over the last thousand years, it really wouldn't be that big of a deal. Wow, the earth changes....what a concept! But the fact that over only 100 years so many changes have taken place...well, it's worth getting into. You guys, please respond to this one. It's important, and we need to move on from the gay marriage and abortion topics. I think that everyone has said what needs to be said, and it's time for something else. Later!

Hope everyone is doing well. ~Joseph\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Today I started to remember a couple of books I read a while back which I would love to read again. I generally do not read books more than once, particularly if these books have had a positive impact on my life and also if I liked them a lot. For me the decision to rate a book, movie or CD as good or bad, largely depeds on my mood at the time that I read it, saw it or heard it. It is amazing that I am still able to listen to albums that I have owned for years and somehow fall in love with a totally obscure song within it. Movies are the same, and books as well. Nevertheless, there are books, albums and movies that for me, stand the test of time. If such items are able to transcend my moods, then these become favourites and are rated highly. An example of an album would be 'Crash' by Dave Matthews Band. An album that is musically and lyrically awesome. An example of a movie would be the entire \"Lord of The Rings\" trilogy. I must say that those movies have spoiled me greatly! An example of a book would be \"The Little Prince\" - a book that always hits home. Just recently I read \"Veronika decides to die\" by Paulo Coelho for the 2nd or 3rd time. I still find this book very good and enjoyable. And today, I was trying to remember the author of this book I borrowed from a friend a couple of years ago - it was titled \"Beauty\". Eventually i found it listed on Amazon. Its author is Sheri S Tepper. At the time that I read this book I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommended it to a few friends. I wonder if I still feel the same way... Similarly, when I make my journey back to the country of my birth in around 3 months I wonder what every thing will be like to me. Now I have almost 17 years of living a life in a new country that I love and revere - what will I think? I am sure that everything will seem so small and crowded in comparison to my new home but will I hate it? Will I fall in love again? There are so many things I struggle to remember and some that are deeply and lucidly embedded in my heart and my mind. How will I cope? What will I do? I cannot even begin to guess...\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "It seems like only yesterday that the Olympic Games were being held in Sydney. I can't believe that 4 years have already passed and Thorpe and co are at it again. This time 4 years ago I was about to finish my contract with The Olympic Store. That was a really good experience on so many levels - but primarily the ability to take part in such an event beyond the role of a mere spectator. I remember meeting quite a few athletes, who could always be spotted very quickly, and having very nice experiences as a result. I remember that all the athletes I met had the most healthy appearance - usually tanned and toned and focused. Now, I have a 'serious' job where I no longer get to rub shoulders with athletes but this is not exactly a bad thing. Some days, I feel as if I have life experience beyond my years but there are other days when a little trigger reminds me that I have so much to learn and discover...

Must say that I am not as attuned to ghostly presences as my sister is, but I have had my share of weird experiences. One that comes to mind is a shared experience actually. My sister and I saw the same ghost at the same time. No idea who he was but he did follow us when we moved homes. Last time I saw him was a couple of years ago. I really am looking forward to this ghost tour though - it will be mostly indoors using candlelight to make our way around the old Georgian mansion. Good thing there will be a dozen of us on the tour! Sometimes I do wonder what I would do if faced with a nasty ghost. The one I encountered with my sister was very harmless... Are there such things as ghosts, why do they hang around? I wonder if we get the choise to become a ghost when we die - would be interesting to be one.

I would like to apologize for the last post. Normally I am not that pathetically metaphorical but when nothing happens in my life, I start to think about life and what it means.

And while some people may just ask for this star if they were given the opportunity to have anything they wanted, I think a lot of people would only take something that would put them in line with this star. Obtaining that star isn't the goal of life, its just the end mark, the finish line at the end of a triathalon, the moment of satisfaction when you can look back and say \"I did it.\" I think most people would actually rather enjoy that long hard road to that far away twinkle of light. that's the idea that our 8 year olds wish to belive life is. Much of society today lose that 8 year old mentality as soon as they hit double digits, realizing that life just isn't that simple.Those many meteors which tend to hit you in a new direction guide you to a new star.

Once in a blue moon, someone will realize that meteors may be avoided, and that twinkle of a star can still reflect in your 8 year old eyes despite how close you are to triple digits. One in a blue moon, someone gets to that star they always wanted and it means so much to them to be able to look back on the wonderful meteors that they've encountered, overcome, and even dodged; and that twinkle in their eye is now a reflection on the star they started off from so far away. I am not ashamed to admit I have a very big twinkle in my eye.This twinkleis not a reflection however it is the spark of the unknown. My destination isnothing more than an empty spaceand you may choose whether it is fortunate or unfortunate that it is probably the furthest of all. ForI wish to not only make it to the stars, but to become one. I say that one day I will make it big, everyone will know me, and I will be me, not the next Julia Robberts, Susan Sarandon, or Meryll Streep. I say this half because I am in denial, half because the world is in denial. There is no other choice than for me to achieve that dream and I hope that I will not let my meteors push me away from the twinkle my 5 year old eye had not so long ago. Seriously, who really wants to be pushed around by big dumb rocks? That having been said, if I were given the opportunity to have anything I wanted, whether possible or impossible, I think I would be3 years older than I am today while still keeping my heart locked up in the 5 year old mentality that gives my eyes the twinkle of the future. As corny as all of this sounds, I believe it. As much as this resembles a valedictorian speech gone awry, its true. Its a shame that today most peopledon't push their limit. And when I fall asleep at night, I am proud of my deepest impossible desire. I don't think I'm settling for less, and I don't think I'm taking away any of the long journey I have to obtain my star. Bon soir.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Wow, how pathetic? Me, jumping on the bandwagon once again.Somehow this seems familiar however, you know, one of those deja vu moments. That could be due to the fact that this is now the third website that I have registered myself in so that I can \"share my with the world via this beautiful cable modem\". I have unsuccessfully attempted these darn things at deadjournal.com and livejournal.com, kind ofironic that those were the two that I chose but I guess you could say I was going through those teenage years where one never really knows how they feel. One day you hate yourself, the next you think you're the bomb. Anyway both of those wonderful glimpses of my past were put to rest due to some stupidity that I published and got caught for, the 'rents don't really approve of sharing your life with complete strangers. I get it though, I don't even know if I'm really all that comfortable with some complete stranger guy reading this and trying toimagine me sitting here and describing my life. With my luck it would be some old fat man who's been outside in the sun too many hours of his life, smoked too many cigarettes, and probably hasn't showered in days. Hey, everyone attracts a type right? Ha. Anyway, I think I'm going to keep this wonderful glimpse of my life on the dl for a little while, not really register as anyone so that my friends who have all created their own (and about 10 of them have in the past month or so) won't be able to find me and accuse me of being somewhat hypocritical. I think I have a tendency to do that at times. So in order to protect my own identity and the identities of those I love and care oh so much about, and so that I don't bore you, the reader, to death, I will follow 2 rules when writing these hopefully enjoyable blogs: 1. I will not refer to anyone in their real name. I don't even know if I'll use the same name for the same person in multiple blogs, its more fun that way. 2. I will not provide you with the boring details of every moment I get supper giddy from being in love with some stupid boy.Basically, no one wants to hear about my love for someone when nothings going to happen and, if it is possible, even fewer people want to know about some beautiful relationship where all I say is \"oh I love insert name of love here \". Gag me, please. So there are my rules: simple, easy, and logical. And now that I have established this blog withall of the necessities, I will make my way into slumberland having left this one question for all to ponder: If you could have one thing in the world, anything you want (physically possible or impossible) what would you ask for? If you were to attain it, would you be happy or want something more? Goodnight.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Life as been pretty straight foward. Wake up; do the chores; sitck to the routine; go to work; come home and go to sleep. I've been liking everything I've been doing so the normal isn't a bother to me but a little change is more than welcome. Tonight was definately a little different. Getting to know someone is like getting into a pool that could be ice cold. Tonight I stuck my big toe into the water and found out its pretty luke warm, I think. A very smart person (who just so happens to be very talented with an ice cream pricing machine) told me that instead of sticking my foot in next I should just go in to the knee. I wonder what that means. HA, I'm sure I'll figure it out. I just hope its all figured out by the time I leave (12 days and counting). If not, then I guess it will have to be figured out during \"weekend trips\". Whats really interesting is how people go about getting to know one another. Its no longer \"Do you want to come play at my house? I have the new lego set!\", or \"Do you want to sleep over?\". These days strong emotions get intertwined into these words, they mean so much more than the actual meaning. It was nice for \"Do you want to join me for ice cream?\" actually mean that. I hope it stays that way and I hope life continues in this basic routine, with a surprise thrown in there every once in a while. Maybe I'll step into the water a little further with each surprise down the way. The sparks of new and exciting stuff are so much brighter if you seize them for everything they are. Meanwhile this routine is done. Its time for bed so that I can wake up, drive, do the chores, go to work. Buona Notte.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "In three weeks time I will be sleeping in my dorm room bed after a LONG day of driving and unpacking. The next big chapter of my life will be starting and it will finally be setting in that I am no longer a child. Tonight's entry is going to be filled with a couple of allusions to my shift at Pazzo Cucina tonight. For instance, \"Tiempo y Silencio\" is the name that a waiter, Matt, at the restaurant will give his next horse. For those, like myself, who need to seek out their Spanish speaking friends to decipher this not-so-foreign language, it means \"Time and Silence\". Its actually quite a beautiful name for a horse and arouses some interesting thoughts about life. Another memory of this evening that I keep returning to is one of Angelo, the owner. We were discussing how I was having a hard time believing how short three weeks really are. (I don't know about you, but my past three weeks have gone by faster than it takes to count the days, maybe because its been so quiet.) In response to my amazement about how quickly sand falls through the hourglass, Angelo tells me that before I realize it I will be his age (a ripe old 33) and I will probably be pregnant (\"out to here\" he says, making the appropriate gesture about a foot away from his stomach) with a wonderful family to boast. I know he speaks the truth. I know that when that day comes, I will remember his prediction, and I know that those 16 years will feel like a day. My only hope is that when I sit back and really think about all that time, I don't remember silence. Silence, while experiencing it, lasts forever. One minute of silence can feel like an eternity. But when remembering that minute at some later day, it holds as much value as a nanosecond. When I am 33 with a belly \"out to here\", I hope that I can look back on 16 years of adventure, happiness, accomplishment, maybe even a little failure (who learns anything without a little bit of mishaps?). I want to remember everyone who has touched my life, all the places I will have touched, and be ready for many more 16 years. Because really, who wants to remember life when they are old and about to die? Then you just get depressed about all the things you planned to do, and don't get the opportunity to actually accomplish them. Its funny how time works. Just when you have it figured out (which obviously, I don't), you've miraculously ran out of it. Maybe its my nostalgia for everyone I've missed out on this summer. Maybe its my nostalgia for everyone I've missed out on all my life. Its not like I've purposefully missed out, it's actually exactly as Tyler put so perfectly: \"It's not that my desire is false, but rather that my intention is optimistic at best and ultimately vapid\", and that's rather sad. Things may pick up in the next few weeks as everyone realizes how close we are to saying goodbye. I sure as hell am going to miss all of them (even my very close family at Pazzo) but I don't want that loneliness to remind me of silence. Even more, I don't want my life to resemble my memories of this summer. Per adesso, Buonanotte. Para ahora, Buenas noches. For now, Goodnight.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I will be 18 years of age. I will be able to die for my country in battle, buy a piece of property, even decide who will lead our country for the next four years. That last privilege is one that will impact many, many lives, more so then usual, and if all us \"young people\" do not participate in this very important act, things could go horribly wrong. Tonight I was schooled on this, and I was forced to grow up a little bit. In order to vote properly, you have to have a set of ideals, know whether any of the candidates share in these ideals, and be willing to compromise on their ideals you do not share. I was never one to follow politics, its so messy. Candidates are too concerned with getting votes than just showing who they are and what they will do. Its about getting elected, not leading the country. I knew that this was something I'd eventually have to get into because I hate the thought of being a stupid \"young person\" who doesn't care less about where the country is headed. I just didn't expect it to come so soon. So I joined my new roomie and her friends at Fridays tonight for some late night munchies. We began discussing Kerry and Bush (there were 2 VERY SUPPORTIVE Kerry-ins) and everyone else didn't have much to say. I decided to play Devils Advocate just to see where it would go. From the Presidential Election we moved to Gay marriages and progressed to Religion. We were a bunch of late teens discussing the major debates of society. It felt good. But as good as it felt at the time, I look back on it now and realize that I like to discuss topics, not get in heated debates about them. We almost got to that point tonight. And with my firm beliefs about my religion and the good man upstairs, sometimes people get defensive when discussing these fragile concepts. Case and point: Do not get into a discussion about the differences between the Roman Catholic Church and the Episcopal (Anglican) Church with a Catholic and an Anglican... It may get ugly. But the point I'm trying to make is that if everyone could put their thoughts aside for a moment and realize that sometimes there's another way of looking at things, maybe things would be a little bit easier. Maybe this scramble for presidency wouldn't be a competition for votes, but a a competition for values. Things get interesting between two people when they can listen to each others differences without taking it as a personal offense. Maybe I'm just too naive to realize the harsh realities of life. Maybe I just need to take off these glasses... Maybe I have a point. Sleep tight.

I guess it's my fault cuz i told her to bring watever she could. Hmmm now i feel really guilty bout it. So sry .... Anyway she was also gettin worried tt i got the wrong meetin place.

Dun wanna tok bout the parade since most ppl would have seen it on tv already. So let fast forward to the fireworks !!! Yeah i lov the fireworks. But since we were in the last row, the marshals gave us umbrallas to sheild us from the fallin fireworks. 4 of us had to squeese into a small pathetic umbrella so niao gu.

Sry if i am emotional or blank out this past week. Anyway i wanted to use the afternoon to do my labreport but some things cropped up and i ended up helping some1 else do their labreport. I'm not really blaming tt person or wat, in fact i wanted to thx the person for just tokin to mi .... I wasn;t really in the mood to do any work anyway considering the things i had to do later in the afternoon. Went out at bout 3.45 to meet some1. Had to do something horrible to some1.

Went to meet edmund, doreamon and kel later.I was 15 mins late. Then as if heaven was playin a bad joke on us, we had to wait for 35mins for the stupid bus. The bus reached the area around the concorde hotel and then there was a severe traffic jam arounf the area. We waited for 15mins and the bus mearly moved a few inch. I got fed-up waiting and i went downstair with my frens. I guess Mr paul tan my former com skills leturer was rite singaporeans are idiots. The blind follow the blind and before long all the ppl seated at the top deck came down to complain to the bus driver. Aparrently most of the ppl in the bus were like us, chasing against time to get to watch the fireworks. The bus driver gave in and then he opended the door to let us out. There were like 10 buses behind us and then every1 started alighting.... I guess singaporeans are idiots. Recieved a call from my fren already there sayin the fireworks gonna start in 5 mins time. We ran and ran desperatly trying to get there in time. Every1 around us were oso running. We reached the overhead-bridge near suntec when we heard the first rounds of the fireworks going off. It was kinda of nice sight watchin fireworks from a overhead bridge. After the first rounds went off, we ran again like madmen. A few other rounds of fireworks went off, WE paused to look at the fireworks everytime we heard the sound. Lucky we reached there in time for the last round of fireworks. Captured a image of the last round with the esplande in the foreground and the fireworks in the background on kel's digi cam. The pic was really nice. I gonna upload it into my blog one of these dayz when i'm more free. Then we just stood in front of the esplande while the whole crowd started to disperse. We went to marina square intending to grap a meal but it seems a lot of ppl had the same intentions. So we left marina for raffles link, again it was so crownded tt we could hadly manuvear in the crowd. Decided to walk to bugis then. We walked as we tok bout life generally. Then lulu recieve a call from jian hui's gf telling us tt jian hui who was oso watching the fireworks had fainted. All of us were laughing like hell since jian hui was well known for being physically fit. Then lulu start acting how jian hui would look like if he fainted.

Ash said it was probebly the skin of the chilli however i was not so sure so i threw away the packet of chilli and avoid eating the fries tt were in contact with the chilli. Waited a freaking 20 mins for the show to start. Had thought the show was gonna be real scary. But as thing turned out it was kinda more funny than scary. I really love the show, it was simply great. Must have been the best show i seen this few months so far. The plot was great, the show had it's funny moments n of course the scary parts too. Dunno wanna spolt the show for u guyz by telling u bout it. Anyway there was this scary scene where i was practically hiding my face behind my bag. Wasn't really tt scary but i'm really scared. Well i have to admit i'm timid. I stongly recommand every1 to watch the show. It was really great, though some ppl may find the ending a little too ....... Anyway it's just night shala(dunno wat) style. I really loved all his movies, especially the endings. Went to play LAN after tt, was just taggin along as i don;t really like playin LAN. Went to play pool after playing LAN. It's propebly like the fifth time i'm playin pool this week liao lor. Really sian liao but since all my frens are going i dun wanna be a spoilt-spot. We played 9 ball pool n omg i rulez man. I was not really in the mood to play so i was just hitting the ball for fun. All of the ppl i played with are really pros but somehow i keep winning n winning. I was bloody lucky, i can't believe my luck even until now. Generally had a real fun day but my stupid brother had to spolit things. He spilt water over my Labtop n my labtop is now spolit. I was so fucking angry with him. I can't do a shit with my computer rite now. I'm only left with a crappy useless ancient computer tt is so bloody laggy to use for the rest of the week. How the hell am i suppose to do my lab report n semester project on such a fucked up com. ASHLEY quickly finish upgrading tt other computer so i do not hav to use this craapy com or my labtop any more. I really pissed with my bro rite now, using my labtop to surf the net without my permission and then spoliting it. Wat right does he have to use my computer. I Paid for the com using my own money from my bank account. He did not even pay a single cent,not to mention the fact tt i have to pay for my monthly internet bills myself.

Went to bus stop, again exact same thing happened as yesterday. The bus had to run away the moment i ran to the bus stop. Again i did not chase the bus cuz i planned to be late anyway. So i waited for the next bus to arrive. Went i boarded the bus, i heard some1 called out my name. So i looked around n saw kelvin(from my class not K.L or K.G). I went n sat next to him, apparently he was trying to be late too. For two consequtive dayz, i wanted to be late, missed a bus, boarded the next bus n some1 from my class is on it. Maybe it a divine sign telling mi i should be late more. We chatted on the bus n then he came to the topic i feared. BOWLING SCORE FROM YESTERDAY. Reached sch, found out tt every1 all did not went for MR SOH's e-learning. Had another session of crapping e-learning for com n it. Then we has lunch at south canteen, saw ya-ling and the gals. They were buying bubble tea, then i was joking bout wee kiat to Hui-ni. Anyway for the ppl who dunno, wee kiat iz the Ex of hui-ni n i just happens to noe him n we hav the same name. Then went to have lunch, n guess who i saw, Wee kiat n he was lining up at the same bubble tea shop. Went up to him n chatted for a while. Asked if he saw hui-ni, he said no. Well i guessed as much cuz he was flirting with a pretty gal next to him (as usual). Ate lunch n went to Com n it leture. Sean n siyan slept while wee leong weian n i chatted bout anything n everything. Time flew so fast n be4 we knew it , i was Mr Soh leture.For once I understood everything he said(well now i believe in miracles) . But tt stupid fadhil had to spolt things the very first time i really understood mr soh. Fadhil started reminding every1 i was suppose to strip today cuz of the stupid bet we made yesterday. He was irritating mi until i did not catch anything from mr soh. Anyway for any CEP students who are reading this, a good advice for u. If u dun understan wat mr soh teaching nvm just go read the yellow bible (u noe the book u brought) . Helps a lot. CEP lesson ended n it time 4 hell. The guyz wanna strip mi in the leture room. Luckly most ppl left liao except our class ppl n mr soh only. I had no choice, i was the one who agreed. Well i hid behind a pillar n ...................................................................... Luckly the gals who saw were angela n carol from b2 . Otherwise i dunno how to face the world. End of sch n we went to play table tennis n badminton. Badminton fully booked so we played table tennis. Played for a while saw a court in badminton was empty n we ran to it. Played for a while then the advanture club ppl needed to use the space for something so we returned to playing table tennis. Sean left for swimming, siyan left for kendo. Only left the three extra talkative 1's. Then a gal asked if she can join us. Being gentlemen(at least i was, dunno bout the other 2), we of course agreed. The two of them took turns to play with the gal. Could see tt they were hesitating to smack cuz afterall we r playin against a gal. Played until 8 pm then we went to shower. Showering after exercise feels so great. But once again the blur side of mi have to resurface. I only remember tt i did not bring a towel after i finished showering. Had to use tissue paper instead. Weian was even more funny, i nv seen a person who can shower without getting his hair wet except him. His reason.... he did not want to mess up his hairstyle. Left sch at 8.30, must have been the latest i ever had. Then had to walk the underground(sort of) passage way which links the sch to the mrt station. It was so bloody dark ..... so scary.... u could not see wat in front of u. Weeleong was complainin bout the sch being cheapskate. Left sch went to terminal n took a bus home. Well i guess tt a nice end to my hectic 5 days. Hope the weekend is much better although i noe sunday gonna be a real hell of a day for mi. Cuz i noe some1 gonna get hurt cuz of mi.

I actually planned not even to come to school today but the guyz seemed intent on going bowling so i just came along. Reach the bus stop only to see my bus ran away ..... not so stupid as to chase it since i planned to be late -wahahahahahahha-. Waited for a very short while then another bus came so i hopped on. At the bus stop after mine fadhil came onto the bus. He saw mi n sit next to mi. We chatted a while bout my personal problems n i felt much better after talking to him. After a while Leon(tt guy from our orientation with the lame jokes) came on and he identify fadhil n i so he came to chat with us, talked bout life in sch, stuff going on in SCL, how the MB ppl cut their mouse, movies , pool, bowling and generally life. Then while we alighted at the bus stop near the sch, we started tokin bout tt stupid YapB.T n how gay he iz. We were laughing like hell bout it. Plough through 2 hours was crappy S.P in which i slept half the time n spent the next half tokin. Went FJ next to have breakfast. Ordered mixed vegetable rice n rocky mountain. Ate less than half of the rocky mountain cuz i'm too full. Weian n sean were complain bout how mi n wee leong r wasteful. Did not really catch wat they were saying cuz i was looking around the place 4 her just in case she's around. Had my swelter hood prepared just in case she's around. Went to play badminton next, Walked there n then back again cuz i did not bring my pass. In the end had to borrow ya ling's pass to enter the sports hall. Played badminton with the guyz... had so much fun making a fool of sean n wee leong by making them run all the around the court to chase my shots *lol*. Then siyan the pro had to break up the fun. He told them my weakness n then i started losing. Weeleong and sean just won't let mi rest as they said they wanted revenge. I guess wat goes around cums around. Went bowling next. The first set every1 was like bowl for fun. The second set then every1 started gettin serious (well actually every1 but mi). Not really in the mood to bowl so i just any how throw. Then tt said the loser has to strip so i got serious in the last set in order to catch up. In the last set i finally got serious n well i got back my normal standard.I got 4 strikes n then every1 was shifting their attention on weeleong cuz now he got the lowest score. I extended my lead by bout 20 . I got caught up in the wee leong thing n then i started bowling like crap again. Making funny shots and stupid actions. But omg i can't believe it man Weeleong Caught up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In the last 2 bowls he suddenly on form!!!!!!!!!! I started to panic n then my throws became worse. In the end overall i still got last. Think i lost to weeleong by 4 points overall. I Can't believe even now man. After tt we went to eat n then play pool.

I dreaded going into those big warehouse stores. It took forever to get to where I was going and it hurt the whole time,\" says Bellevue, WA resident, Roger Lewis Posey, who\u2019s suffered from bursitis in both heels for more than 10 years. \" I hated using those electric scooters that the stores offered because I knew that I might be using one when someone who needed it worse would be without. I could walk; it just hurt\u2026a lot.\" Millions of people like Roger suffer from chronic and debilitating pain in their feet, legs and back, even after years of trying everything from cortisone shots to surgery. His relief came after trying on a pair of funny-looking shoes with a large steel spring in the heel, called Z-CoiL\u00ae Pain Relief Footwear\u2122. \"I am now walking much farther now without the pain that I previously endured. I also noticed that I\u2018m not suffering as much back pain as I did in the past with \"normal\" shoes,\" Roger says. \"It\u2019s hard to believe that something so simple would change my life so much. I now strongly urge anyone who suffers from foot or back pain to try these shoes.\" This revolutionary line of shoes is now available at a store called Feel Good Footwear! located 13281 NE 20th in Bellevue. Open since April 5, dozens of Z-CoiL customers are already experiencing pain-reduction and increased mobility. On June 14, owner Dr. Timothy Young and store manager Jeremy Brock will be having the store\u2019s official Grand Opening! Specially engineered to alleviate foot, leg and back pain, Z-CoiL Footwear features a unique conical coil steel spring in the heel, which acts as a shock absorber, greatly reducing the impact to the body that typically causes pain and injury. This spring suspension system, combined with a rigid built-in orthotic support and extra forefoot cushioning, cradle the foot in comfort. People suffering from such conditions as plantar fasciitis, heel spurs, lower back pain, and arthritis, report either complete relief or a significant reduction in pain when wearing Z-CoiL Footwear. Getting over the initial look of Z-CoiLs is well worth the pain-relief. \"They looked a little strange to me. They felt strange too,\" Roger says. \"What I mean by feeling \"strange\" is that they were so comfortable.\" The first Z-CoiL\u00ae prototype was designed in 1989, when founder Al Gallegos embarked on a quest to build himself a better running shoe. He wanted to reduce the pain caused by years of impact from running. After seven years of designing, testing and patenting, Z-CoiL\u00ae Footwear officially opened its doors in January 1996. Since then, Z-CoiL\u00ae Footwear has achieved popularity with people in pain and the number of dealers across the country reached more than 220. Many podiatrists and orthopedic specialists are starting to recognize the amazing results Z-CoiLs are bringing. Dr. Timothy Young of Bellevue began selling the footwear originally through his podiatry clinic because of their wonderful benefits. \"I found that Z-CoiL shoes are most effective for people who do a lot of standing or walking on hard surfaces, such as concrete slabs or a warehouse type of environment,\" Timothy says. \"This could include virtually any position with a weight-bearing job function in health-care or retail.\" This amazing line of footwear is available in Bellevue \u2014only at Feel Good Footwear!

Myself, I've kinda always been the middle man, a cross of all my friends dipped in acid and covered in nappy curly hair. Well, My friends and I have all had our problems, typical teengoth probs really, depression, relationship trouble, lost religion, lost reality...etc. None of us ever did drugs. For the most part we are all against drugs. Then one of my friends, the artist, met a guy. This guy was a big time stoner druggie, but despite his drug problems, we were happy for our friends for finding a guy. The guy managed to turn our girl into somewhat of a wreck. Ive heard rumors, and witnessed myself enough to belive he turned her to drugs. The artist girl started treating one of the 2 goths like shit, and practically mocked his problems, not cool. Now my artist friends has pretty muched gone away, and I'm left with only 3 friends.

I am also a year older!! Eh, but what a horrible last day of 16 it was...... That night, it got a lot better though. For one, my parents gave me money, and money is good because I can buy stuff. Good times. Also, I was still really mad so I found someone to talk to and just dumped all my problems out and told her what I was feeling......and it helped a lot. She listened and gave me advice that really helped, which is what I needed. It was basically just a b!tch-fest, and I was doin all the bitchin. But she listened, and she is awesome for it. So Thursday, my birthday, was really cool. Everyone I ran into seemed to know it was my b-day, which is a good feeling. Even though practice was at 5:50 AM, I felt as good as I had to be at practice all year. I was on fire. Hit 5 of 9 three's in one sequence. So from Thursday to Friday......wow. Well Friday itself was fine, nothing unusual.......then fast-forward to the game. If I could sum it up, I'd say it was the most humiliating experience this season, if not in all my life. We were beating the absolute hell out of this team, yet my butt was glued to the bench. Wanna know exactly how bad it was? A kid who just came back from a 3-week trip to INDIA, where he didn't touch a basketball, played more than me. A kid who was playing his 2nd game on varsity level all season played more than me. I played a grand total of 3 minutes. My time keeps shrinking and I seriously do not know what I'm doing wrong. Especially since coach knew that I was hot on practice Thursday. I don't get it. Oh well. From now on I just have to change my view......if I expect not to play at all, then hopefully I'll be happy with whatever time I get. But trust me, I wasn't happy on the bench if you couldn't tell. I wanted to pull a Bobby Knight and throw my chair onto the court. What a pile. And then after the game I acted like a jerk; I blew people off and stuff thinking that I was cool. The person who just helped me out told me good game, and I was so pissed I didn't even respond. I feel like a total idiot. A big apology to that person. But after the game, about 10 guys came to my house for my party. It was alright, we just relaxed and played video games and watched TV.......crap like that. My parents weren't there, which was pretty cool....we got to stay up as late as we wanted without them nagging at us. Today was alright. Practice was the same as always....I didn't say anything about the game last night; I still don't want to think about it. What a waste of 2 hours. Bleh. After practice we went to Amore's and listened to more of Devin's extremely perverted fantasies, haha. Good times. I didn't do anything tonight really except go CD shopping because everyone was either gone or really tired from staying up late at my house the night before. We have Monday off, but we might as well be going to freaking school, because practice is at 8 AM. WooHoo!

It seemed like it would never end, and we were in one gym with both of the other team so it was chaos a lot of the time. Bleh. We got home at 6. And what's worse, we ran freaking sprints.

We had a 14-0 lead in the 1st and ended up losing by 10. I just hope everyone's there mentally tomorrow. I think we will be fine, but Harvest has a few athletes and they will challenge us.

I went into it thinking that I was just going to get even more tired of basketball, but it ended up really fun. Lots of funny crap (Devin getting owned by Kody was freaking hilarious! Sorry Devin).

Anyway, my team was down by 9 when I switched with Ryan, and then we got to a point where the team I WAS on was down by like 17. They came back at the end, with the help of the scorekeeper, aka our coach. Good times. My hamstring still hurts. Everytime I take a long stride, I get kind of a sharp pain. It's nothing big, just a strain, but I figured it would go away by now since it happened on Tuesday. Well I'm still thinking about prom and I'm just as confused as I ever was.

I don't know what our deal is, seriously. Maybe it's Coach Reich subbing us in and out every 30 seconds, maybe it's the fact that we just don't hang out with each other off the court...I don't know, but we suck at talking to each other and playing as a unit. I hate it, too, because we are the most talented team in our district, but we almost choked up a game to the worst team, Bethesda. We ended up winning by 19 or so; I played a grand total of 9, count 'em, NINE, minutes. I got subbed out on two different occasions in the 4th quarter and I didn't even start that quarter!

A guy spoke to us named Mark Cahill, he had some interesting insight.....and man this guy had a ton of stories about sharing the Gospels to other people. It was a great 'wake-up' call to the whole school I thought, because even though we all strive to \"walk the walk\", we really haven't cared about others enough to help them come to God...... I'm fearing another one of those \"spiritual highs\", though. Last night, our homework assignment was to share the Gospel with just one person.......and a lot of people did it, which obviously is awesome. But that's just one night out of 365.....what's gonna happen after a full week of school next week? Are people really going to make time to go witness? Are people really going to care enough? It's time for us to realize that we can't just get up for God when we're forced by the school to spend time with Him.......having things like SOW is great, but what would Faith be like if everyone lived out their walk everyday? Would we have all the gossip, hatred, envy, etc etc et that we have now? Definitely not.....I know that I'm guilty of delibrately disobeying the rules, and I'm speaking to myself and everyone else here.....but the feeling we got today CAN last a while, if people would stick with it. Unfortunately, most of us are just too \"busy\" to do that..... And another thing is, I think sharing requires a deep knowledge of the Bible....and almost nobody at our school has studied it well enough to get into a logical debate about religion or philosophy. It's sad, really, because we have a class specifically devoted to Bible, yet that's the only 50 minutes of the day that most of us spend digging through it.....and even then most of us react by treating it as busy work....we never really bother to interpret it to our own lives. So what happens when you're talking with a Muslim, or a Baha'i, or a Mormon, and they want to specifically know more about your God or Jesus or the Bible's prophecy......\"I don't know\" isn't an acceptable answer to them. It just worries me that so many people have inherited 100% of their parents' political and social beliefs, so they could always do the same for religion.....

Then getting back will be pure hell. Pray that it doesn't happen! Valentine's Day.....woohoo, should be fantastic. The girls are playing @ Pantego at 6.......go support them. That's about it I guess.

I surprised myself by not having a single turnover, but I wasn't shocked when my only 3-pointer sailed over the rim. Go me. The girls also won. They beat Midland Trinity by 11 I think.........great job yall. Tonight, I went to Barnes Noble, then a few of us went to my house to watch American Wedding......it would've completely sucked without Stifler. But with him, it was pretty damn funny. And today pretty much sealed my fate as far as prom goes..........I don't think I'm going. I left this person a message, and by some miracle it actually got returned.....but there was just no interest; I could tell when her last words were \"See you Monday, I guess.\" Yeah, it's kinda rough, but it's nothing she did....she just tried to be nice to me and I took it as something more. When she backed off, I tried harder to make it work and only screwed things up. So it's my fault. People tell me that I can always find someone else, but this just seems different.......for the past few weeks, she's been almost all I could think about; I don't even think she remembers my name sometimes. The whole ordeal is worthless now. But I tried, I guess. I don't know what it is with me; I always try to force things in relationships. I'm so impatient that it's no wonder I haven't had a serious girlfriend since the summer after freshman year. Sometimes I try to force things just because I know the girl isn't the purest person on the planet, but this situation wasn't anything like that.......I looked at the situation, and once I heard some stuff that she said LAST YEAR, I made things out to be more serious than they really were. And I forced stuff. I tried calling so many times, that I should have figured out by tonight what was going on. She was trying to give me some signs, but I was to stubborn to read them.

It's made me stay up past 12 almost every night, but I really wouldn't have it any other way. The only thing is that I've had a pretty hard time keeping up with my schoolwork, but it's not that huge a deal to me. God has really blessed me with some great friendships that I am really thankful for. Life is good, no matter what my circumstances may be at any given moment. I decided that I'm going to fish on Lake Whitney instead of going to prom. Yeah, going fishing instead of going to prom may seem a little trashy/dumb, but you know what, I'd rather be on a lake hangin with my cousin instead of at some country club trying to avoid all different types of awkwardness. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I hate prom or the people that are going to it; it's just that I'd rather not spend this next month stressed out over it. Well Spring basketball is about to start up.......really pumped about that. It sucks that our tallest player won't be playing with us next year, but we gotta start now if we want to make up for losing him. If we get nothing else out of this I hope we learn to stop acting like a bunch of little girls when stuff doesn't go our way. Our chemistry sucked last year; it's what kept us back in a lot of games (most notably Harvest). This spring and summer will be huge for us and I really can't wait to start focusing on basketball again. I miss basketball season like crazy. Ah well, still got one more year. Spring Break.....has been crazy so far. I've played basketball at 2 AM, been all over the Metroplex, and had a toilet overflow and it's remnants pour down onto my kitchen floor downstairs. It's been memorable to say the least. I'll give a more detailed update on that later. Well I'm off......hope everyone enjoyed their Spring Break! Death Cab for Cutie at Tree's April 26!

This last month has been the most turbulent one of my life, no question. I've experienced so many different ups-and-downs, and even though sometimes I wish I were just void of emotion, I can honestly say I really don't regret anything. Maybe there's one thing I might change, but ya know it wasn't the right time or situation.....I messed it up. But this person has been nice enough to stick with me through all that's gone on and I love her for it. Anyways.......yeah, life has been fairly busy. Prom activities were this weekend, so I asked Janelle to go with me, about 3 weeks before. She was really cool about everything and said yes which is nothing short of a blessing. I really didn't get to talk to her too much before prom, but that's okay. We both had a lot of stuff going on and our paths don't cross very much since she is almost never at school.....yup, I'm jealous. So the day comes.......and oh my goodness.....we joked about Janelle being royalty but she looked so incredible.....literally like a princess. She was absolutely gorgeous. Put me and my gross hair and semi-gay tux (seriously, why did I choose the vest? That's gonna come back to haunt me when the pictures come in) to shame. Yeah....she was amazing. So we took pictures at my house for all of 5 minutes (haha we only posed twice), went to the Hubbard's and took a lot of pictures, and then went there. My mom let me borrow her Infiniti and that is a pimpin ride G.......fo rizzle. Once we got there we kinda sat around and then ate....food was pretty good. Then dance time.......like I said, I got to dance with the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen, so how could that be bad? It was really cool.....although I am by no means a dancer, I had fun. It was definitely worth it. And to top it off, Janelle got prom queen....how cool is that? That's def something I can brag about when I'm a complete loser in college a couple years from now. After the night was over (went to bed at 4, earlier than I had imagined), we got up bright and early to go to Lake Granbury.......and wow, that was a blast. They had 2 different houses, one for the guys and one for the girls......that was kinda self-explanatory but oh well. We stayed out on the lake most of the day and then ate and came back and watched Cheaper by the Dozen......dare I say, overrated? Oh well, it was cool.....extremely relaxing. We got back at about 1:30 today and I just passed out. As fun as the entire weekend was, it was also draining. So that's where I'm at right now........very happy that everything turned out and that I got to go with Janelle. She is awesome! And I'm glad we're on the same page now; we finally established that we are better than everyone else and we can move on with life, haha.

I've gotten to the point where a lack of sleep really doesn't bother anymore; I can function just fine on just a few short ours of rest and I don't mind getting up early at all. I owe all of that mess to this year, my junior year of high school. To say the least, this has been the most eventful 9 months of my life. I guess I will just start with the first half of this year and what I learned from it, since the second half is at least an entry or two all by itself. I guess I should start with football. It was pretty interesting this year; definitely had it's ups and downs. Some of the ups......mostly involving meeting new people and the rush of Friday nights. I still haven't forgotten the one freaking pass that got thrown to me on varsity. I got 20 yards out of a 5-yard route and I didn't get the ball for the rest of the season? Grr..... I got put on JV too this year, which I guess was a blessing and a curse. I liked it because I met all the freshman, and it amazes me how cool these guys are. I was definitely not as mature or likeable at that age as they are; couldn't ask for a cooler group of kids. But then I had to actually play with JV and compete with 15 year olds. That is okay, except for the fact that I know I shouldn't be out there. I ran down 3 different running backs from behind this year; I mean come on. JV games were still fun though, especially when we passed the ball...that was only 1 game but ya know. Homecoming was fun, time spent hanging out after games was fun, all that junk was cool.....but then basketball started up and I couldn't have been happier. I can remember turning in my pads the day after our last football game and being so excited for basketball that I showed up to a JV 'scrimmage' that ended up being cancelled anyways, so I just watched them practice for an hour. I guess the first half of basketball was all about just finding our own identity, which we never really did at all. Instead we decided to focus on what other people were doing wrong, which came back to bite us later on down the road. Of course there was the Harvest tournament.....memories of scoring 90 on Rockwall, and then coming back that night and getting beat 55-18...yeah, that's right, we scored a grand total of 18 points in a basketball game. We didn't score a single point in the 3rd quarter. It was so awful. Nothing like that had better happen to us this year; if it does we should cancel the damn season. And then we started a pretty lengthy losing streak.....which again, I hope doesn't happen this season. We have 8 seniors; how could we screw this up!?!?! I guess school-wise...it was alright. To be honest I don't remember a ton, partially because I was so exhausted from getting up at 6 AM to lift every Monday and Wednesday. I remember the retreat, though. I liked it...a lot. But I don't think I got as high off it as most people did. Don't get me wrong, getting close to God is great, but if you're going to do it that way, you'd better keep that feeling with you when you go back to school. If you level off after just one week at school, you've just wasted 3 days of your life more or less. But I'm thankful that we got to experience it and I admire the way the seniors pulled it off on such short notice, especially with how often they are at each other's necks. I was surprised, to be honest. I made new friends and experienced a lot of new things 1st semester....but that was nothing compared to the 2nd.....\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Today was alright, I guess you could call it the official 'beginning of the end'......the first day of the last full week of school.

Chalk that up on the list of things I would have completely failed because I didn't give a crap to study for them 2) The seniors are gone, a couple thousand miles away, and I don't really have anybody to talk to about stuff......and I haven't really had that since they left a couple weeks ago. I know they are busy with everything but feeling like you are being put off to the side really sucks.

I'm sorry but when did you have a kitchen and bathroom installed into your Beetle/Focus/whatever generic 'girly' car you drive?

Alright so today was the big state girls softball game and I talked my parents out of making me go to school, so me, John, Devin, Doug, and Brad all piled up in the ultra-manly Liberty and headed down to Waco. The ride down was great, lots of laughs and good times and what-not....but when we stopped to eat in Hillsboro we were informed that the field was flooded, and they were looking for another place to play. Don't ask how we didn't figure out that the field would be too wet, I mean we only ran into rain for over half the trip! Still better than school though.... So we decided to go down to Waco anyways in hopes that the game would still be somewhere in that vicinity. Boy were we wrong.....ended up being 45 minutes south of Waco. At that point we all lost any desire we once had to watch girls' high school softball and bailed. It was still fun and definitely worth it, since we didn't enter into a single classroom all day. Doug and I did decide to go to football today, though, which also was pretty fun...football has a lot of down sides, but nothing beats getting on the field on Friday nights. At least that's what I've been told.... Today when I got home, I kinda wondered...what makes us that much different than any animal? Mainly I'm talking social relations, and how females are treated.....back a couple years ago, I saw a show on the Discovery Channel on an experiment that scientists performed on male and female chimps.....they were each given 4 chips: purple (grape), orange (orange, duh), red (apple), and the best, yellow (banana). They kept the males and females in the same environment for 2 weeks...and by the end of the 2 weeks, the females all had the banana chips...is this a coincidence? Of course not. Why is it that guys have to do all the providing and pleasing in a relationship? Honestly, I understand that males are supposed to be the 'aggressors' or whatever, but how do we know when we've gone too far or when we haven't done enough. Girls say guys are hard to figure out....but do they have any idea how manipulative or secretive they can be? I mean when guys have an issue, they usually deal with it up front....girls will think of the most devastating revenge and go through whatever means possible to attain it. And sometimes girls really don't know what they can do to a guy. They send signs without meaning to.

It's been a blur but it's also felt like forever since last summer. I want out of school so bad.....but then again I don't want to leave, I don't want the people who are graduating that I am close to forgetting about me and taking on a completely new identity. Sometimes it seems like there's no such thing as life after high school......maybe that's because there isn't. There's no such thing as the life you are accustomed to anymore, at least. From now on YOU are responsible for everything you are involved in. You make the decisions, you run the show. Why do people seem so ready to accept all of this? Are people really naive enough to believe that high school is the worst period of their lives? Seriously.....social pressures can suck but look at all your options....you can basically get away with whatever you want (unless it's extremely illegal) and you get off scot-free. This summer will be all about facing reality for me.......people whom I've only begun to know yet I feel so extremely close to are leaving, for good. There's no coming back to high school; maybe that's a good thing but it almost feels tragic in a way. I'm glad they will be having the time of their lives off at wherever they may be, but this is the end of the line as far as a close relationship goes. I've got one more year and the last thing I want to do is waste it worrying about people who have moved on, but after these past few months I dread the thought of moving on myself. The sucky thing is I know I did this all to myself.......everything that I will be experiencing at the beginning of next year is because I committed way too quick and didn't realize that there wasn't anything I could do to change the way people felt about me. It's going to suck in August when I look for that familiar face and realize she'll never be there again..... Well having gotten that off my chest......life isn't too bad I guess. 3 more weeks plus an exam week and school is over with. Couldn't be happier about that. Football is supposed to start back up next week and I'm pretty excited. Don't know what the heck we will do next year, but at this point I know we don't really have anywhere to go but up. Plus get this......we are going to PASS *gasp* the ball next year! Unbelievable! To be honest I'm a lot more excited about basketball.....I mean who wouldn't be?

It went pretty good; I was confident but then again you can never really tell how you actually did on those things. That night.......I lost all masculinity and caved in to go see \"13 Going on 30\". Yeah, I know you're going to rag me for it....but in all honesty it wasn't horrible. Cheesy? Oh yeah....but not overly sappy. Plus, Jennifer Garner + lingerie + short skirts = sex.

It's not wrong to want to be heard, though. People cast out signals about how they are feeling constantly, and our smarter/more perceptive friends catch them immediately. My question is this: Why do we try and hide what's going on in the first place? Are we really that naive to think that God doesn't know how messed up we are? There's a God with a direct line open just for you, every time of day. Sure, your friends will tell you, \"You can call me anytime, I'm always here for you.\" You know, I haven't met one person who has been able to live up to that promise. It's an overused cliche, and one that I'm just tired of hearing. Still, we buy into it with all of our heart and when that person's not around, we're crushed. I personally have hit some rough sailing, and haven't had too many people to talk to about it, since everyone has been gone. The main thing is that I'm no longer a close friend of a person who I put so much stock in. I don't know what the deal is; they have been gone a lot, and when they've been here they've mainly been around one person. Maybe things have just been hectic; maybe I'm not what I used to be in their eyes...but why should I let that affect how I view myself or how the rest of my life is going? Once again, He's always there.....and it's not like you have to have your thoughts organized. Dump it all at His feet and you'll be surprised at how organized (and ultimately, insignificant) it comes out to be. And just because things are rough between you and someone who once was close, don't take it as a sign that things are over. \"A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.\" -Proverbs 17:17~ Of course, if this person has no desire to lend you assistance when you're weak, then why attempt to make them? Some people are so wrapped up in their own situation that they constantly remain clueless as to what you're going through. Forget them before you try too hard and get too involved. IT IS NOT WORTH IT! no matter how strongly you feel about the person. Above all, hold no friendship above the one you have acquired with God. He treasures it more than anything else; He has His own Son's blood shed to spend the rest of time with you. You don't even have to pay a fraction of the price He did, and He doesn't have the human knack for letting people down.

It's like finding out for the first time that the stove in your kitchen is hot and your mom tells you NOT to touch it. Yet that just piques your curiousity even more. It's really amazing to me; I've done this so many times because I hold out hope for false ideals, assuming that 'if I want it bad enough, it will happen'. When am I ever going to let go and let God? He's always ready to help us discover the meaning behind our feelings, yet so often we try to understand them ourselves, without so much as even an outside perspective. What's the point of using one's own knowledge when at his disposal is the wisdom of the Creator of him and everything around Him? The 2nd half of this year has been largely about understanding this whole concept for me. I have held on to something for SOOOOOOO stinkin' long, and because of a promise I made to her, I can't really even reveal anything about it. I guess it started after we played Notre Dame way up in Wichita Falls....I got home and took a chance, hoping I wouldn't be ridiculed for starting a conversation with her. Much to my surprise, things went really smoothly; I hadn't felt that way around somebody new in so long. Also to my surprise, it didn't just in there. We talked just about every night this semester; I got closer to her in a quicker amount of time than any other person I've ever known. Everything was just so.....comfortable. I loved talking to her, no matter what time or what the subject was. One night I could tell something was wrong but she kinda skirted around the subject...then the next night I asked again and everything was spilt. And my heart broke for her; I genuinely felt pain for what she had to endure and what she was still going through. And I let myself become totally wrapped up in the situation, which is just wrong. But it happened. And we kept talking. And I grew closer. Then I committed the cardinal sin......I mistook what I meant to her. I was in over my head; Lord knows what I was thinking when I decided I really had feelings for her. Once again, just something I should've let go of at the outset instead of letting it fester inside of me. A lot of stuff happened to me and her during that time, which certainly didn't help the whole 'me letting go' thing. And then it happened.....I blew my cover. I revealed what had been bothering me for the last few weeks. And even though I KNEW what she would say and what she wanted, even though I KNEW what the consequences of it would be (almost all were negative), even though I KNEW that I would be shattered at hearing the words \"I just don't feel that way about you,\" I proceeded. And I was destroyed when all I had predicted came true. I didn't sleep that night. Or the next. And from then on, most of the time when just the two of us hung out somewhere, the time I valued more than any other, pretty much stopped completely. Like I said, I knew the repercussions of my actions beforehand, yet I decided to do it anyways. So stinkin' foolish. This happened in April, and I'm still in the middle of dealing with it. Still trying to understand why I did it, and why things have changed so much. Still wondering what I'm supposed to do to get my mind off her when I try and think of someone to call and have cheer me up. Because it won't ever be like that again. In two months I will be an afterthought to her. I exaggerated things and made it out to be more than it was supposed to, yet I never imagined I could be this devastated over someone I just met 5 months ago. To that person: I know you'll never believe me when I tell you how much I treasure you. I'm sorry I had to harbor those feelings for you; I completely regret it because I knew all along it would end in heartbreak for me, but I proceeded anyways. And fell into a pit which I can't climb out of myself. This pain has engulfed me; I can't understand why I care about you so much but I love everything about you. You have served as an example for me in terms of Godliness and have been such an encouragement. I also know that you can't ever get as close to me as I want you to, and you wouldn't want that anyways. I hate the fact that I chose such an inconvenient time and that things never seem to work out as far as us spending time together goes. Maybe it's for the best, I don't know; leaving things in His hands is hard but maybe this is what He wants. Whatever happens, I won't forget ya and I'll never stop loving ya.

Constantly. I had warm nachos with cheese at the cinema! I love nachos with cheese. At the cinema. And warm. Wanted to go see McFly play free in the Trafford Centre, followed by a signing afterwards, but by the time I got home from work experience it wasn't worth it. Probably would've been packed. And my mum-of course-couldn't be bothered. *ze sigh* Had work experience again today. A liiiiiiddle bit boring. Especially as there's these two new kids my age there, they know eachother so can work together on one computer, and they aren't a fraction as shy as I was (and still am). I have very stupid and serious people issues. It sucks. So there weren't any machines for me to use, and nothing for me to do (oh yeah-I'm at a newspaper) until the last hour I was there. This happened yesterday too. And will happen all week. Shit. I walked down to Runcorn's new Kwik Save in my lunch hour and bought Top Of The Pops magazine. Yay. I noticed their stock is already declining. Didn't see that coming *smirk*. I ended up reading TOTP on the car journey home instead though, because I was too fucking shy to ask anyone there if I could read it while sitting around. This is just stupid. My mum's taken me to several psychologists over the past few years and they've all been cunts. Finally we went to this one woman who worked by asking questions and stuff, which was better, but seeing as I can't even talk to people I'm not familiar with, we quit that one too. So I'm screwed, basically. Worked on my Scissor Sisters Street Team forum (not open yet). Will probably get sued for copyright, but hey. I can't see it happening honestly, because I'm a familiar face...username...on the forum. So they already should know I'm not a malicious kinda person. I hope. Am I? No! Noooo....Nah.

I asked him. He started patronising me horrifically. Going on about a new model of iPod coming out around July/August. I've done endless research on this for god's sake. He was referring to a mini iPod which I decided long ago was rubbish. It's just a gimmick and pretty much the same price as a regular 15GB iPod. I am far more technologically-inclined than my dad.

Not a couple of random off the handle jabs at their person, but more of a carefully studied and calculated approximation of why they were there. Funny enough we both came up with about the same things, just worded differently. We talked about some of our opinions on the world. Sometime before I had to wake up my girl we got a little more serious. Along the lines of why I like him. Sometimes he comes across quite blunt, borderline mean about some tings. I just figured out why he does, with me at least. I know why he is that way towards others. I believe he gets as harsh as he does to see if he can shake me, to see if I am just playing. Well thats the best I can think of how to word it. I am patient and don't take it personally. I answer his questions honestly and as best as I can. Many times words fail me. It gets frustrating when words fail me. I don't feel like I am conveying my thoughts and feelings clearly. I suspect that he understands what I was trying to say. He is more than pleased that I answer all of his questions. And that I do so honestly. Sometimes shyness trips me up. I truly enjoy his intellect. His mind and thought process are most appealing to me. Kind of like setting out a dish of the finest cheeses to a conisiour. He rounds it out with a wicked sense of humor. A cutting one if you will. A very intellectual humor, and that is something I cherish. He thinks he isn't funny, but he shouldn't be allowed to judge ourselves. We are our own worse critic. Quite often we look for things to tear down, we force ourselves to find something wrong where there is nothing. His personal morals are quite high. He has his own opinions formed by himself. Not forced upon him from an outside force. They are ironclad. Held firm within his very being. I respect that. He has so much of my respect. I don't know if he will know how much I truly respect him. I have come to some profound discoveries. Ones that are deeper than I had once thought. It is most essential that someone fulfills deep needs in you. Needs that you can only discover through thorough searching. I must have someone that makes me laugh, and not just at \"fart\" jokes. I need someone that stimulates my mind, and makes me think. I need someone that is willing to hear my point of view, and not tell me it is wrong. I need someone that understands that I feel hurt, and maybe there isn't anything they can do about it but be patient. It probably isn't their fault. I need someone that understands that I am not perfect, but treats me as though I am. I need to feel needed, wanted, desired. Probably in that order, and not overbearing in any of those areas. Someone that can see through my mask. The smile isn't always real. It just catches me off guard when it is seen through. To know what feelings or thoughts are residing under that mask. I don't know who or what I am yet. I only know part. Nothing is more rewarding than someone that can see from the outside, peeking in at what lies there. Give me a different perspective, maybe more clarity. I should know who I am. But I don't. My entity was nearly destroyed. I am once again coming out of my cocoon, but not as before. I am harder, scars run deeply. Maybe someday those scars will fade as the ones on my skin have. I think I have found that. We will see. Only time can tell. I have dreams about him. Nothing too special, but in their way they are special. Slowly dancing in the living room, in the darkness. Who knows if there is music, I like to think so. It wouldn't matter, but it would be nice. Smiles as I express my individuality by making my hair snow white with muted blue streaks. Arms holding me as I cry at night, as I often do that. I hate crying at night. I hate falling asleep with tears on my cheeks. One day it will stop. I hope. I don't know. I don't like to be alone. I have been alone mostly for the past five and a half years. Surrounded, but alone. Trapped. There are times now that I don't feel alone, even when physically I am. I feel as though someone is there with me. Kind of in the room, but not quite. Perhaps its just a matter of distance. I don't expect anyone to understand my ramblings. On this I am not looking for understanding, just acceptance.

I am terrorfied to let this out for the world to see. What if the person that makes me think reads this? Surely he will know it is he I write about. I do not doubt that he would know. Now my cowardess is gone. If he reads this, and some part of me hopes he does, maybe he will understand me better. These things aren't easy for me to convey. I have been proof reading this and making edits to it all for the longest time.

I was afraid that I would sleep in, and my girl would be late or even miss school. I was worried that we wouldn't be able to find the yellow line with her teacher holding the green sign. I was worried that all kinds of things would go wrong. Of all the silly things I was worried that I wouldn't find the school. Needless to say I did have reason to worry. We rode with Danielle. Mainly to save on cars added to the traffic jam. We didn't have any problem finding the school, which was a silly worry. However we did have a hell of a time finding the yellow line with their teacher holding the green sign. Once we finally found the right yellow line there weren't any kids there. They hadn't passed us in the hall and by the time we got back inside we headed for the class. Somehow they had managed to get from the yellow line outside to the classroom with out passing us. At last the girls were settled into the class. My girl was all up for fitting in and helping out. Dani's girl wasn't quite having the whole fitting in thing. We managed to sneak out so as to not upset the girls. When I got back home I had a chance to reflect. For years I was put down by the very dipshit that tore down my self image when I was little. My ideas brushed aside as if they meant nothing. My opinion was something that was best kept to myself. My ideals were shunned. My very core beliefs were attacked and he would make me feel shame for them. The dipshit dismantled nearly every fiber of my being. It wasn't right for me to feel hurt when he mistreated me. It wasn't okay for me to feel violated when he strayed. It was downright wrong for me to be the one who was right. It didn't matter if I was right, I was made to feel bad because I was right. Even if I didn't make it known that I didn't agree with what he was doing he found a way to make me the bad guy, without me stating or acting once that he was not doing what was right. I was made to feel horrid for suspecting his faithfulness to our relationship. I shouldn't be attractive to the other sex, because that was wrong. I was to be plain, even ugly. I have been fighting hard to reclaim what of me is left. The hurt is there, the anger is there. But it isn't directed at the dipshit, but at me. I shouldn't have let him change me, I should have fought harder. I should have left sooner. I feel so stupid for not listening to that ever shrinking voice inside of me. It said that things were not right. I wonder if the dipshit were here now if I were to be still living. I think back on the multiple times I wanted to end it all. I tried several times. I can't even begin to imagine how many pills I swallowed by the fistful. I can't imagine how many times I tried. Pain erupts from these memories. When I didn't die, but slumbered peacefully I felt a great deal of shame. I wasn't even able to do that right. I wasn't able to do anything right. I wonder if I am now able to do anything right. Goddess please! I cannot afford to see him again, I cannot afford to have him near me or my daughter! With him not around I feel like myself once again, not fully myself, but getting there. If he were to come back I don't know how many times I could fail before finally attaining success. Hot tears roll down my face just thinking about it. I cut myself a couple of times. A small fletchette on my inner thighs. Why did my blood clot so fast? Why did I fail? Another time with a hunting knife, this time my arms. Deep cuts. Again the blood clotted! Why was this happening? Why in the name of all that I hold holy could I not leave him in this manner? I had tried to leave him physically. I packed up and tried to walk out one night. I grabbed my baby, and my bag. I would make it. I was six feet from the door. He should be asleep. I should be fine. I can do it. Fuck. He is in the hallway. He is coming for me, fast. I run for the door. He tackles me. He takes the baby from me. He kicks me while I am on the ground, hard. Pain shoots through my chest. Things black for a moment. Suddenly he is back. He has put the baby in the crib, she is safe I think. He rips the bag off my back and starts hitting me with it. I don't feel it anymore. I close my eyes tight and wait for me to lose consciousness. Another time in that apartment. He had been three hours late picking me up from work. I wasn't allowed to accept a ride home from my coworker Derek, he was male. It was cold and I was wearing a long sweater and thin leggings. I was freezing. Finally he pulled up. He had some stupid carnations, he knows I hate them. He hands them to me. I take them from him. The feeling that this wasn't a good sign slowly growing. He handed me a large box. He had a gift for me. A stupid plastic set of kitchen utensils. Why was he giving me gifts? What was his game? Slowly we headed home. I asked him why he was so late, why I didn't get a call. He grabbed the flowers from me and hit me with them. Quickly a closed right fist hit me in the stomach hard. I didn't talk the rest of the way home. If I were to cry who knew what would happen to me. His driving was scary when he was mad. I didn't want to risk it. Not with the baby in the car. Walking to the door to our apartment I whimpered. I slid the key into the lock and promptly had my head hit against the door. Warm blood trickled down my forehead. No noise. No noise. No noise. Go inside and put the baby to bed. Go into the bathroom and lock the door quietly. Get the first aid kit and look at my head. Sticky hair matted to the area. Alcohol pads clean the area. A band aid placed over the cut and I was okay. I bent down with some pain to put away the first aid kit. Something in the cupboard wasn't right. There was something there that didn't belong. A false back, white cardboard. Behind the cardboard my worse nightmare. The reason he was late. I wasn't the only one for him. My heart breaks into thousands of little pieces and they begin to diminish into a black puddle. I am looking through the pills. There they are. Lortabs. Tylenol 3 with codeine. Tylenol. Ibuprofen. The cup on the sink. I begin to fill it with a mixture of pills. I pour as many as I can in the cup. I take a handful. He is kicking down the door. I only manage to swallow a few. Six or more, I don't know. He is hitting me, making me release the cup and drop the pills. Hundreds of them pour on the floor. He drags me out by my hair. The corner of the dresser hits my shoulder. He grabs something off the dresser and throws it at me. It bounces off me and hits the door jam. It breaks. I know what it was. The lid to my grandma's little jewelry dish. Rage floods my body. I grab the other half of the dish. I was going to throw it at him. I don't know what happened. My hand is badly cut. I can see the bone under the flesh. No hospital for this stupid wife. There isn't any pain. I pack the wound with cayenne and wrap it in cloth. I press it hard to stop the flow of blood. Barry is screaming at me. I don't know what he is saying. I go sit on the couch, holding tightly to my hand. I don't remember what happened next. Do I want to? The things I can't quickly recall seem to be the worse. I don't want to know. Please Goddess don't let me remember. I couldn't handle what my mind has seen fit to block out. Shortly there after I dream of his death. He is in a war. he is shot under the vests opening for the arm. The bullet is hotter than anything I have ever felt. I have seen this dream before. He has died in this dream before. When was it? That first night. I know when I had this dream first. I knew his fate before we were engaged. Maybe thats why for the longest time I fought so hard against him going active. Maybe thats why I looked so hard for a way for him to leave the reserves. At that time of the first dream I refused to see it, I refused to allow him to become a part of that dream. That second time I had that dream I knew what it was saying. He must go active duty army. He must. That is what was fated for him. I next had the dream when he was coming here to Texas. I have lots of dreams, more often than not they are more than dreams. They are glimpses of the past, future or present. You don't want to see some of the things I have seen in the past or present. But I was able to confirm the horrors I saw before my eyes. Bit by bit every part of me that loved him and cared for him died away, like some doomed plant. The plant was completely dead and decomposing when he last beat me. As he choked me, he sped up the decomposition process of that plant that was once love. I felt no more for him. No hate. No love. Nothing. For my dear friends. Please don't hate me for not telling you any of this. I didn't mean to keep it locked away so long. I was more afraid to let it out. I was afraid that you guys would hate me for being weak enough to let him\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "I haven't been to sleep yet. I just wasn't tired. But I do think the time was spent nicely. I did get more than a few good laughs. Plus its always nice to have sweet nothings whispered in your ear, even if its in another language other than your native tongue. I understand enough to get the gist. Plus all the bits I don't know get explained. Nothing that would be improper for children to hear, just sweet things. Makes me feel all stupid and giddy. I don't know. I guess I am more used to not being appreciated, and put down. It's more than nice to have someone that likes and appreciates you, and more importantly lets you know. I have friends that let me know they appreciate me, but its not the same. It's just different. I was starting to feel horridly fat and ugly. Then last night I switched on my cam for him. I was drunk, but clothed. I had to keep getting up to get another drink, or go to the bathroom. I would pause the cam before I got up, one of the things I do when I am feeling ugly and fat. I forgot to pause it once. His reaction was one of awe. He has seen me stand before. I guess that it was better this time because he hadn't seen me for so long. I just felt so good about myself. Kind of like butterflies erupting from their cocoons in my stomach. Most people think this guy is a jerk. I don't think he is a jerk. Just well educated about things. He is nice enough to me, but then again lots of people think I am a bitch. I can get pretty mean about people that don't know stuff and act like they do. He thinks for himself. I like that. He doesn't just go with the crowd. He doesn't judge me either, not for the \"bad\" stuff I have done. Although he does call me a mix between Martha Stewart and a serial killer, can't remember which one. It makes me laugh, because I probably am. It's cute. I am by far the oddest person I know. I would probably suggest an asylum for me if I met myself. One part of me is sure that he wouldn't ask about the dimensions of the sexual organs of previous lovers, then get pissed off an call me a whore. It's not like I sought them out for size and technique. I dated them because they had interesting personalities. They treated me nicely and had that little something that made a part of me somewhat happy. They had respect for my boundaries. I liked them, and they pursued me. Like any relationship between a man and a woman, or any sex partnering. They wined me and dined me. They took their time to woo me like I should be wooed. They didn't just drop trow and show me their piece and hop in the sack. Thats not how I work. They mentally seduced me, then physically. I shouldn't be called a whore because one boyfriend had a large dick. I shouldn't be called a whore because he had lovely red curly hair. I shouldn't be called a whore because he took me on the best dates I have ever been on. I shouldn't be called a whore because I didn't give it up to him for six months. I didn't ask to see his piece first then start dating. Quite honestly; he scared the crap out of me when I first saw him naked. I had never so much as seen an uncut penis until then. Let alone a penis of that size on anything human. I didn't suck his dick or anything, or take it in the ass, or even fit the whole damn thing in me. What the fuck am I getting called a whore for? How would men feel if they were called a whore if they slept with a woman that had a large clit? Jesus Fucking Christ. I answered his fucking question truthfully because he asked, if he didn't want to know he shouldn't have asked. I am not going to lie. I have more balls than to lie. If you really don't want to know, don't fucking ask. It is as simple as that. And by all means don't get mad when you get an honest answer. What the fuck was I supposed to do? See the size of him and say,\"I can't have sex with you, your dick is too big. You kiss like a fucking god, you have the oral skills of a lesbian, I am hornier than shit but I won't have sex with you because future partners may have a huge problem with the size of your penis.\" Yeah fucking right. That would be fucking committable. Lock you away in a loony bin for saying that kind of shit. It's not like it is easy to get me into bed. I was called a fucking ice queen for fucks sake! I didn't give it up to many. Ehh fuck it. Enough ranting of offenses generated by an asshole. I am not here to bitch about that shit, at least not right now. So back to the subject. Oh yeah. Now I remember. It was the neatest thing, we talked about the bible. I just about died laughing. His knowledge of the bible is fucking amazing. I am not Christian, and I practically hate Christians, but I love to talk about the bible. Some of it just cracks the shit out of me. If you take things from the legal stance it is quite humorous. Like for instance; if you have enough goats to kill and crops of wheat to burn you can get away with just about anything. I just about died laughing over that. There is also the whole bit where they are instructed to go out and rape and pillage! Now what if you have to rape and pillage your neighbor and his wife? What happens then? You kill three goats and burn a weeks worth of grain. LMMFAO. Then there is the whole ten commandments part, I love this little bit...The ten commandments were written for the Jews that were there with moses, worshiping the golden calf. Right? Right. So they apply to the Jews that were there, and their children. Any further generations and outsiders should be excluded. Look at it from a lawyer's stance. So all these people running around are not following the proper set of laws. It took us a good hour or so to talk about this stuff, I just condensed it. We talk about weird shit like that all the time. It just cracks me up. I love it. I like it when my mind is stimulated. I could go on for hours about the bible. I have done lots of research on this subject because it fascinates me. Oh, and bible knowledge isn't where it stops with him. He has a vast collection of subjects that he is knowledgeable on. Like psychology. I love psychology. We sit and annalize people. Its just great. His knowledge on the Goddess and her many facets is amazing. I usually have to explain the lesser known Goddess's to people. One day He knew who Dana was. My jaw hit the fucking floor. I was so amazed. Knowledge turns me on, and not just sexually. He knows about my Goddess! I love it. I don't have to explain about The Morrighan. He even backs me up on stuff about her. I fucking love it. Oh God, the man knows about Astrology! Not just the typical shit that some people know. His knowledge is really in depth. He has genuinely studied it. Just a big fucking WOW. Most people that say they know about astrology just know some about their sun sign. Blah, blah, fucking blah. They couldn't plot their birth chart if their life depended on it, let alone translate the fucking thing. All they know is shit like: I am a Taurus. The Bull. I like food, camping, friends, and long walks on the beach. More or less fucking morons in the subject. It is like telling a dentist that teeth are in the mouth. Do they know anything else? No, of course not. For crying out loud, so many people just annoy the shit out of me. Like the ones that try to tell me something in my area(s) of expertise. Give me a fucking break. He knows what drives me insane. He helps me cope with it. It always makes me feel great when he backs me up on something. Always. Like I am on top of the fucking earth. He stands up for me. I really like that. I cannot stand a man who will allow someone to talk shit about their love interest, or mate. Nothing is more cowardly. Nothing, except rape. Which he despises. Death would be better than rape. He stands up for me, and tells others to fuck off. Unlike others have in the past. A certain someone would allow people to trash talk me and say nothing to stop them. That is sheer ingratitude if you ask me. I am not a bad person, and most of the trash was rumors started by jealous women. This guy wouldn't allow that to happen.

If you allow your mate to be put down by other people it is incredibly disrespectful, I don't care if your mate is a fucking psycho. If you don't care about them enough to stand up and say, \"Hey, thats not right,\" you shouldn't be with them. You don't deserve them. And if you allow other people to make advances on your partner it shows that you don't value them as your partner. It shows that you don't care if someone else wants to take them from you.

I was so happy. I felt like a kid on x-mas. Then I went to my mailbox and got the rest of the mail, and I was even happier. There was another package. One with a new BoB.

I don't even want to really get into that. I could just kick myself. I could have gone, for free. I didn't think I had a baby sitter, until well after they all left with out me. Anyhow, my brother let the other brother \"touch up\" his dual Mohawk. He pretty much screwed it up, then tried to cover it up and say it looked \"pimp\" the way he did it. I had a short discussion with Jacob about how he would like it done, and we came to the decision that he wanted the dual-hawks to come all the way to the back of his head and meet in the back like a big V. So I got out the big and shaved away most the stubble putting in the ground work for the V. When his hair grows more I will taper the front a bit so that it kind of comes to a point near the back of his head. I couldn't remember where I hid the hair cutting scissors or I would have done it tonight. I figure if he is going to be a punk he should look good at it. No offence to the gutter-punks, (I have many friends that are gutter-punks), but my brother isn't going to be one. If he is going to be seen out in public, with me a respectable Goth, he will go with a more classy punk style. I had to buy him more clothes too, he looked really....Um...bad. Now he looks more like me...A menace to society. :D Boy, if my neighbors didn't think I was weird before, they will now. Not that they didn't already...I am the freak down the street that yells at them in the middle of the night. That reminds me, I need to do a re-dye of my hair. I am sick of the pink and black. Granted it matches my wardrobe. I am contemplating purple, Goddess knows I have plenty of purple clothes. I haven't had my hair purple in ages. Okay, more like six months. I love my hair when it is black with large red chunks, but for some reason that color combo makes more people stare than neon blue or grass green. I am never dying my hair grass green again. I felt like a leprechaun shat on my head.... I do have this lovely peacock blue that looks good. Maybe I will do that. \"Why does she dye her hair funky colors, does she really want to draw attention to herself\", you may be thinking, but nope. I have attention from being damn near six feet tall, just a mere inch shy. I get stared at plenty for that. At first I guess I started to dye my hair funky colors because of people staring, now it is purely for my pleasure. I love being able to have some odd color on my hair, and nails. Makes me laugh. A lot of the women down here like to give me crap about it. Funny part of it is they have funky hair too. Like the last one that made fun of my pink hair....Half of her hair was pink, to match her outfit I think. My lovely mean streak made me make fun of her. I told her she was just jealous that it was my real hair, and not some nappy weave. She didn't find it as funny as I did, but I wasn't the only one laughing. There were plenty of oogling guys that found it funny. Then they proceeded to ask me for my number : Guys piss me off. I have heard the stupidest pick up lines ever. Everything from that stupid \"did it hurt?...When you fell from heaven?\" to \"You should be a model.\" All I can say to those is, I don't believe in heaven and I was a model, don't want to do that again, I have been dealing with the after effects for a long time. Eating disorders suck. I really think we should do away with the \"Twiggy\" look, its been something like thirty years....MOVE ON! We should go with that \"I am healthy, and won't break in the bedroom\" look. Plenty of men out there like the women that have some meat on their bones, the ones that won't freeze to death in the winter as opposed to the other look. Too many people have been hurt by the desire to be an unhealthy skinny size. It is just ridiculous. Models should not be \"perfect\" and project this image as \"perfect\", there are just not that many people that look like that (and are healthy ). that's my rant on that subject. As I finish my smoke and indulge my latest craving for massive amounts of Tool I think that perhaps, just maybe I can fall asleep right when my head hits the pillow. I have so much crap to do tomorrow. One thing I am looking forward to is spending some time with my other brother, the one not staying with me. I am going to take him shopping for some clothes. Ugh. I just went over the list of stuff I have to do tomorrow, and it isn't pretty. I have to hit up the gym first thing in the morning, then skip merrily over to walmart and pick up some stuff. Mainly deep cleaner solution to shampoo my carpets. From there I must handle business, get that out of my hair. Pay all the bills, then get back home. The brother staying with me has to go mow Danielles lawn, then my back lawn. I have to fix the pool, and fill it up again. Stupid dog thought it would be fun to put a hole in it. Then I don't remember what. Damnit. At some point I should contact my friends and let them know I am not dead. Maybe I will go pick up that fedora I want. Pin striped. It will go nicely with the skirt or the pants I just picked up. I think I would look cute in a fedora, so do many other people. Oh! I just remembered one good thing about guys hitting on me! I get killer discounts at places. I am evil...I got something like one hundred bucks knocked off cause this guy likes me. I dropped something close to three hundred bucks in their till today. This guy is weird, he has this thing about shoes. He likes to always get me a pair of shoes to try on. I have bought one pair of ankle strap high heels and a pair of knee high 28 hole lace-up boots, and he knows my size. That is just really freaky cause they were in different sizes, European for the boots and American for the shoes. European sizes are a bit different. But none the less he knew my size today. I just wish he was gay, that would be nice. He knows all the clothing I have bought there, cause he is always at the store. He's the manager. It doesn't matter what time I go in, he's there. He tries to show me the newest stuff they have in that he is sure I like. I have this thing for pirate stuff, purple/black, red/black and blue/black, and I have a real bad thing for happy bunny. I like the 50's style stuff and pin stripes. Its absolutely evil if there is something like a lovely dress (50's style) that has red pin stripes and a skull with cross bones some where on it. Its like kryptonite. I go all weak and suddenly my pocket is on fire. I generally hate pink, but sometimes something pink/black will just reel me in. It looks good on me and then I am done for. Its weird, me=freak is a good thing, but for my daughter she looks best all preppie style. Absolutely darling. Needless to say we get some odd looks.

Story 1: The Skinny on Wrestling. Sarah, editor of our quarterly magazine MEOW, had the brilliant idea of taking the two least athletic people on staff, and making them participate in various sports for the magazine. This eventually led to The Skinny. In it's final incarnation, Colin Dugdale and I (the aforementioned least athletic people) attend a wrestling (this issue, anyway) practice and observe. Afterward, we get together with the few of the guys, don the uniforms, and wrestle each other. Pictures are taken and everyone laughs at us. (Fun gig, eh?) We've watched the practice, we have to do the stuff and write the story Monday. Story 2: Regime makes (wins, loses, etc.) State. The other girl in both North Star and Marching Band and I are splitting this story because we're the only two people on staff willing to attend the competition. Because of the nature of it, we can't even do interviews until the end of Saturday, and we'll write the story on Monday. Page: I'm always responsible for designing the feature page, usually at least a two day proccess. Because all the reporters with stories on the page got extensions, I haven't been able to start it.

Most of you have probably grown up with linear time, and don't know it any other way, so you'd probably be opposed to changing it. And I'm not suggesting everyone be aware of all points in time simultaneously. That would be mass chaos. What I'm suggesting is that it makes more sense for people to control their own personal time. Whether we want it to or not, the next thing to happen will happen next. Friday will come after Thursday. Two o'clock will come after one o'clock. Causes will have immediate effects. What if you had control over this. Imagine if you could decide that you'd be in SRT than in biology class. SRT would still come after biology, but you would perceive it as coming before. If you put something in your pocket in Biology class, it would still be there in SRT. It's just your perception of events that would change. You may complain this would cause paradoxes. Well, it would. But only if used irresponsibly. If overused it would get quite confusing. The other danger would be the thrill seeker who lived every fun moment immediately and then had only sorrow for the rest of his life. But, if used correctly, this ability would completely eliminate stress. Do you get any of this, or am I just rambling? If you do, that's great.

So, first thing - the beginning of the conversation involved Michael commenting that I smelled weird, which is what 'point taken' was in reply to, as well as all of the shower stuff. Second, all formatting was lost in the posting, but when Michael says 'with Claire?' (7:40:49) it should read 'with Claire? ' folowing the unwritten rule that Michael cannot mention Claire's name without italics. Third- The correct terms for referring to people's mothers: Mine and Nathan's- Carol, Jonah's Mommy, or Ms. Hornbeck (Not Ma Comstock or any variant) Thomas's- Mrs. Fowler, Momas, or Mhomas (Not Tommy! Shlamme's! Mommy!) Michael's- Mrs. Christie, possibly Bonnie Fourth- There is no fourth item. Anyway, news from the other side of the corndog. I know how to use the template well enough to not only add links, but add a totally seperate item to the sidebar - Stories. This will be lots of fun when there's actually more than one. But Marten- this is proof that you should give me mod power so I can make cool, trendy stuff for our sidebar, or just add my blog to the links. Also, Who thinks I should change the name to 'Tales from the other side of the cornblog?' And Now, a long awaited Mtto8: Nathan: *snicker* Michael: Loved the West Wing comparisons. Btw, did you notice how I've been spelling your name correctly? Erin: Yay! The war is over. I feel like we should be tearing down a statue of someone. Lara: Welcome back, how's the book selling? Thomas: Actually, Spinachs do have livers. Atleast, they cloned one that does in a secret lab in Montana.

Maybe his mom picked him up and they moved to Sri Lanka. Sophia - Refrigerator Box? Cool. Also regarding the webcomic comparison.

[ Erin if you were truly offended by my conversations, then well, I think you are as dumb as most of the kids in my Biology class. Convorsations are meant to be taken lightly, and are not a real indication of a persons true being. My convorsations implied that you were bitchy and had a secret thing for Rob Lowe. I don\u2019t actually think that you are bitchy or have a thing for Rob Lowe. I did not mean to offend you. I never knew that you were offended until I got Marten\u2019s message. I pretty much knew it was you, because everyone else knows me, and knows that I\u2019m obnoxious and sort of an ass sometimes, but other times I\u2019m as cute as a little bug\u2019s ear.

It was letter I was supposed to deliver to someone who made a difference in our lives, and mine was full of synicism and young martenesque wit that brought a tear to my eye and laughter to my heart. Dear Andrew, In health we have to write to someone who had a big impact on our life, and i chose you. We're writing these things for recognition. You know, why they matter in our lives. We figure if more people knew that they were important, we would have less people committing suicide, or something. The main reason i chose you is because you are a loyal friend. No matter what I did, you would always try to help, or give me encouragement. Nothing I did would matter, you would always be my friend. I hope it can stay that way. I also chose you because when I get mad I can punch you in the stomach without hurting you... Kidding! Because of all of the above, I present you with this cheap blue ribbon. Remember, it's the thought that counts. I want you to give the other ribbon to someone who made a difference to you, then explain what the ribbon is for. If you don't, I'll have no choice but to not know about it. But please, don't make me resort to stupidity.

Indiana Jones teaches us that it's exciting and dangerous. Stargate teaches us that every artifact you find is a piece of still working alien technology.

Laurence Fishburne: Hi, I'm Laurence Fishburne, and welcome to Jonah's Jovial, Jocular J-post Jubilee. I've been reading Jonah's posts since he began them a little less then a month ago, and they have had a profound influence on me. I spend so much time reading that blog, that I only did one take of each of the scenes in Matrix Revolutions. That's why it was so bad. Keanu Reeves: Also, I can't act! Laurence Fishburne: Anyway, that's why I decided to host this special. And Now, a montage of the best moments of Jonah's fabulous posts. So I'm joining another blog. Don't expect to hear much from me./For whom are we writing this anyway? For each other, for ourselves, or for a theoretical audience?/ I just realized that I am really, really sexy. Like, I-wanna-rip-his-clothes-off-right-this-instant sexy. I am too sexy for my shirt, and for that matter my shoes, socks and pants. I'm so hot, I could melt number 7 plastic./Thomas: Maybe you're name scheme could be that all your entries are called Welcome to Fred. It'd be funny./I was kinda kidding, but whatever./Fighting makes me sad/The moral of this post: Don't volunteer to do two stories in one weekend if you also have a page to design and the paper gets sent to press Tuesday!/But we were winners anyway, because we drink milk. In other news I'm wearing a birthday hat. Yay!/Huzzah! Doom Sporks for everyone! Laurence Fishburne: I guess Montages work better with something other than text! Next, Blog founder Marten Dollinger will say a few words. Marten: Nice work and stuff, I guess. Laurence Fishburne: And now, a musical presentation by fellow blogger Thomas, and his band The Fanny Pack Five. Thomas: (to the tune of a certian Weezer song.) His name is Jonah, he writes really good posts! He's not from Barcelona, but he makes a mean slice of toast! Come sit next to him, Pour yourself some Slim- Fast, like Granma made when you were on a diet Things were better then, you couldn't eat chicken, You gave up that trend when you didn't lose weight. This song is not going as planned, The lyrics suck and should be banned, The rhyming is bad when it exists at all, The resemblence to the original is small, The audience is standing up and leaving, The audience is standing up and leaving, The audience is standing up and gone, Yeah they're gone! (Really cool guitar riffs.) Laurence Fishburne: Well, now that the audience is gone, it's time for Jonah's brother Nathan to say a few words. (That didn't come out right.) Nathan: Jonah's posts have been a true inspiration to me. A few weeks ago, I was planning to develop an addiction to cough syrup or toad licking, because I couldn't take this cruel world anymore. Then, I got on the blog and read those beautiful words, \"Interesting fact about Christen Neary: Her older brother, Stephen Neary aka Parrot Boy, also drew the giant sandwhich which until recently adorned Levi's wall.\" Suddenly, it made sense how wonderful this world is. I've been a staunch supporter ever since! Laurence Fishburne: Thanks Nate! Now a poem from blogger Sophia. Sophia Thanks Laurence. This is a poem I wrote for Jonah. It's called Ode to Jonah. Jonah is cool, Jonah is neat. If he were a food group, he would be meat. Jonah is sexy, Jonah is cute. He melts number 7 plastic fruit. Jonah writes losts of nifty posts, and according to Thomas makes good toast. Life without Jonah would be sad indeed, Like a yard all full of weeds. Laurence Fishburne: (crying) That was beautiful. Now a word from Jennifer Lopez. J-Lo: I don't know this Jonah guy, but I want to talk about what the letter J means to me. Without J, my name would be Ennifer Lopez. The shortening would be E-Lo, or possibly just Lo. Either way, I'm glad Jonah's decided to celebrate this letter. Laurence Fishburne: Now blog writer Erin will perform a freesyle rap. This doesn't sound good. Erin (dressed in baggy clothes and a backwards cap): Jonah is neat, he's a pretty swell guy, He's had 10 posts, that's more than nine. He knows Laurence Fishburne, and that's pretty rad, He draws people in like newspaper ad. This rap's pretty lousy, I won't say it's not, But hey, I made it up on the spot. So way to go Jonah, for 6 posts plus 4, Here's to the rest, to 16 more! Word. Laurence Fishburne: Now, a word from Micheal Christie, who introduced Jonah to blogging. Micheal Christie: Jonah's posts are awful. Originally, he wrote decent posts but now they're all fluff, randomness and meaningless titles. Although, it's nothing compared to the new Matrix. Laurence Fishburne was especially... Laurence Fishburne: That's enough of that. Our final writer, Lara, is in Seattle on a book tour, but she's with us via satellite. Lara, on staticy screen: Jonah bzzt crckle doom spork bzzz fizzle elephants zzt bzzizle 700 fizzz brzzle pop bzzz much. So, bzzz crckle fzzble a really good pie. Thanks Laurence. Laurence Fishburne: Well there you have it, bzzz crckle a really good pie. How better to describe Jonah then that.

(I realize some of you may not have wanted to know that, but when I'm ranting it's hard to stop) My second and much worse fear is talking to answering machines. They're horribly misnamed, because they don't answer. They talk, beep, and then just listen silently. The worst part is, unlike people, they remember everything they hear perfectly. Once you've said it, there's no taking it back. So, normally, if I call someone and the answering machine picks up, I hang up immediately in fear. Sometimes, though, you just have to reach someone. In these cases I'll leave a message. I'll start talking, but the silence on the other end makes me uncomfortable, and I start rambling to fill the silence, until I've forgotten what I was gonna say, at which point I start mumbling and hang up. After I've hung up, I realize how awful it sounds and call back in order to apologize for the first message and say what I need to say, but this doesn't always work as planned either. So, anyone I call and leave a message for thinks I'm a gibbering idiot, and it's all the fault of those dram answering machines.

That's why what I'm going to say is going to be more shocking than the last five minutes of a majorly-hyped Law and Order episode. Sophia and Marten are being childish and need to bury the metaphorical hatchet. You know Marten, you're the administrator of this blog and I respect that. However I think your indignation towards Sophia is covered in crap. Petualantly hiding away and editing posts isn't going to make this go away. Okay, Sophia may have offended a loyal reader. Big Deal. That's not nearly as bad as the time when I told Erin that my post may be so asinine she should \"close [her] eyes and think of England, sweetie. It gets better\" If you would have let this g, talked to her face to face, and I'm not just talking about the Ryan Hagan post, but rather the calling here bitchy, than this would have been a non story. But instead you openly attack her on the blog, which automatically put her on the defensive. Now Sophia's mad and you're mad and the rest of us are caught in the crossfire. But if you insist on starting things, than you better finish them completely, because if you just hide away than I will wait in the tall grass for you, Marten, because you are killing the blog. I'm not saying that Marten was the only one wrong in this argument. I have once (spectacularly) gone off on someone and made mountains out of molehills. But Blatantly attacking a read with no reason given to this sudden outburst is just confusing and apparently unacceptable. If you are going to hate something you need to give a reason, because otherwise you look petty and small. And Believe me, I know petty and small. But you have to remember that I openly apologized and extended an olive branch once I realized that I was wrong and that my comments were offensive and petty. So If you don't stop being \"bitchy\" and apologize to both Ryan and Marten, than you are just as wrong as Marten is, and someday we may look back and realize that Compendium, what was a Utopian Shangri-La for hilarous intellectuals, failed because petty squabbling between the writers. I may be hypocritical for saying this. I might me monumentally out of line. I am pretty sure I looked back five minutes ago and saw that line that you don't cross with an administrator fading away in the rear-view mirror. Marten, If you don't want to apologize, If you believe that you are absolutely right, than I accept that.

While I have mixed views on the war in Iraq, I think that after saving French Ass in World War I and getting Germany back on it's feet after the calamitous forty-year period of War and death had to count for something. The British backing us proves that they are truely the best ally we have at this point. I wonder how long a tangent I can go on before you all stop reading. I think the Spanish Conquistador's behavior speaks for itself. They wiped out two advanced civilizations for gold. I think that was just greed for the point of greed. And look at Columbus. And I don't even want to bring up the fact that we gave them all Syphillis. The Swiss are probably the nicest people in the world at this point. Except for Heidi. She's a bitch. That's my entire view of imperialization. And Nathan (last line \"Especially Islam. If I were them, I'd be mad too.\") I think you meant to say the Arabs who have gotten screwed over a great many times by the west. Although we had no business arming them in Afghanistan back in the eighties, then running away with our tail between our legs after Yeltsen took office. We should have worked with the Afghans, set up a government and then backed away. That (indirectly) led to Terrorist Attacks over the last ten years, including the Apartment Buildings in Riyadah, The American Embassies in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam and the one that hit closest to home, the terrorist attacks on September 11th.

I had no idea how much revisionist history I'd been absorbing. Europeans have only been the big players for maybe six hundred years. The Chinese empire lasted like four times that long. Dar Al Islam lasted almost twice that long. But what do we learn about as kids? The last 200 years. The ones that involve America. Maybe a little about Europe. I've been thinking a lot about my career plans, and I think I want to major in Medievil history and minor in theatre.

You are allowed to lower it from head to chest level for about four beats every three minutes. Imagine this lasts three agonizing miles, while the people you walk by are sitting, laughing, and eating food. Keep that in mind the next time you watch a parade. It's like gladiators - deriving pleasure from the pain of others. Other than that, Arizona was great. 2nd place by a tenth of a point in the field show, 3rd in that cursed parade. Saw the grand canyon, met some cowboys. Met three to six wonderful girls from Maine and got e-mail addresses and even a phone number. Marten suggested I refer to them as Xenophiles in my title because the were strangers who like me. Xylophones is because we have them in our pit. I must say, the grand canyon is absolutely amazing. If you've never been there I highly recommend it. Webcomic recommendation of the whenever is my official new section. I'm going to kick it off with the ever popular Sluggy Freelance. It's got Vampires, Aliens, Ferrets, and the like, but what makes it is the characterization and the quirky humor. The page is www.sluggy.com. The only drawback is the 7 years of archives, but if you find yourself with the internet and lots of free time, that is how I suggest spending it. Thomas- I think you were eaten by a carnivorous moose from another planet. You would be dead, except that just as you were being swallowed a space-time vortex opened and you fell into another dimension, specifically one populated by super intelligent tuataras, who made you their slave. You were rescued by MacGuyver, who was thrown in by a similar vortex, and he created a dimensional flux agitator out of a pair of dirty socks, a toothpick, and some frozen orange juice. However, the agitator wasn't perfect, so you ended up in the right dimension but the wrong planet. MacGuyver made a spaceship out of some rocks, the agitator parts, and a captured turkey-like creature, but there was only room for one, so he left you behind promising to send help. You waited for ten years and then gave up on that, deciding to find your own way home. However, at the discovery of a mostly buried statue of liberty you realized that you were on earth, just in the future. So you spent the next fifty years looking through the ruins of earth technology for a time machine. The best you could find was a youth machine, which is why you still look 16. You didn't find the time machine, but MacGuyver found you. He had realized his mistake almost instantly, but because of relativity it took 60 years of your time for him to come back. He was able to build a time machine with all the ruins you found, so you got back, only you were in New York. Because you had no money you had to work as a taxi driver to raise the money, but while you were driving the taxi you got pulled into a web of mystery and intrigue revolving around a series of murders and a woman named Moreen LaRue. Eventually you solved the mystery and got the girl, but she was run over by a speeding bus, so you returned here because you wanted to forget that other life and it's woes.

I should have my own journal just so that I could write about it, but instead I'll write about it here. It all began on Friday. Actually it began a few weeks ago when my grandmother brought over several pairs of underwear that were to big for her and thought that my mom might want them. She didn't. Fast-forward to Friday. Not having learned a single blessed thing and greatly overestimating my ass, Grandma brought over a pair of her underwear that were too small, thinking that I might want them. I don't. But my brother saw them and started teasing me about possibly keeping them. So, while he was in the shower, my mom prompted me to put them in his bed. I did so. The next day at lunch, I asked if he had found them. Mom said yes, and he had put them on her head. He said that he'd found them at the foot of his bed. Mom told him that during the night they had been in his bed. \"You slept with Grandma's underwear,\" she said. He immediately began to plot revenge. That night, my mom discovered that all of her underpants were gone. Really gone. And in their place was an opera-ghost-like note declaring that there was no point in asking where they had gone, for revenge had begun so beware, etc. Conveniently, my brother was in the shower again. He wouldn't say where the underwear had gone. While I combed the house, my mom turned on hot water in all the faucets hoping to give him a very cold shower. When she realized this would take too long, she filled a cup with ice cold water and poured it into the shower and onto the little miscreant's head. Still, he would not speak. So mom took all the towels out of the bathroom. A moment later she realized that his pajamas were still in there, but by then he had locked the door. At first she tried to pick the lock with a bobby pin, but then we broke out the heavy machinery and removed the doorknob. For some reason this didn't work, and by now the boy was out of the shower. Still no sign of the underwear. That was when he informed me that I hadn't even found out what revenge he had wreaked on me yet. I went into my room to discover what he had done. The worst thing possible was that he had messed with my notebooks or folders or papers that are scattered about my room. He didn't do that. But he did do the second worst thing. He took my teddy bear. If you've ever been in my room, which none of you have, you'll know that I have several stuffed animals. But there is only one that matters. He is the definitive childhood teddy bear. And he was gone. I looked through the house again, but he was nowhere to be found. About fifteen minutes passed. My mom couldn't get the knob back on the door until my brother unlocked it. He couldn't unlock it until the doorknob was back on. So, finally, he held his side of the knob in place while mom replaced her end and he unlocked the door. Then he went to hide behind the shower curtain because he was still naked. Bad move. And he still wouldn't reveal the location of the stolen things. Worse move. We took his pajamas. Altogether, I would say that my brother was in the bathroom for about two hours last night. After his pajamas were gone, he refused to come out. We said we would give his pajamas back when he told us where our stuff was. He said he would tell us where our stuff was when he had his pajamas back. It was a standoff. For me, it had stopped being so much fun when Teddy went missing. I suspect that my brother wouldn't hesitate to destroy the bear if he was upset enough. My mother gave up and we into her room to watch TV, waiting for him to streak across the hall. I sat in the hall and watched the door menacingly, preparing to shoot him when he emerged like I was Natalie Portman and he was a Yankee soldier threatening the safety of the World's Largest Baby. After awhile I realized this was impossible because I had no rifle, so I went into his room again to search. This time I was successful. He had put my poor bear into his bass drum. He had played his damn drum set while poor Teddy was inside! I dismantled the front of the drum and rescued my teddy bear. Mom's underwear was still missing. Mom told me to leave the front of the drum dismantled. After a few more minutes, Mom gave my brother his pajamas and told him to give her her underwear and he was grounded. When he realized she was serious, he did has he was told. It had been locked in a trunk in his closet. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the most exciting thing that has happened in my house since I have lived there. (Wow. Just like Sassy.)

We'll eat pizza (by the way my parents won't be home for some of the time, that does not mean that drinking or other badnesses are allowed) I'm hoping to finish season one of Sports Night. That is my goal, however if you are all bored, we can do other stuff. People need to bring snacks. Erin (if she comes) and Sophia will leave by 11:00 (at my parents behest) and we'll...do stuff. The Comstocks are coming around 9:00 so we'll watch Joan of Arcadia then. Now I know that Erin, Thomas, Sophia and Nathan are unfamiliar with Sports Night so I have compiled a quickie \"previously on\" segment Previously on Sports Night: Casey and Dan were Anchors, Dana was Producer, Natalie was Executive Producer, Issac was managing editor, Jeremy was...something else, Sally was the skanky ho who ran the 2:00 update. Here's where it gets complicated...Casey loves Dana, who is in love with Gordon. Natalie is hellbent on getting Dana and Casey together, however Dana is uninterested because she doesn't think that Casey is really interested in her. Natalie liked Jeremy and they were really cute together. Natalie got sexually assualted by a football player and the crew worried about the fallout, which never came. Now I also know that Jonah, Nathan, Sophia, and Thomas are unfamiliar with Joan of Arcadia so I have compiled another \"previously on\" segment here Previously on Joan of Arcadia: The Girardi family picked up and moved to the titular town of Arcadia, Maryland. Joan talked to God, who appeared to Joan in different (and frequently hilarious) forms, befriended Adam, an artist, and Grace, the militant...I don't know how else to describe her. The dad, Will, was a police chief, the mom, Helen, was a secretary at the school. The older brother, Kevin, was a baseball player who was injured in a car accident resulting in his being in a wheelchair. The Youngest child, Luke is a geeky kid who really reminds me of the Comstocks. Adam's Mom had died. God told Joan to do random stuff, which would benefit somebody in someway (a friend, a child, a teacher etc...) One of these things was to keep one of Adam's (the Artist's) sculptures out of the school art fair, she had a 'failure of imaginiation' and ended up smashing the sculpture with a chair. This worked out badly, as Adam came in just as she did this. So Adam and Joan had a falling out. Eventually Joan and Adam made up after Helen befriended Adam and Grace Helen and Joan intervened and helped Adam read his mom's suicide note, which was pleasant and left good ripples. So Adam and Joan kissed and the world went 'SQUEE!'. Also Grace and Luke kissed at a dance then worked together on the science fair, leading to a really cool Goldbergian sequence of events that lead to the previously mentioned kissing. So they're kind of together. Kevin got a job at a newspaper which lead to him making out with his boss, Rebecca (who is Sydney Poitier's daughter). Will discovered massive corruption at the city level and squealed to the FBI which lead to the dissolution (I think that's a word) of the Police Department. So now he's a Detective and the man who provided the information is the new police chief. Whew! Come at Six, Girls leave at Eleven, Guys leave whenever the next day.

She says, \"Miyah, she looks innocent\". I point to the title of the album, \"Innocent Eyes\", at which point Laurie nods in understanding. \"Oh, right\". It's like Delta's production team were handed maybe three \"keywords\"; tenets that would guide the Delta \"project\" from conception to world-domination. The first word would be \"Innocent\", the second would be (a few words), \"She plays the piano!\" and the third would be \"Fairytale\". Accordingly, the sleave photos have Delta dressed in (innocent) white dresses, playing the piano, and undergoing the process of being \"shaped\" into a star (being groomed, styled, dressed), like a modern-day Cinderella. Born to Try is the theme-song for the fairytale, and the whole Neighbours storyline is meant to function as the storyline that we unconsciously impose onto her (the real Delta's) rise from Port Melbourne lass to pop moppet/singer-songwriter. So amongst this multimedia spin, where is the music? Well, it's in Gary Barlow (yes, THE Gary Barlow), the co-writer and co-producer of about half the songs. With tracks like Not Me, Not I and Butterfly , it seems like Gary's doing a very good job of getting inside the head of a 17 year old girl - which may not be such a stretch, but that's just speculation. The basic problem is that the songs suck, and the whole thing comes across as Celine Dion trying to do Tori Amos. Celine would, of course, be better trying to be Celine, and Delta should be satisfied with being Delta (a talented world-dominating mini-diva) and dump the singer-songwriter \"I play the piano\" schtick. Then we'd all be better off and I wouldn't have wasted my thirty bucks.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "The problem is that there are just too many things to do in a half-arsed way.

Occasionally this creates a nice synchronicity, like when I'm watching ET, reading NW and listening to MJ all at the same time. Usually it leaves me drained and wan.

Steve Martin's jokes, mildly amusing to begin with but then resorted to creepy comments on how he wants to fuck every female celebrity, and that's about all he said for the rest of the night. 3. Every year, presenter's have some kind of really annoying chummy gags with 'Jack' as he's such a good buddy to us all, always!

J-Lo, once again becoming a characterture of herself, J-Lo's stylist: 'hmm, yes darling, this pale jade chiffon will go so well with your tangerine complexion' 5. Michael Moore in one the most hilarious 'simpsons'esque moments I have ever seen: He walks on stage, 'I have invited all the documentary nominees on the stage with me' (crowd gives standing ovation) Michael then starts criticising George Bush and the false election etc. (crowd starts looking at each other) He goes further (crowd starts booing, then because some have started, more people boo and everyone is seated).

What could go wrong? All the ingredients were there: Lopez, romance, a dramatic makeover, and Vanessa Carlton on the soundtrack. As far as we were concerned, this was a watertight proposition. Yet what we found was a film less concerned with offering itself to the Gods of romantic comedy (Sleepless in Seattle, Working Girl), and more tied up in emphasising that Jenny really is from the block. Indeed, in the tradition of Madonna and Mariah 'meltdown' Carey, Maid in Manhatten is little more than one component of many in J.Lo's latest PR blitz; a blitz designed to dispel the myth that Jenny had somehow strayed from her roots. Yes, although she may have dated Puffy, insured her arse and got herself a slow-roast tan to jump on the Latino bandwagon, this girl is REAL. Accordingly, throughout the film, punters are treated to dialogue such as 'You gotta keep it real' and 'I'm from the Bronx'. YES, the girl is real! More worrying were the darker elements of the script that Laurie and I both noticed. Specifically, the fact that to our eyes it was patently clear that creepy, creepy Ralph Fiennes, the male lead, was actually after J.Lo's 10 year old son: 'What's your name little boy', 'Would you like to come walk my dog in the park.

Lead dixie chich singer with bad perm makes one crack at a London gig, saying she's not being thrilled about being from the same state as the man about to launch an ILLEGAL war on Iraq and sales of Dixie Chicks albums fall faster than Michael Jackson's offspring off the 13th floor balcony. Followed closely by death threats against them and their families, huge articles from editors of the lapdog media condemning them and a nation-wide radio blackout. What the fuck is up with that!!!??? Now I'm not a huge Dixie chicks fan but their last album sold 5 bazillion copies so don't tell me that 200 million people woke up overnight and realised their music was crap. I can't stand the fact that Americans are willing to risk nuclear destruction, cold war, vietnam, bosnia and two world wars defending democracy and liberty when they are so keen to give up those exact same liberties themselves, inparticular i refer to free speech. Free speech - the right to disagree with your own governent and not be locked up. The right to protest openly about things you don't approve of or think are right. The right to free, open-minded, critically-minded media that will call the events of the day as they see it and not pander to any political agenda. The U.S government is doing a pretty handy job of reducing civil liberties in the form of terrorist-related constitutional reform. But by jingo's the american public is doing a much better job of taking away their own liberties with small-minded, red-necked and wide-spread social conciousness that says it is unpatriotic to criticise the government, a conciousness fed by both the media and the government. Boo mIchael moore at the oscars, don't watch martin sheen's tv show (even West Wing is the best thing on US TV), stone the dixie chicks, close your eyes and ears.

The best way to maintain a friendship with someone is to sleep with them on at least a casual basis 4. Everyone's life is an exercise in futility due to God attaining perfection with the creation of Adam...Duritz 5. It is possible that scientists anylsing the various forms of fungae growing in the fridge could find cures for various diseases, so for the sake of humanity lets leave them there. 6.

Cry on demand Teach me if you want to Y'know you don't have to, I'll just close my eyes And think of you. - 'Cry on demand' - My favourite Ryan Adams song Apologies for the new habit of lengthy quotes.

She's exactly right, most people who are 'dating' only do it so that they can lay awake at night thinking 'what do I wear to the date?' 'What should I say if they say this?' 'how should I act? like myself? but that would be me being really conscious of being 'myself'....\"WHO AM I?\"blah blah blah' its so completely mind numbingly boring. Yes I am bitter, very bitter. But it seems that the 'dating' phenomenon has suddenly resurfaced out of nowhere, or maybe it was always there, and everybody else has gradually eased into this early 20s maturity and I'm still 'clinging to the gutter' as some people would have you believe. In other news, we didn't get kicked out of our house, thank fuck, it looked dodgy there for a second, but we're here till August so its all good. Song of the Day: 'Live Forever' - Oasis.

Except roll down the window And let the wind blow back your hair. This night's busted open These 2 lanes will take us anywhere We got one last chance to make it real To trade in these wings for some wheels Climb in back, Heaven's waitin down on the track Oh come take my hand, We'll ride out tonight to case the promised land Oh Thunder Road....' - The Boss (sorry, got a bit carried away, gotta love the boss)\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Erin, I think your dating beef sits on shaky ground. 1. not everyone lives in your free-lovin WAAPA world where a quick pash in the corner functions as a greeting and/or introduction. 2.

She replies \"Why do you think people date? It gives people a pointless distraction from the mundanity of their miserable lives. You get something to plan, talk about and think about.

This thing has to stay alive for the duration of my trip, and I'm gonna spice it up, get a load o' people writin' on this, so in theory there should be somethin' juicy to read everytime ya look. I've got beef. I'm disturbed at the amount of 'dating' that is going on in the world today and I'm disturbed at the fact that EVERYBODY has a girlfriend/boyfriend. Pretty soon its gonna be impossible to have my free-lovin fun times with anybody cos everyone is so damn settled and 'happy' that they've achieved their goals in attaining a meaningful realtionship. I for one won't stand for it. I refuse to be in any kind of long term bullshit at the age of 21, when I know that the realtionship won't survive over a maximum of three years, which effectively is three years wasted out of your life when you could have been havin crazy fun lovin times with various people.

Plus the new single better be a cover cos I swear it sounds like an 80s epic ballad. And I just listened to American Life on quality headphones and it sounds wicked though slightly repeditive with crap lyrics, but love the actual music.

I've decided that I'm at the greatest point of my life so far (result of semi-deep convo with Shayne) 4. I seriously am an alcoholic (ah the irony) 5. I've finally perfected my best of Counting Crows CD 6. I'm going overseas in a few weeks and there is the possibility that I might not come back for some time.

Micallef gets total respect for managing to be funny in a comedy-free zone. Delta maintains respect, although there were some quite terrifying off-key moments in Born to Try . If she cut the Mariah-style vocal theatrics, she'd do much better. I totally dig the fact that she takes her shoes off when she plays the piano. She's real. Everything else was pretty much irrelevent, except for Don Lane's kick-arse and crazy speech. The guy from The Panel was about to start bawling.

Ok, some of you may have heard of a few misadventures in central europe, I'd like to clear up a fe rumours. Marnie, Piche, Tiff, Panda and I decided to go to Southside festival in a very obscure little town in southern Germany on the weekend, thinking yippieee lets just go to Germany for the weekend and go to the most amazing festival ever, see wicked bands and comehome on monday in time for flights outta prague to various places. Well, until yesterday all the that turned out pretty fuckin great, even though we were camping for three nights without a tent and me and piche without even a sleeping bag (well, piche had a white sheet but more of that later) so we went to the festival and we were on our third and final train home, crossed over the border into czech republic when the fascist passport police hopped on. Me and panda were innocently fagging in it up in the smoking carrage, calmly handed over our passports, they took one look and threw them in thier case and locked it! we were like 'um...... english?' to which he replied 'Nein!' and walked off. So basicall got kicked off the train and sent back to Germany, so we caught a train to Munich and now we're stuck here til Thursday when we can get a visa, go back to Prague get our shit and get the fuck outta that shithouse city! Anyway.... so the festival... FUCKING AMAZING AND WORTH ANY OF THE SHIT WE HAVE TO GO THRU NOW!!!!!!!! Possibly the greatest, most entertaining, awesome, funniest weekend I have ever experienced, a brief lowdown: FRIDAY: After travelling to frm Prague to Nurenburg to Stutgartt to Tullingen to the festival on trains for around 10 hours we finally arrived exhausted, anxious and delerious, got a full 3 day ticket for 90 euros, walked thru the camping ground realised everyne had deluxe setups of house tents, stoves, eskys, crates and crates of beer and food and we just stood there imagining night time when Piche would bust out her white linen sheet that she stole from the last hostel and lays it on the mud with a little vase of dasies next to her.... anyway I busted a move strait to the stage cos there was no way I was gonna miss Counting Crows. So the fest kicked off with ASIAN DUB FOUNDATION couldn't think of a better group to start a festival with the were awesme and put us in the mood to boogy with Germans, and then...... it seemed like a golden light began to shine on the stage.... ah yes... it was Adam. Of course Counting Crows were awesome, a strange set tho, can't reall remember all of it as I was standing awe but for anyne who's interested: Friend of the Devil, Four White Stallions, Rain King/Sweet Thing, Round Here, Mr Jones, Hangin Around, New Frontier, Richard Manual, Long December, blah blah just a lotta singles really but fucking shit audience who had no idea, that was really hard to get used to, seeing bands who are most loved for their lyrics with an audience who can't understand them. After absorbing that, I had to push myself to focus on RADIOHEAD who were wonderful, I was very impressed because I thought they'd kinda callapse on the ground making wierd noises with various electronics, 'art-rock' style but no, they plaed a little something from every single album with a LIGHTING DESIGN TO FUCKING DIE FOR, in fact lighting for all bands was absolutely brilliant. Hightlight: spotting Adam Duritz up the back of the audience and realising the rest of the band was with him completely drunk, got my photo taken with the whole band! if it doesn't come out I'm gonna die So yeah, after dancing to german pop for a while went back to the campsite, were about to sleep on the grass in fucking freezing conditions (in the mountains) when a swiss couple simply offered their spare tent to us for the night! excellent. SATURDAY: went into town to buy a tent, ended up buy a kiddy tent which was a square metre to put our shit in plus a few lilos to sleep out in the open again, but me and piche ended up BOTH sleeping in the kiddy tent.... with lilos.... and a white sheet ... my legs are still cramping. Saturda was cool, saw GOLDFRAPP who were pretty great, I'm not a huge fan but still loved it, Then saw LIVE, I gotta sa I was very curius considering I used to be obsessed, and they fucking rocked! Possibly one of the best acts at the fest, and the crowd went crazy for em. After that.... COLDPLAY, words cannot describe how incredible this show was, I've never seen anything like it, like 100,000 people in awe, Chris Martin even sang a few lines in German, and the lighting in ellow, even tho I hate the song I couldn't fucking move it was amazing. Highlight: Got pretty wasted during the day but obviously not as much as Marnie who, we discovered, scored herself a tent that night... with a hot beef injection German.... he he he oh also me and Piche in the tent having to listen to a Random running around the site screaming 'ROCK n ROLL!!!' in a German accent all night as I dreamed of having an animal tranquiliser gun to shoot him down SUNDAY: the greatest day of all. Kicked off with the Datsuns who were crazy cool, Nothing as refreshing as genuine Rock n Roll, which is just what I was thinking when I leaned over to Panda and said 'Wouldn't it be hilarious if that random guy shouted out 'ROCK n ROLL' right now, 2 seconds later that exactly what happened! I almost pissed my pants. Cruised around a bit after that, saw SKIN do a little bit, that was cool, was frantically searching for Janelle cos I didn't know if she was coming then I spotted her backstage with INterpol just before they went on so we had a bit of a chat which was cool, but unfortunately no access backstage, meanwhile..... INTERPOL were fucking brilliant, I seriousl think that if i had to design every aspect of a band they would fill every category, the clothes, the hair, the good loks the colour co-ordination (Noni, you a fan yet?) and of course that brilliant, mouth-watering music...ahhhhh Then straight after went crazy with about 20 sweaty Germ gus in the moshpit for Supergrass, outta control... then kicked back on the grass to watch MASSIVE ATTACK clse the festival So all in all it was brilliant, sorr about all the ranting and raving but it had to be done.

I'M IN PRAGUE. Thats right I'm here with all the kids: Panda, Tiff, Piche, Tren, Sarah, Nicky, Stan, Pete, Dave and .... No-Fuck and Pam Well I gotta say its pretty fun. Highlights so far: DAY 1: somehow I wake at 7am after getting 45mins sleep for my last night in Berlin, I make it to Zoo Station by 8, catch a train for 5 hours to Frankfurt Main, then catch a train to Frankfurt Airport jump on a plane to Prague, jump in a \ufffdtaxi, hand the guy a piece of paper with almost incoherent scribble of obscure address on it and he somehow gets me to the dorm (which by the way is so disgusting, communal showers with no curtains... its fully big bro) DAY 2: Getting drunk at the Quadrenale exhibition, or should I say Stan (for those who dont know, Stan is our Santa-esque, jolly, czech workshop teacher from WAAPA/tourguide for Prague), Richard Roberts (designer and head of design @ VCA) and Petey got ABSOLUTELY SMASHED on some wierd rocketfuel. So Pete is stumbling around trying to catch up to us at the tram stop, when I threaten to msg Large and tell him that Pete is a worse drunk than Big Head, Pete goes mental and starts chasing me around the Quad, then gets on the tram, white as a ghost, head held up by Mother Te-reena, and HOSE-VOMITTING outta the tram window!! th\ufffdn we went to a posh restaurant to meet these posh people and Pete just runs to a near by bin and HOSE VOMS again only to be impersonated by some crazy czech guy standing next to him pretending to vomit... hilarious. For those who know Pete its pretty funny to imagine Trenna literally carrying him all he way home, getting abused by people and even having a bucket of water thrown at them....oh poor Tren... ah funny times in ol' Prague. Anyway, more fun times ahead so stay tuned.....

When he'd finished telling me cool tour stories, like rolling a joint for Russell Crow, I asked him if she was any good. I found his response intruiging. It was intruiging because he said \"yes\". Apparently her singing was great, she engaged the audience, the band were cool and the show was a killer. So if she can cut it good on her live tours why is she so phenomenally bad on TV? Rove was atrocious and Fox RoofTop not much better. Her interviews were abysmal and she came off sounding like an extra from Degrassi Junior High that had forgotten all her lines. Monosyllabic thy name is Avril. And the singing... She sounded like your little sister trying to impersonate Avril Lavigne earnestly into a hairbrush. Do the camera's intimidate her? Does she just not care about TVor the media? I'd be carefull about that last one because the media created her and could just as easily take her down. Also everyone has to some how track down a tape of the hilarious documentry \"BoyzVoiced\". One fictional norwegian Boy Bands answer to Spinal Tap. It is absolutely hilarious. Especially when band management discover that BoyZone's sales went up 30% when one of the members came out of the closet. So they \"out\" one of their own members despite him being straight.

Come bed time eat some rhohypnol but, make sure you set your alarm for 6am at maximum volume, don't forget to preset your morning line of speed for the next day. Repeat as required.

It is a beautiful day...blue sky, sunny with white fluffly clouds, green fields and grasshoppers everywhere. We are cruising along about a mile and half from my house--halfway home, Byonce just comes on my headphones and is telling me about her crazy love, when out of NOWHERE comes this vicious little brown poodle thing. I look back for a second before it attacks and all I see are teeth and fur. (Like FIZGIG from The Dark Crystal) Before I know it, I'm on the road with dirt in my mouth. I get up quickly and turn to see my dog, still on his leash, still attached to my headphone holder belt, with the poodle in his mouth, shaking it from side to side like dogs do when you are playing with a rope or an old sock. I grab his collar and scream, \"Drop it!\" He does, the good boy, and the poodle dog is on her back. I see a red squirt of blood come out of her side as she lays there and whines like a bird. Then she gets up and crosses the road going back to the house from which she ran. She lays on her back with all four legs in the air. I'm thinking, \"Oh my God, she's dead already.\" It is then that I realize I still have my headphones on, Byonce is still crazy in love, and I'm bleeding. I have a cut on my middle finger that is dripping red, my shoulder and leg have road rash and bleeding. Strangely, it made me feel young again. Don't get me wrong, I'm no masochist, but sometimes it feels good to get hurt. It makes me feel more alive somehow. And there's nothing like a skinned knee to return you to your childhood. So, an old man comes out from the house. I tell him what happened and apoligized. He said it wasn't my fault and \"you just can't train a dog not to do that.\" He picks up the dog and takes it somewhere behind the house. I walk the dog back to the house and we wait in the driveway. An old lady comes out of the house. Despite the fact that I am visibly injured, she does not ask if I'm okay. I tell her what happened and she's only concerned with where her husband went. He comes around the house a moment later with the wet dog looking like a mexican sewer rat and says that he thinks she's going to be okay. I apologize again and continue my run home. My blood was dark and dried by the time I reached home, and my scratches were stinging from the sweat. I've recovered, however. My scratches are almost gone, but now have dark bruising underneath them. And my finger is almost healed as well.

Haven't danced with so much disdain for my personal reputation for a very long time. I think we also invented a new concept that night in the club - Remote DJ-ing. It's this ritual wherein you keep requesting songs that are better than the ones the DJ was going to play himself. Except you do it by a system of note passing and you give the DJ so much love in return that he actually thinks he chose the songs himself. I think we completely programmed the music from 2am onwards from the dancefloor! Ratcat still rool Ok!

Next, I'm profiling bloggers as there seems to be some confusion flying back and forth accross the land as to who the hell people are talkin to anyhow: Perthonalities: Shayne: I met Shayne in the early months of 2002 when he was a shit-kicker Stage Management Freshman on some crap-ass WAAPA show I was on, and the friendship really only started happening this year when this sudden clan o' Waapa crew became set in concrete. He has an extensive knowledge of films (every aspect of them) and mind altering substnces (again, every aspect of them) plus he's an all round intelligent, funny and tops bloke. NoniDiva: (Diva) hmmmmm what can I say, I spend almost every spare second with this girl, well every spare second that she has, as my life currently resembles the abode of vacancy. She famous before her time, does a killer Liza impersonation, is obsessed with Judy Garland and all things MT (music theatre), you'd think being a performer she'd be a little wary of what she does to her body, in fact she's my ultimate chain smoking, weed puffin, death bag drinkin buddy. Hannah: (Spannah, Etho, Han) We've been thru think and thin, at least as thin as Neil's wet look lycra, being in the same design class for three years and now she has to put up with me loitering around her floral design studio Melbournians: Andrew: (Furze, Emmanual's lover) I met Furze when I was approx. 11 years old when he was my Bro's best friend, for a few years after that I only ever really saw him when he was wearing a red Coles tie or with guitar strapped around him in the music delight that was Girl Friday, you might have spotted him on such TV/Video appearances as Rove (doing drunken miming) GMA (although I didn't see it but I'm assuming more drunken miming), crawling on the sand porn-style in a GF clip and soon to be spotted on the television wonderland of W.A Telethon.... can't wait! (\" I'll donate $20 if Emmanual's guitarist....\") Kate: (Katherine, Katie G, Gardiner, Gards, Sula) The girl I spent every single day with from Grade 4 to Year 12, tops chick, excellent music appreciation, crazy lingo which we've co-developed over the years to the point where saying 'yo' or 'y'all' at the end of every sentance goes unnoticed Lauren (Laurie D, DDDude, Loz, Mama Laurie, Hoochie Laurie, Trudy) Still officially the funniest person I have every met, with an unhealthy obsession, not even obsession, 'lifestyle' of the Simpsons and Seinfeld. She and I met in Year 8 I believe, altho we met a few times before, oh yes, at the footy ground when our bros played together and Loz wore a frog-green tracky every week.... ah d d dude Prue: (Prudence, Tehan) Yes another young lass from St Mary's primary school, in Grade 4 when we played b'ball with the Spectettes (hence the DJ name) other sporting escapades with Tehan involve being two of the 3 girls on the footy team... I'll never forget that goal girl, you're a star.... Guy: (Yug.... hmmm gots to get you more nicknames) Even tho it seems he has disowned us, or just silently reading along in the comfort of his Indian brothel bedroom. Met Guy in the latter half of 2000, at least officially, before then we both tried to act too cool for each other. For any pop-diva enquiries refer to this oracle of knowledge as they take up at least 80% of his rediculously large collection. For his witty bitter scrawlings on celebrities, novels from the turn of the century and possibly how many weaves Marcia can wear refer to Sympsosiasts. International stars: Anna: (Banana, Anner, Nanna) I met Anna over a beer anda scream-along to Bon Jovi's Livin on a Prayer in 2000 when she was on exchange from America. You might have seen her at such Aussie appearances as my bro's 21st in Melb, dancing in the old cage podiums in Connections Nightclub, or busting Tai-Bo moves in Unit 39 Student Housing.

DJ Spectette - Ok, unrealistic I know...but it would be very amusing for interstate visitors and parents!

To her credit she didn't call security on me and even smiled. ohhh...

I even signed an autograph. ha! losers... - Seated on my table was a mixed bag, Peter Hellier, Dave Hughes, Andrew Denton, Neighbours boy and the transexual from \"Idol\" - Grinspoon were on the table next to us and I can confirm that they are all complete dickheads. - No wonder everybody gets drunk the frickin ceremony is over 5 hours long! I can assure you that if it wasn't for the fact that I swapped tables and had dinner with powderfinger I might have been bored. - Everyone was dressed so boringly! What happened to all the great outrageous rock ARIA costumes of the past? I did my bit with a stupid hat and a purple pinstripe suit but it was not enough to stem the tide. - The after-party was the biggest monstrosity of drugs and alcohol, massively consumed by the one industry that knows how to partay harder then the rest. In other words it F%^cking rocked. Random celebrity spottings and pashes. Debauched conversations, loose-lipped gossip, shagging in inappropriate places, excessive cocaine use by everyone - it had it all. This wound up at 6am but the party, like a heaving, living beast, simply picked itself up and relocated itself in the hotel bar where virtually everyone (including myself) was staying.

I don't really know how this movie was ever actually gonna be the hot (as in dripping with sexy goodness) movie it is marketed as. With the tag line of \"LEAVE YOUR INHIBITIONS AT THE DOOR\" I would also recommend leaving your libido, desire to be compelled and your gag reflex also. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of waking up and realizing that you are still drunk, it's awful but kinda entertaining in the right company. For Maximum viewing pleasure watch with: Cheap Beer and Noni 2. Re-Animator Now this is B grade horror in all it's glory. Here we have the story of Herbert West, a disturbing and obsessive mad scientist who creates a serum that brings the dead back to life. Only (like you didn't already know) when the re-agent is applied, the recipients are ressurrected as mad souless zombies. So why is this on this list I hear some of you ask? Mostly because of the acting. It's is so woefully bad as to be wonderful. It also has a scene where a bloody,dismembered head goes down on girl who is strapped to an autopsy table. Terrific stuff!! Add to this an awesome score that is totally derivative of everything Elmer Bernstein ever did for Alfred Hitchcock, so if for nothing else it's cool for its classic hollywood musical cliches megamix. This is the genre film equivalent of sitting next to someone who has just bitten into a KFC drumstick and burst some kind of pus ridden abcess. It's distgusting but you take a guilty form of pleasure that it happened to them and not you. 3. STARSHIP TROOPERS Okay, this movie sucks... period... but there is something absolutely special about seeing ex-calvin klein models come b-string actors getting their faces blown off in high gloss ultra violence. Also this movie stars Doogie Howser as a member of some kind of futuristic gestapo. PRICELESS!! As an intersting sidenote this film is also directed by Paul Verhoeven who is the genius?? who bought us SHOWGIRLS. This is the sunday afternoon equivalent of poking a stick at road kill, it's gross and you feel a little ashamed for enjoying it 4. STUFF Okay, this movie is about evil Yoghurt. That's right yoghurt. You eat the yoghurt and it kills you from the inside. This is one of those special kind of concept movies that could only have been made in the eighties. It has all the hall marks of a great horror movie, including ominous shots of yoghurt tubs half obscured by shadows. There is no one that you would have ever heard of in this movie, in fact none of them probably ever worked again. The Stuff is the star.

They live in an authentic feeling orwellian dystopia where people are forbidden to feel. To achieve this end all art and culture are outlawed and the population is kept emotionally sedated with regular doses of drugs. It is their job to destroy art and those who appreciate it.

Sometimes there's an animated discussion going on (like wether or not I should get breasts) and sometimes people just got nothin and the blogg takes a little breather for a couple of weeks while we recharge our wits. I think bloggy blogg just had such a breather and I for one am ready to once again start throwing shit against it's bloggy walls and seeing what sticks. As for not posting much lately I'm gonna plead the old \"been on tour with fabulously sexy popstar\" chestnut as a form of defence yer honour. Now I'm sitting squarely on my arse in front of the computer and I've got nothing to hide behind.

I can't go into as much depth as I'd like because I suspect that there are people on the tour who have discovered this blogg (I feel so strangely naked). What I can say is that we as an act fully expected to get completely shafted by a big, American touring machine. We expected 5 minute soundchecks, rude/unhelpful road crew, aloof/disinterested backing band and a diva star none of us expected to even meet. I am so pleased to say that nothing could be further from the truth. Everyone on the tour, from the stage manager to Christina's nearest and dearest, were exceptionally nice to us and made the whole experience extraordinarily pleasant. I could rave here for pages about her unbelievably talented band who hung out with us all tour and shared their experience and weed with us most generously, but I won't. Tour highlights for me included; - Performing in front of 15,000 screaming teenage girls, resulting in ultimate rock moment of nearly having to ask girls backstage for ID. Dangerous... - Sucking down bottles of fabulously expensive wine in a spa on a fabulous rooftop condo - The sheer inimaginable delight of having someone else haul all your gear round the country and set it up for you. Orgasmic. - Genital origami displays from our keyboardist (designed purely to shock our poor tour manager), the windsurfer is quite a feat... - My birthday in brisbane, huge hazy night. - Whirlwind tour romance with Cindy the massuese. Erin if you laugh at her name again you die. - The end-of-tour-partay with Ezla, Diva and Christina in attendance. I was so wrapped I could share that night with you, but I fear that you girls and free cocktails are a potent force that should not be repeated too often. - Being intimidated off dancefloors in clubs around the country by Christina's fabulous booty-dancers. - Being told by xtina's ultra-camp stylist that \"for an aussie, you have style\" - Being so wasted you forget which city you are in (Brisbane for the record). - Being busted leaving the Park Hyatt at 7am by laughing personal xtina security - Being busted by the cops in Adelaide doing 51kmph in a \"temporary\" 40kmph zone.

Be prepared to find something in your bed whenever you arrive home, semi-conscious, surrounded by a moat of chocolate and hj's wrappers and moaning for a cigarette! (I hope you realize i'm talking about Buntine and not me!). Maybe at this pump pad I will actually pump, rather than be pumped (and i'm not reffering to getting laid, as everyone already knows), what i mean by pumped is continuously mounted and dry rooted by whoever hasn't seen their girlfriend/boyfriend in a whole day!! (ie Tom, Leon, Erin etc etc). Anyway, i'm quite excited about moving, i just need to make a shitload of money some how...and no Erin, i'm not going into prostitution, even if it does mean i get laid! So if any Melbournites know of any jobs coming up around feb...please post! Hi Noni........! I miss you xxxxoxoxoxoxoxoxox Time to go, love to all esp. poodle\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "OK the circus kicks off in Sydney tomorrow so tune in for the \"Christina tour diary\" over the next 2 weeks.

I know there is a tendancy to rave on about great gigs you saw butI'd like to think I am a little bit more reserved with my praise, but make no mistake this was the BEST F%$#ing gig ever. Playing with confidence of a band completely on top of their game, muse let the music do all the talking. The most stunning thing about this band is the unelievably huge sound that this three-piece band generate, without backing tapes or nuttin! Tickets for this gig sold out in 20 min, so an incredibly knowledgable crowd virtually salivated over a flawless, stellar performance. Post gig is a bit of a blur but it involves drinking expensive champers in a very expensive hotel room with some very good friends and passing out at 4am. So know at my brand new desk at my brand new office job (I know , me!??) trying very hard to keep it all together in front of 30 new colleagues.

A golden insight into what actually goes on at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and who these people actually are! Ok, Firsty HFPA have been dishin out Golden Globes for like 56 years or something, so you'd think that there must be some cred behind these unknown-to- non -celebrities faces.... turns out there are only 96 members, of whom only a third are actually currently contributing to the press in some form ... and most of that 1/3 are for unknown (to Hollywood) Czech or Greek newspapers. This means that 96 people (almost none of whom are actual film critics or know anything about film) are getting together and telling the rest of the world what the best films, actors and t.v programs of the year are, usually just after they've been wined and dined by the publicists and producers of these productions. The funniest thing about it is that when the HFPA was founded all those years ago, the idiots made it a non profit organisation, thus explaining why most of the members look like distant relatives of Fran Drescher , are usually the most excited people in the room at all celeb functions and have to run a business like a B on the side to survive. The only thing they get for free is getting flown to Film Festivals where 'they get treated extremely well in very expensive hotels for a week then fly back to L.A and catch the bus home'. In fact the best quote is (can't remember who said this, probably some bitter producer or journalist) \"I think the reason why the Golden Globes is a good story is because its a great comedy.... about small people with huge aspirations, who somehow almost seem to have these aspirations realised. Its a great comedy about big organisations looking at small people thinking we can put them to use. Its a great story about how media culture will take all of that and turn it into something huge and that in fact will then have world wide implications... and yet at the centre of it, it means nothing\" Its incredibly amusing that everybody in Hollywood jokes about the Golden Globes and yet it gets larger every year and people kinda want one anyway even if they have to have their photo taken with every single individual of the HFPA (that's 96 different photos with pseudo cast members of The Nanny).

I've decided that there is absolutely nothing better in the world than to sit and hear nothing. Not traffic, not conversation, not even music.

Having never been physically shaken by a film, I sit here nearly an hour later with jittery fingers and a lingering sickness in the pit of my stomach. I can't help but wonder if this is the same reaction that the audience and viewers of shunned art of the past had. To quote the film 'Basquiat', \"Nobody wants to be part of a generation who ignores another Van Gogh... you better pay attention, you might be staring at [his] ear\".... with this in mind its quite comforting to know that most of the time, the artists and 'intellectuals' of this world are constantly looking out for each other by appearing to fully understand their work and immediately crowning it as a 'masterpiece'. Without having read any reviews about Dogville nor having known anything about it before I went in, I have no doubt that this is what a lot of critics would have done. Personally I think this film is a pile of over-crammed horseshit tightly packed into a minimalist 'theatre' (oh so credible) set, with an emphasis on often conflicting theories of humanity. Now the amount of spelling/grammar mistakes in this paragraph alone probably points out that I'm not smart enough or 'in touch with humanity' to understand/appreciate this film, and I may very well have been staring at Van Gogh's ear, but I am unashamed to admit this and I only wish that all who were involved in the production of this film would have the good humour to do the same.

But if I changed my name to Bucket tomorrow, the fact that noone has ever known me has bucket would have wide-ranging implications.

Then again, I'm going overseas so i need some cash. \"Bucket\" it is for $2000 in a paper bag. 2) Time travel to any significant event in history? It would have to be either a) the assasination of julius ceasar, b) the fall of Robespierre and the french revolution or c) Hendrix at Woodstock 3) 5 CD's to take back to the birthplace of civilisation - 1) Gustav Holst - The Planets Suites - 2) Led Zeppelin IV - 3) Louis Armstrong - Greatest Hits - 4) The Beatles - Rubber Soul - 5) Electric 6 - Fire 4) TV show resurrection?

It's a new aussie flick starring whats-his-face from \"secret lice of puss\" (surprisingly I don't mean samuel johnson). It's a look at one young classical composer's entry into rave culture via his departed OD'ing sister. Very hip, very now, very 1998. Now with the likes of Shayne blogging on this here bloggy blog I am very reluctant to attempt any sort of cinematic deconstruction. However the concensus was that for a film that profers to \"break all the rules\", the only rules it seemed to break were those of logical, well-paced script writing and editing. But what really sticks out about this movie is the exploration of a melbourne rave scene that doesn't really exist, or at least hasn't for quite a while. Melbourne is in the grips of what could only be described as a rock revolution (Melbourne venues are now scampering to put bands back ON the stage) and in 2004 here comes this movie to the cinemas like a mature-age student to a keg party in happy pants. I couldn't help thinking \"Guy's Melbs hasn't had a full-time rave scene since the summer of cargos, boobtubes and the first delirium album. Did someone forget to mention that ROCK IS BACK!!\" Mind you, they probably conceived this movie in 1997 and knowing the australian film industry it took them seven years to get it off the ground. It just seemed unfortunetly irrelevant. Still most amazing of all was the fact that spanda, ezla and myself were so tired we turned down a free-booze after-party .

Now, I know that I've already blogged months ago about how amazing it is, but that was only after a couple of listens. You know when you have records in your collection that you think you've had a good listen to and you know you love em but they've kinda been in the background..... then suddenly one day it just seems to make sense that you absolutely adore this album. Well, this week, Room On Fire has been locked in as one of my favourite albums of all time. I think I've finally come to understand this intense connection with it which stems directly from my soul and makes me long to listen to it again and again. Its the kind of record that can't be thought of in terms of individual songs but as an entire body of work, and this body is so drenched with a kind of beautiful, untouchable melancholy which has arisen from a life that promises everything and nothing. Seeing Julian's behaviour in a room full of people who would love nothing more than to talk/fuck/be around him for as long as possible, it saddened me to realise that I've never seen somebody look so desperately lonely, one thing's for sure, there's no mystery surrounding the title of the album anymore. I dunno, I guess I can't explain it, but Room on Fire seems to sum up my life at the moment. Trademark Strokes rhythms: a soundtrack to some relentless party, smothered with Julian's heavy, slow and romantic drawl over the top tapping into a beautiful sadness that each and every one of us cherishes and holds close to our hearts.

It's almost certain he meant to rip something, but was he a little too eager? 2. Was her tit meant to reveal itself to an international audience of millions? Is Janet Jackson's career in that much trouble that she had to resort to busting out the boobies? Will this set a trend at future events in a post maddonna-brittany world?

Everyone should blogg like him - as if no one is reading it. But easier said than done. Also for the Apex of blogging look no further than \"Belle De Jour\" (a google search will lead you there). Unbelievably well written blogg from the diaries of a london call girl. This girl has inspired a massive following, as well as a trans-atlantic search to unmask her identity. Last month she secured all bloggers holy grail - a six-figuure book deal. A must read. And now to completely contradict the tone of the aforementioned bloggs and return you to the normal levels of decency and depth as expected on this here NW of bloggs.

The Back Page By Steve Martin STUDIO SCRIPT NOTES ON \"THE PASSION\" Dear Mel, We love, love the script! The ending works great. You'll be getting a call from use to start negotiations for the book rights. -- Love the Jesus character. So likable. He can't seem to catch a break! We identify with him because of it. One thing: I think we need to clearly state \"the rules.\" Why doesn't he use his superpowers to save himself? Our creative people suggest that you could simply cut away to two spectators: SPECTATOR ONE Why doesn't he use his superpowers to save himself? SPECTATOR TWO He can only use his powers to help others, never himself. -- Does it matter which garden? Gethsemane is hard to say, and Eden is a much more recognizable garden. Just thinking out loud. -- Our creative people suggest a clock visual fading in and out in certain scenes, like the Last Supper bit: \"Thursday, 7:43 p.m.,\" or \"Good Friday, 5:14 p.m.\" -- Love the repetition of \"Is it I?\" Could be very funny. On the eighth inquiry, could Jesus just give a little look of exasperation into the camera? Breaks frame, but could be a riot. -- Also, could he change water into wine in Last Supper scene? Would be a great moment, and it's legit. History compression is a movie tradition and could really brighten up the scene. Great trailer moment, too. -- Love the flaying. -- Could the rabbis be Hispanic? There's lots of hot Latino actors now, could give us a little zing at the box office. Research says there's some historical justification for it. -- Possible title change: \"Lethal Passion .\" Kinda works. The more I say it out loud, the more I like it. -- Is there someplace where Jesus could be using an iBook? You know, now that I say it, it sounds ridiculous. Strike that. But think about it. Maybe we start a shot in Heaven with Jesus thoughtfully closing the top? -- Love the idea of Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene (yow!). Our creative people suggest a name change to Heather. Could skew our audience a little younger. -- Love Judas. Such a great villain. Our creative people suggest that he's a little complicated. Couldn't he be one thing? Just bad? Gives the movie much more of a motor. Also, thirty pieces of silver is not going to get anyone excited. I think it'd be very simple to make him a \"new millionaire.\" Bring in the cash on a tray. Great dilemma that the audience can identify with. -- Minor spelling error: on page 18, in the description of the bystanders, there should be a space between the words \"Jew\" and \"boy\". -- Merchandising issue: it seems the Cross image had been done to death and is public domain -- we can't own it. Could the Crucifixion scene involve something else? A Toyota would be wrong, but maybe there's a shape we can copyright, like a wagon wheel? -- I'm assuming \"The dialogue is in Aramaic\" is a typo for \"American\". If not, call me on my cell, or I'm at home all weekend. By the way, I'm sending a group of staffers on a cruise to the North Pole, coincidentally around the time of your picture's release.

At around the 70 pot mark, the oldies at the RSL crank up the karaoke machine......oh man it was all down hill from there, especially after we found out they were giving away hampers of alcohol to any old participant.

The good news is that the lead players in the music industry have all fucked up to the tune of millions of dollars and still managed to hang in there and thrive. Some shitty melbourne band booker trying to save his own arse and blasting you in the process don't mean nuthin. He's probably more pissed off at himself for not doing his job properly. Also, store his name in your memory. One day he'll come crawling to you for a favour and you'll be able to deal with him in kind. Some call it Karma, it certainly all goes around and comes around. I'm pretty much known for my dire forecasts and diagnosis of the music industry, but if anyone here takes more than a passing interest in the mechanics of the beast take heart from the charts this week. John Butler Trio is a shining and prominent example of how you need not work within the old, outdated framework of the industry establishment in order to achieve sucess and have a fruitful and artistically rewarding career. JBTrio funded their first album and have funded their own recordings ever since, which they put out through an independant distributor. This means that, not only do they have no label to answer to commercially or atristically, but they personally pocket $10 from every album sold (Compared to the $1.70 industry average). The major way they market their music is by extensive touring, which they profit greatly from anyway. They keep their overheads low and don't spend money unneccisarily on mainstream advertising and marketing campaigns. They built up the reputation and popularity of their act over several years, having then patience not to ever try and hype their way into everyone's conciesness. Their label mates, \"The Waifs\" have followed a similar career path, with fans all over the globe and very profitable concert tours. This week John Butler Trio debuted #1 on the Australian Charts with their new album \"Sunrise Over Sea\", selling a massive 25,000 units in only it's first week of release. This is an amazing achievement for an independant act and a level of success and profitability that Australia's major labels can only dream and hopefully aspire to. In reality the success of JBT should be a massive fucking wake-up call to the majors. It should spell out that the days of signing some act just because everyone else wants it, while having no vision for the act nor any idea of how to develop it other than to throw huge bundles of cash around and hope that something sticks are over. That spending more on marketing and the paychecks for outdated, dinosaur execs than on development is stupid. That signing acts that will do well with 14 year old girls for about a month before dissapearing is short-sighted and ultimately unprofitable. That signing acts that simply ape what was popular six months ago is not progressive, imaginative or very smart. That the internet was the most exciting music delivery system to emerge in 1996 and that being eight years behind such a crucial technology and failing to see it's potential is unforgiveable and incredibly fucking incompetent. That bitching, whining and sueing fans now that the downloading horse has bolted is pointless. That telecommunications companies are acting more efficiently as record companies with their ringtones then the actual companies are. That their days are numbered and and unless they repent and change they will eventually dissapear to be replaced by a system that is more efficient and kinder to artists and fans.

I was inspired to to do this after I blew the dust off my copy of The Cure's 'Pornography' last night and gave it a spin. Man oh man did the memories come flooding back. To those unfamiliar with The Cure's work other than their sugary fun hits like 'Friday I'm In Love' , 'High', 'Lovecats', 'Just Like Heaven' etc I imagine them to be portrayed as a slightly wierd yet ultimately superficial band with some fat dude up the front with big hair and make up. But what never ceases to amaze me and the main reason why I love the band so much is the vast scope of emotion they've poured into all their songs over the past 25 years. Ok, granted the Cure's lineup has basically changed every 2 years which will account for the amount of variety in their music, but good ol' fat Bob keeps on rockin and I have no idea how he survived writting this album. 'Pornography' has often been voted 'the darkest' or 'most depressing' album of all time by the likes of NME, Rolling Stone etc. But the words 'dark' and 'depressing' don't even begin to describe how horribly heart breaking this album really is. It was actually quite firghtening to realise that these songs were once so much a part of my life that they were basically my soundtrack. Every track swirls and washes into another with a deep grief, the lyrics bring up images of black haired girls, hanging gardens, black flags, and who can forget : 'A hundred years of blood, crimson, the ribbon tightens round my throat, i open my mouth, and my head bursts open, a sound like a tiger thrashing in the water, trashing in the water' . It was actually rumoured to have been written about the suicide of Joy Division's Ian Curtis a year before its relaese in 1982. What makes me most uncomfrtable about listening to this si the fact that Robert Smith actually lived on to write such stupidly happy songs like 'Lovecats' and 'Mintcar', at least when you listen to Joy Division , you pretty much know what you're gonna get, this might sound wierd, but the fact that Ian Curtis died brings some kind of sick comfort. 'Pornography' is just disturbing. Admittedly yes, I do suffer from manic depression (like every other fucker on earth) and this album might not be for everyone, but its definitely worth a listen. I'll leave you with the lyrics to my favourite Cure song ever, track 4 on Pornography..... SIAMESE TWINS I chose an eternity of this Like falling angels The world disappeared Laughing into the fire Is it always like this? Flesh and blood and the first kiss The first colours The first kiss We writhed under a red light Voodoo smile Siamese twins A girl at the window looks at me for an hour Then everything falls apart Broken inside me It falls apart The walls and the ceiling move in time Push a blade into my hands Slowly up the stairs And into the room Is it always like this? Dancing in my pocket Worms eat my skin She glows and grows With arms outstretched Her legs around me... In the morning I cried Leave me to die You won't remember my voice I walked away and grew old You never talk We never smile I scream You're nothing I don't need you any more You're nothing It fades and spins Fades and spins... Sing out loud We all die!!! Laughing into the fire... Is it always like this?\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Don't think I can wait 2 months to see the \"Hot Property\" tape. Too funny.

New York is the best city on earth New York is not that bad - I don't know if it's a post 9-11 thing or what, but new york is not nearly as intense, rude, crime-ridden, or nasty as everyone says. People are generally polite, if brisk. The service is never too bad (hey do they want the tip?), the weather at the moment pleasant and the taxi's generally B.O free. And this isn't rose coloured glasses either, i've been looking for the worst and just not really finding it. New york is easy to get around, the subway is clean, cheap, safe and efficient. the cabs are unbelievably cheap, it's virtually impossible to run up a fare past $8 in manhattan. The bouncers at the clubs have been cool, the cops on the street jovial and the little dogs that ridiculously dressed women on 5th Avenue walk seem to yap not too much. Brooklyn is becoming safe and a little gentrified. The village is becoming a bohemian fashion capital. Oh my, the village (my future place of residence). Full to the brim of record stores that have savaged my credit card to the point where I may have to return home several months early. Full of obscure anonymous bars where bands of every genre occupy the floorspace of a phone booth and play nightly, full of colour, culture, history and attitude. I am moving here without a doubt, just find me a place in manhattan for less than $400 a week... Every single person on the island of manhattan own an Ipod. Period. New York has 130 people in it. The lonely planet will try and fool you into believing that 8 million people co-exist in this thriving metropolis but it's complete bullshit. I've made same amazing friends here who I've met in completely different circumstances in unrelated places and they all FRICKIN KNOW EACH OTHER! over and over again. This point was undelicately illistrated to me on monday night. Me and Benno attended the launch of a new Tommy fragrance (try if you will to imagine me and Benno on the red carpet with the photographers snapping like crazy, behind Maris Tomai and the cast of \"queer eye\"). I was kind of hooked up with Jesse Malin's keyboard player who was playing the party. Across the room I spotted an MTV presenter I had kind of hooked up with several nights previous in a bar on the other side of town and had been in contact with since (friend of Carlos' for the benifit of Ez) . Sure enough to my horror they have mutual friends and in about 4 seconds I'm in a pile of shit. Benno later ends up having conversation with MTV's ex-boyfriend in completely unrelated bar while going home that night with Ryan Adams ex-girlfriend (quote: \"I've been where ryan's been...\"). Jesse Malin was a really great guy by the way and went out of his way to get us into the gig. Sorry Ez, but Mr C is a complete animal. Half the women I've met are connected in that they were once with you-know-who, even one girl from London and another from Germany. 8 million people on this island and I meet random people who are all connected. I guess it's because everyone over the age of 24 on this island has some fabulous job, costume designer for Law and order, MTV presenter, (successful) musician, (successful) models, (successful) artists and, dare I say it, (successful) actors. No wannabe's like LA, just people doing their thing, and well. And you'll never get out of them what they do either. Big note-ing, networking, name dropping and bullshit are all things they do in that plastic fairy-tale known as L.A. In NY people are busy getting on with the business of doing it for real. And no one cares that you are from Australia. New Yorker's to a man loathe Bush, and I love them for it. So much more to say but I'm completely out of time. Off to Carlos' birthday party tonight.

I felt like I was watching the Brownlow. d) The Sound and Camera work was appalling, most of the live acts' mics only kicked in 1 minute into the song, as if they were doing a soundcheck as they went. * Guy and Shannon's performance reminded me of the P.A.F or some kind of Rock Estedford. * Yeah, the whole Delta (or Deltra, as Eddie would say, and did say, 3 times) Cancer thing. I can't believe they did it again. After being appalled at the on stage 'conversations' she was forced to have at the ARIAS, I cannot believe, Eddie went out of his way three times to mention it and ask her how she was going. The look on her face said nothing but \"Yes, fuckwit I have cancer, I know it, You know it, everyone here knows it, let's get on with it\" * Very impressed with the CNNNN win. Can't believe TV week buyers voted for them but fuckin good on em. * Elanor, just read your blog about Rove's acceptance speech. I think all he was saying, and I agree with, is that the Logies really are important to have in Australia. I mean Rove knows they're a pile of shit, and must be pretty boring sitting at that table just drinkin away, and that oddly, there suddenly seemed to be a lot of people reading TV week around the office at Channel Ten in the months prior. But really, what else do we have? Australian television is something that should be nurtured, congratulated and celebrated. Its part of everybody's lives, even if we watch it just to bag it! And with 90% of Australian Actors being unemployed, I think its something that should be encouraged. So yes the Logies are a sham. But we love it. We love seeing Home n Away sluts coked to the eyeballs and falling out of limos. We love violently throwing things at the television when Eddie McGuire comes on. We love cringing at Bert Newton. We love wisecracks about Larry Emder. We love perving on Dicko with his new hair and proclaiming how hot he is...... oh wait. Thats just me. But anyway. I guess I'm just saying I love any kind of awards. They're hilarious for a number of reasons, usually the wrong ones. And I'm tired of comparing them to American or British awards, because you just can't! They're cheap, they're tacky, they're try-hard, but I say embrace them in all their glory!\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Ok Iknow I've gone too far this time, but I have actually created a test about myself, and would be very interested to know how you all go Here's my first question: 1.

Check out the results of my urlLink INK-BLOT test: your subconscious mind is driven most by Sexuality What this means is that when your unconscious mind sees an opportunity to remind you of your sexual desires, it takes full advantage of it. Because of this, things that have very little sexual content or that seem sexually neutral to others, may register as sexually charged to you, at least on an unconscious level. Your unconscious mind recognizes the value of sexuality. The reason it may do so, is because of a deep-rooted fear of the opposite \u2014 living a life that is numb to sexual desire or is turned cold by it. You unconscious mind may be trying to avoid this sexual dullness, and so it reacts by swinging to the opposite extreme, strong sexual desire. By sending you these sexual messages on a regular basis, your unconscious makes sure you don't forget about sex. If you view your sexual desire with a positive attitude, you can welcome the vitality and strength sexual thoughts can bring into your life. This would allow you to honor the drive your unconscious has chosen to be an important focus for you. It is a message that you are very much alive, and have a great deal of passion to bring to life. Though your unconscious mind is driven most strongly by Sexuality, there is much more to who you are at your core.

So saw the Von Bondies last night, and frankly, was kinda disappointed.

When I got there I realised that as always, this hype was generated purely to boost ticket sales, as it obviously wasn't sold out, and I had a spare ticket that I had high hopes of selling out the the front, and ended up not being able to GIVE it away. Don't get me wrong, they were pretty rockin and the performance of 'Rock n Roll Nurse' was one of the most rockin things I've ever seen but there was something lacking. There was no bonding with the audience, they just powered right thru for a measly 1 hour set. I think the only time anything was said was when they were encouraging us to clap along, asking if anyone had been in love, and then doing the oh too common line 'wow, you guys are awesome, you're living up to everythig we've heard about Melbourne, we heard you guys rock!!!! and there's so much talent in this city! blah blah blah......' that aint impressin me anymore, infact its giving me some kind of 'legendry music city' ego, so much so, that bands are really gonna have to put out to impress me. However, there's no way my ego could ever match that of the Von Bondies . I mean yeah its cool to have rockstar 'I'm so cool it hurts' attitude, but for a band who a have around 4 awesome 'party songs' and aint being terribly original the rest of the time, I really think they should lose the toode and stop taking themselves so seriously.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "hey guys 's been a long time between blogs i know.

It could be the fact that im seeing all my greatest pals, my loving fam, and am not working in the fume factory (pet name for the arts centre carpark), but waking up to rays of warm light through my window, after sleeping on a proper bed, and the first thing i see is my little meow meow snuggled up and purring...is the greatest thing in my world! I've also seen some great critters in the 3 days i've been here...dolphins, quokkas, bob tail goannas and seagulls. The seagull is not usually something i would usually class as a \"great critter\", but after the episode on rottnest island, i have to say that i think they're ace! Shayne..i know your currently pissing your pants if ur reading this! Shayne, myself and tiffany decided to take the little runabout boat for a chug around the bay on sunday after trennas wedding. We all piled in with a box of bbq shapes for the ride and proceeded to leisurely boat about on the open sea. I think it was Tiff who thought she would throw a shape to a one legged seagull flying parallel to us(where do all those legs go by the way, and how come so many freakin seagulls have lost one leg in the first place?)sorry about that...i will now continue with the story... But as you can imagine, in true seagull style (you throw a tiny morsel of food and they start flying from antartica), we suddenly had a swarm of sky vermin flying behind us! This caused Tiffany to have about seven coronarys in succession. So Shayne sped up, and to the average boater or person strolling on the shore, we would have looked like three screaming twits flying across the bay dodging boats and bouys (those floating bobble things), with a plague of seagulls chasing us trying to steal our shapes. The fact that the boat only did about 6 km, tiff was screaming like someone had just chopped off her nipple, and the army of seagulls were flying 5cm from our heads all added to the hilarity of the situation. As all those who know me could imagine, i was about to combust! Laughing with such force that i thought all my organs were going to come out of my mouth at once! This is not so great when you are trying desperately not to fall overboard. And it wasnt a short episode....this went on for a good 7 minutes or so till we had driven the entire length of the bay to nearly the edge of the island! Something i will never forget. And this is an example of why i love Perth....cos this random shit could only happen here in this random gigantic state! Hope all is well in melbs, and poodle u are not going crazy just yet. Cant wait for u to get ur ass to the west side...i'm starting to realise that u are actually my \"other half\", as some people like to say. Everyone over here is coupled up, and i just thought...well my partner is getting here on friday, so nnnnneeeerrrr!

Once I started getting heavily into music production I couldn't listen to anything and just enjoy it anymore. Instead of just appreciating the overall song I had to mentally rip it apart piece by piece. Instead of being swept away by some great melody and lyrics I'd sit there wondering what guitar amp they were using and what EQ settings they had on the kick drum - painful! Then maybe I'd heard on the grapevine that the album I was listening to cost too much or had to be remixed or some useless shit and I'd be obessing over that. Then worst of all I'd start listening to bad songs because \"the production was great\" (like avril lavigne - amazing production, annoying artist). Then I'd do this whole ridiculous \"Can't see the forrest for the tree's\" thing where I'd listen less to an artist because they had no obvious marketable value and I knew that it would ultimately fail, even though it was really good music - stupid. For about 2 years I don't think I really appreciated any new acts for my own pure love of them as against my perception of their worth within the industry. uuugghhhh! And then one day about 12 months ago I found a subliminal switch that turned all of that off and I found myself loving acts just for the fricking hell of it and ignoring the industry babble. I'm still partial to ripping apart people's records and analysing production values, but I've also started jumping up and down on my bed again, and playing air guitar - both very good signs that you've forgotten about an act's marketing potential. I think you just learn to trust your own instincts about music and worry about the rest later. That said, I'm so glad that you're throwing yourself into your course.

We have a tent bought at Walmart, an Avis convertible and a whole lotta dreams. Actually we are so underprepared for this it's not funny, but the important thing is we are here. Erin wish you were here right now, seeing as I didn't even know about this festival until you posted about it on da blog so many months ago, didn't dream back then that I'd actually make it. Love the cure dissection and the album reviews by the way. The list that shaped my life is not nearly as cool but here goes anyway (this is not my favourite albums of all time, merely the ones that had the biggest affect on me over the years)... John Farnham - Age of Reason I listened to this cassette so incessantly as a kid that it wore out and mum had to buy me another one. Played it all day, every day on one 5 day car trip top perth, nearly inspiring parental infaticide. Musically doesn't have much to do with me anymore but definetly inspired me to want to perform. Hi-light: johnny's ode to human imperfection \"we're no angels\" Faith No More - The Real Thing Got this album a couple of years later in Grade 6 (on cassette again). One tragic listen and suddenly poor johhny wasn't speaking to me quite the same. Hi-light: \"Mid-life crisis\", mike patton inspiring in me a hard rock crush that took a decade to die. You Am I - Hi Fi Way The album that tought me how to play guitar. Easily one of the best Australian albums of the 90's. Hi-light: \"applecross wing commander\" with an ending that makes me want to smash something, or dance, or run naked through bourke st mall, or maybe just form a band and play gigs. Smashing Pumpkins - Siamese Dream When this album came out it seemed almost too cool for me to own. I have personally bought 6 copies of this album and, thanks to the CD handling abilities of my siblings, am probably destined to buy more. Hi-light: Billy corgan sums up every 15 year old kid's angst in mayonaise - \"No more promise, no more sorrow No longer will I follow Can anybody hear me? I - just - want - to BE ME!\" ahhhhhh Silverchair - Frogstomp. Probably raise a few eyebrows here but let me make it very clear - This album is a fucking great rock record. Most australian bands would severe their collective limbs to be able to write an album as complete and well written as this. Add the fact that they did it all at age 14 out of newcastle in 1995 - amazing. Shat me to tears when critics at the time called them \"nirvana in pyjamas\" when their sound owed everything to detroit-scene hard-rockers like Helmut, and much less to the quiet/loud Nirvana. Hi-light: cheesy lyrics aside \"Israel's son\" is a corker. Honorable mentions: The Beatles - Abbey Road (played till the vinyl melted) Nick Cave - Let love in Ice T - Power (Don't ask) Stone Roses - Self Titled Nirvana - Bleach Cream - Disraeli gears The meanies - 10% Weird Pearl Jam - Vitalogy Violent Femmes - Self titles Smashing Pumpkins - Gish Snout - Circle high and wide Led Zeppelin - II Best of Dire straits Jeff buckley - grace Ani Difranco - Up, up, up etc Once again only a few of these would make my all time top 10 but, as erin said, they made me who I am today.

The Cure 'Pornography' Favourite moment: The chorus of 'The Hanging Garden': 'fall fall fall fall out of the sky, jump jump out of time, fall fall fall fall out of the sky, cover my face as the animals cry' 2. Muse 'Absolution' Favourite moment: The point where Matt breaks into some kind of heightened desperation in the chorus of 'Sing For Absolution'... sing for absoluuuuuuution! I will be singing and falling from your grace 3. Ryan Adams 'Love Is Hell Pt 1' Favourite moment: The entrance of the Cello on 'The Shadowlands' 4. Counting Crows 'Recovering the Satellites' Favourite Moment: Adam's breakdown at the end of 'Miller's Angels' : 'Can't ya hear me? coz I'm screaming. I did not go outside yesterday. Don't wake me please, don't wake me! coz I was dreaming. And I might just stay inside again today. Yknow, I don't go out much these days. Sometimes I stay inside all day. So leave me leave me leave me alone. 5. PJ Harvey 'Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea' Favourite Moment: During the beautiful duet with Thom Yorke, 'This Mess We're In' when they get down to the spoken word bit and I'm pretty sure PJ says 'The sweat on my skin, (orgasmic 'uhhhh') ' I'm still not entirely sure of this lineup, it changes every week anyway.

Unfortunately I missed the first band: Sojourn but made in time for the others: The Pranks: I can see why people love this band, and why they have such a lively and large following. I must say the audience added a great deal to this awesome performance. They had it all: stompin' good rock songs, quirky rocknroll singer with zany attitude and an awesome strong voice, a cool guy rockin out on the Rhodes......... but this business of 'having it all' only makes me think I've seen all this before. I mean sure, they had great songs, the crowd loved it, the singer jumped off the stage and rolled around on the ground.... but isn't that what everybody does? hmm.... maybe I'm being overly critical, and acting like a typical spoilt little melbourne audience... The Roys: In a word: sensational. No! wait! I need more words! It was so refreshing to see people handpicking EXCELLENT influences on their music and turning them into something uniquely their own. This band seriously was one of the best I've seen in a long time. They were like Kings of Leon/Johnny Cash/alternative country/southern rock ... with the vocals and demeanor of Julian Casablancas... and some hilarious facial expressions from the drummer.

The fact that we try to sleep for longer to avoid the day, and is this some non-permanent form of suicide? Avoiding life, sneaking into oblivion in hope that life will pass us by. It reminds me of a confession made by an anonymous English writer in Alfred Alvarez's classic study 'The Savage God': Both my parents, for different reasons, regarded death as the perfect release from their troubles. Like my father, I have always demanded too much of life and people and relationships - far more than exists really. And when I find that it doesn't exist, it seems like a rejection... In the afternoons, my mother and father both retired to sleep. That is, they retired to death. They really died for the afternoons. My father was a parson. He had nothing to do, he had no work. I begin now to understand how it was for him. When I'm not working, I'm capable of sleeping through most of the morning. Then I start taking sleeping pills during the day to keep myself in a state of dopiness so that I can sleep at any time. To take sleeping pills during the day to sleep isn't so far from taking sleeping pills in order to die. It's just a bit more practical and a bit more craven. But during those afternoons I used to be alive and lively. It was a great big house but I never dared make a sound... I felt terribly rejected,... their door was always shut. ... And those afternoons went on a long time. Because of the war I went back to live with them, and it was still exactly the same. If I ever bumped myself off it would be in the afternoon. The reason is simple: when I'm alone, I stop believing I exist. Sorry...... that was really really depressing, it wasn't intentional, just something I'm interested in at the moment. But Poodle, I've come to the conclusion that you can't wait for something to happen, you have to make it happen yourself. Think in terms of a slate: with layers upon layers of projects, thinking about one while you're in the middle of something else, always keep the ball rolling, always keep your mind active and progressive otherwise it will fall numb and give in. It is much more exciting and fulfilling to try and fail than to never leave your pillow. And try at a million things! At a million billion things! even if thy're just a floating fantasy that popped into your head oe day, do something about it, talk to randoms in the street, write it down, tell somebody, get excited.

What it does is similar to the iTrip (iPod) in its wireless connection to a spare frequency on your radio. Allowing you to play digital music files from your computer wirelessly to and iPodish remote to any stereo/speakers in your house to a range of 45m. The same thing will eventually happen with televisions, allowing you to wirelessly watch movies stored on your computer. The cool thing is they only cost around $50! Finally, technology is becoming exciting again. Just like when the cassette-based walkman was invented to revolutionize the music consumption and experience.

I also found it odd that he was playing at Festival Hall , also known as 'Festy Hole', had I been willing to pay $140 for a ticket, I would have been very disappointed. Justin was his usual average kinda self, tryin to talk all black but occasionally slipping back into default white boy accent and sounding like Ed Norton. He was completely overshadowed by his band who were just: SO ....... FUCKING ....... GREAT They were the main reason I wanted to go to the gig. Or the main reason I wanna go and see any of these huge Popstars, because they have the most fucking amazingly talented bands in the world. Especially somebody like Justin, whose music I admired purely for the sounds they were using and all the incredible detail that goes into the music when you really listen to it and ignore his wailing over the top of it. But yeah, thats my cheap thrills for the week, seeing another popstar. Getting all wierded out when girls absolutely screamed a lung out when he took off his shirt (to reveal ....oooooh another shirt). And seeing Cam Diaz watching on from the side and having a bit of a boogie, for some reason my brain is telling me that that's kind of special or something. Anywho, thats that. now I gotta run and do 8000000 assignments before Wed. So expect an even greater amount of procrastination posts in the next 48 hours.

Unrivalled even... as far as recent rock albums go. - Somebody should shoot Rob Mills in the temple, then run at his body with an axe, carving up every bloodied inch of him and then stick them in a blender, then drink the puree of his body and then vomit it all over his new record.

There's all these adorable little scribbled notes in it like: major = happy, minor = sad ; and 'a phrase is a curved line over the notes, it is a musical sentence' . I remember how much I desperately wanted to be good at piano and how much I would punish myself when I wasn't.

I'm not trying to be my usual attention seeking overly dramatic self here but this is seriously what I've always thought, and I think the moment has arrived. I've noticed that especially in the last 12 months I've been drifting further and further away from reality. This used to be because I had nothing to do, and thus nothing to focus on. And that extremely brief stint that I did working full time kind of helped because it gave me some kind of false sense of worth. I convinced myself that by getting up at 5am and mixing paint for Tradies til 6pm I was actually servicing my community, I was actually giving back to the society that had supposedly given me so much. I've since convinced myself that this is a load of shit. Everybody is convinced that working is the right, good and honest thing to do with your life. And if you don't do it then you're a disgrace and a bludger and a brat. The fact that I don't work at the age of 22 is frowned upon by basically every single person I know. The main reason for this I guess, is they see it as me relying on others to get me through life financially, and I should stop being such a spoilt brat and get over it.

I refuse to do that in order to have those simple human rights! .... ... And that brings me back to my point of not being in touch with reality. ...

Just to look back and have a little chuckle over. So here we go, gonna have to do this in point form of the things I remember most clearly: - Day ONE: The Big Day Out, where I met Crackers for the first time. I remember sitting there whilst he Andrew were mumbling something towards each other then suddenly Furze goes \"Gee Erin, you don't like Cocaine do you?\" I reply in mega sarcastic monotone \"No Andrew, Cocaine is not my favourite drug of all time\" And it was all downhill from there. Best Big Day Out ever. - Getting a driver to pick us up from the Big Day Out! The most outrageous thing I had ever done at that point - Convincing Benno to come to Revolver by promising him a dirty pash - Grove driving us to HiFi for Muse the next night, completely out of heads. Me freakin out looking at Furze whilst Crackers talks business with various huge Industry people. - Having an orgasm during the concert, then freaking out when the guy next to me has an epileptic fit. - Blurting out my favourite line whilst wasted \"I wanna trash a hotel room!!!!\" and Crackers replying to my surprise \"yeah Let's do it!\" .... so we did - Furze cracking it at the Westin reception for not giving us good porn ... on time - Me being ultra pissed off, having to DJ RockRoom whilst furze and Crackers are at the Strokes, they come in off their face of course and do lines behind the dj booth. (JUST OCCURRED TO ME I HAVEN'T GOT OUT OF THE FIRST WEEK YET!!) - Julian Casablancas cracking the shits and storming out of the Marriott hotel he he he so funny - Various nights out with Grove the Driver to Honky Tonks, Cherry, Pony, Ding Dong etc lots of expensive champagne and drugs flying around. - My Birthday party which was just tooooo outta control for words!! But I'd have to say my all time favourite memory f the extravagance of summer is: Poodle sitting in a massive suite at the Westin Hotel, in a hotel bath robe, stubbing out her cigarette in a Pringles container, then freaking out coz it wouldn't go out. Furze's solution: pour a bottle of Moet into it. Hilarious. The End .... or is it?\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Meanwhile I am SO PISSED OFF!!! Muse are playing at Festival Hall.

Such is life in the School of Rock. But regardless of what shit I may get for it, I've found myself slipping into Emo life. I'm wearing my glasses more often than I really should, wearing a lot of stripey scarves and re-realising the brilliance of Ben Kweller's 'Sha Sha' album. Hopefully this is where it ends. I pray god I don't end up crying over an accoustic guitar listening to Dashboard Confessional . Then I really would be on the lower end of the music industry class food chain.

The music was just like a fantastic conglomeration of divine screeching, driving and powerful sounds, using vocals as a more confronting instrument than a rockin guitar. They're called Die, Die, Die And they're from New Zealand and they're doin some gigs around town for the next couple of days, think they're at the Tote tonight.

And it's been pretty worth it I can tell you. Booya! Like, just amazing. It's just the little things that make New york such a great darn city. Like the pizza, and the cool little deli's on every corner, and the Interpol/Cure/Muse concerts. And the people you meet really make the place too. Like Gino, the guy who owns the porn store down below the apartment I'm in. Or Sandra who will play chess against you in the park and beat you, as long as you part with a fiver. And Robert Smith, the slightly portly lead singer of the Cure, who was kind enough to interrupt his conversation with matt belamy long enough to give me the time of day at some party on saturday night.

All choreographed very well. Today I read that the dood responsible for putting that sport into the Olympics and further onto world recognition, was jailed for corruption and bribery charges. Of course many of you readers would be like, yeah is the nature of politics, but in Korea, it's almost near permanent custom (example: it's customary to tip the nurses and doctors for better treatment, old school, but still happens. example: girls/wives being sold to strange people at the cost of their own debt from bribery). Everyone there IS corrupt because once you're in the cycle, you have to play along. Otherwise, you'll loose everytime. In the US, it's more subdued because the population is soo much larger. Linking to the movie - Last Samurai (tom cruise and all), I deeply feel that South Korea has lost their identify and are not acting like teenagers (\"who am I?\"). North Korea being like the bastard son is say \"I'll kill everyone and commit suicide if I have to get noticed!\". All cultural aspects (movies, music, news, business practice, TV dramas) are all westernized, having a super-sentimental love scene, and hearing Little Kim in the background. Current pop music is also tainted because all the guys have no balls. It's like listening to Michael Jackson doing a Dr Dre number. In the broad picture, I believe that South Korea is trying to do the right thing. I still have hope, but I get dissappointed by the country almost every week. An example is New Song-do City. I was thinking about going there to help build this city and to live there. The Inchon Airport is expected to traffic 50% of all flights when this city is complete. But as with business practices in that country, it's likely that a few people will goto jail for bribery. Projecting backwards, my dad at my age graduated with an architecture degree and had a very respectable job. His designs were incorporated into many new villages and cities of the time. But he dropped everything, packed a single suitcase, gathered all his cash, and came here to start completely over. For me, it's almost impossible for me to do that sicne I've already started my career track. To drop this and goto a different country (without knowing the language) takes some balls to do. My mom did the same thing as with many other koreans of the time. Doing some analysis, I'm glad that I'm here instead of Korea. although part of me will regret the awesome developments happening over there, I'll be miles away from the corruption that breeds there. The fresh immigrants today or FOBs (fresh off the boat) all have that corruption and it divides the korean amerian societies here. Another disappointment is the Korean army. A recent Korean law states that any male between 18-35 who are of Korean decent must report to the Korean Army regardless of citizenship. As the story goes, a Korean male (US born) in the US army was pulled from his company to go serve in the Korean army. Absoluetly insane. Ok, I'll stop there. I hope the US and S.

Obviously, my first hypothesis is to switch the order of the sections and write out the jpg file. I wrote the whole analysis thing in a php class and seems to work. just need to verfy things here and there. My class is also buggy and doesn't output the complete binary data stream. After I fixed my own bugs, then I can conclusively say if my method fixed the problem or not and possibly send the suggestion to PHP or GD, when I figure out where the problem lies (more about this below). There have been suggestions that the problem might be stemming from the GD library itself, but I'm not sure about that. To make this assumption conclusive, I'm going to need to know how mozilla handles jpg images or if just hands it off to the gd library too. If mozilla uses the GD library, then the problem is in PHP. If not, then it's probably a Gd library problem and I need ask someone there. I'll probably do this in my next stage of testing. I've looked through the PHP source code and my head starts to spin. Currently learning the ZEND developer docs at php.net. One thing that amazed me is that it's possible to make an online hex editor. If this is so, then it might be possible to make a php based assemmbly simulator. If this is possible, the other applications can be made with just php and it's possible to start my Global Terminal computing idea to reality (Linux user space and other techs). Sure, sure Java can be used, but php had more potential to grow (unless java become open source). Also, I haven't been able to find a limitation of PHP. Maybe my projects aren't ambitious enough. It's also my hopes that during my inquires to aid me in my quest, people will start to realize PHP can be used for things not previously thought of. I've also did a google news posting. Hopefully I'll get an answer. ----------------------------------------- Hello, I'm doing a number of personal experiments with jpg images and I havea few questions. Most of the question comes from the binaryrepresentation of the jpg file. 1. JPG File structure order preservationWith reference to this link http://www.geocities.com/tapsemi/datastruct.html Does the order of the different sections need to be preserved? If not,how much section swapping can one do without loosing the file identityof a jpg file? (In another words: What are the terms of sectionswapping) 2. Duplicate image detectionI'm curious as to which of the sections in the jpg file can be used touniquely identify the image regardless of the image size. I'm playingwith the idea of using the DCT or Hoffman encoding section as meansfor identification. I currently have an algorithm that takes pixelinformation every 10 pixels on a diagonal line on the image. Theemphasis is on rapid identification/dulicate detection. My goal is toidenfity 1,000,000+ images per second with a 7200rpm ATA HDD on asingle processor ~2Ghz computer and scalable within a HPC environment(cluster actually) 3. JPG File structure referencesWhere can I find more information about the JPG file structure fromthe binary point of view? I'm looking into the possibility of usingjpgs as 'DNA' maps/masks for signal processing of high speed digitalcommunications. If work in this area has already been established,please send me some references. 4. Legalities of Reverse EngineeringI'm wondering if it's legal to do these types of reverse engineeringwithout having a copy of the JPG standard (I know it helps to have it,but more content rich and fun doing it in reverse) Thanks in advaced. It's my hope to to develope something useful forthe community. James ----------------------------------------- Sometimes I wonder if I've gone mad.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "First blog entry.

The technology is edging closer and closer, to discovering which areas of the brain are active during certain thought processes, it is now only a matter of time. Caplan gives a convincing argument as to why it is ethical for us to develop the tools to detect lying, and modify our brains and the way the work. Such modifications may enable us to learn at incredible paces. French in an hour, read faster, remember things perfectly. Who wouldn't want to learn a new language in an hour? Or read a book in minutes. Have perfect memory, or erase past traumas. If we had a machine that could tell if someone was lying, one would have to define a lie. You couldn't really find the truth in such a machine, just what the person believes to be true; what actually happened versus, their perceptions. (That point came up in talking to JohnnyMac) Scientists who looked at brainwave outputs saw differences in activity in regions of the brain from lies and truths. Apparently it takes less work for the brain for one to tell the truth. Of course one could tell a lie with impunity if one would believe the lie they told, but then at that point, it ceases to become a lie. But at what point do our enhancements stop? Just because we make ourselves better, faster, and smarter, should we? At what point do we become less human? Earlier this year a Nasa project urlLink surfaced to setup 'mind readers' at Airports to \"detect passengers who potentially might pose a threat.\" Do we trust the government to use such a power? One does not have to be paranoid to see such a power being abused by political powers. If Stalin had the ability to detect someone's 'intentions,' do you not think he would have done it? What would a president do to protect a nation? Scan everyone to find the terrorists in our midst? We live in a time where the government sees everyone as a potential threat, a potential terrorist. Are we as a people responsible enough to handle such a power? I think not. Sounds like urlLink 1984 ? So does many things that our urlLink government is urlLink currently urlLink doing . At the point that it becomes possible to give people perfect memory, it will become possible to fabricate memories, or erase them. At the point one could fix brain defects and cure people of schizophrenia, you could give people these diseases. With the power to create, and fix, comes the power to destroy. Is it worth opening this box? Do the benefits outweigh the dangers? That's something that will have to be debated. But certainly, just because we can do something, doesn't mean that we should. I for one, do not wish to have a perfect memory. There is something about how memories fade... Often one remembers thing better than they actually were. Perhaps, there is bliss in my ignorance. I don't mind it, it is part of the human experience. Perhaps that is something that will change with time. ~Ben\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Now, as far as Video and Computer games go, I do not shy away from the violent ones.

Something I learned while I was still young. Something that Israel, or the Palestinians have learned. Terrorism is generally regarded as a dispicable act. Strap a bomb to yourself and take out as many of the \"enemy\" as possible - often times civilians. But all warfare is horrible. To condemn assymetrical terrorism as a crime against humanity, and yet not \"conventional\" warfare, seems downright hypocritical. Does not the seemingly random bombing and missleing of Palestinians terrify them? Is it not itself a form of terrorism? To make the people of Palestine - those who are fighting - submit to the wishes of the Israelis? Isn't that the definition of warfare - make one side submit by force.

He may have been born in 780, or around 800; he may have died in 845, or around 840. He was born in the town of Khwarizm (now Khiva), in Khorasan province of Persia (now in Uzbekistan). The name al-Khwarizmi means the person from Khwarizm. His family moved soon afterward, to a place near Baghdad, where he accomplished most of his work in the period between 813 and 833. There are various guesses at his native languages, including Persian or more probably Khwarizmian (now dead). All of Al-Khwarizimi's works were written in Arabic. He developed the concept of the algorithm in mathematics (which is a reason for his being called the grandfather of computer science by some people), and the words \"algorithm\" and \"algorism\" come from Latin and English corruptions of his name. He also made major contributions to the fields of algebra, trigonometry, astronomy, geography and cartography. His systematic and logical approach to solving linear and quadratic equations gave shape to the discipline of algebra, a word that is derived from the name of his 830 book on the subject, Hisab al-jabr wa al-muqabala (\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0628\u0631 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0629 in Arabic). While his major contributions were the result of original research, he also did much to synthesize the existing knowledge in these fields from Greek, Indian, and other sources. He appropriated the place-marker symbol of zero, which originated in India, and he is also responsible for the use of Arabic numerals in mathematics. Al-Khwarizmi systematized and corrected Ptolemy's research in geography, using his own original findings. He supervised the work of 70 geographers to create a map of the then \"known world\". When his work became known in Europe through Latin translations, his influence made an indelible mark on the development of science in the West: His algebra book introduced that discipline to Europe and became the standard mathematical text at European universities until the 16th century. He also wrote on mechanical devices like the clock, astrolabe, and sundial.

Sometimes, I like to think to myself how I've never gotten what I've wanted. Perhaps, I should think rather, that I've never wanted what I've gotten. And I wonder about the things I've done to be in this position. I know she is right. Only thing is, it feels like everything is closer than it is, and I have to be reminded that Christmas doesn't come this year. Especially for someone who's done what I've done. But I've learned how quickly one can descend into weakness. I don't want to be there again either. So comes possibly the hardest thing I've ever done. Letting go. Either it'll come or it won't. One of my major faults is forcing something when I'm frustrated - to make it work - instead of patience and a steady heart. Whether or not things work out the way I want them to - is ok. There will be tomorrow, other people, other things. It helps, not to be so self absorbed. But I think that I'm often a poor observer. I'd like to think I wasn't always caught up in my head...but I am. Perhaps its the caffiene, or my nuttiness. There is this baby boy in the seat ahead of me, his kind, new eyes staring back at me. How can't you help but stare back? The little girl across from the aisle is playing with her cat, entertaining the boy. Sometimes the people are more entertaining than the movie... Another flight back to the west coast. Not for long enough. Even thought it feels like my heart is being stretched like a rubberband from San Fransisco to Chicago. So i pray now and forever that I can be the person that I want to be, and need to be. That those around me can forgive my sins, that God can too. That despite my wrongs, that he will have enough mercy on me to let me achieve my happiness, and let it not be at the expense of someone elses. So, I guess you are right, Sammie, tears are my muse.

FOR PUBLICATION - PLEASE SEND TO YOUR LOCAL PAPER ... Canaries of the World - the Akha July 17, 2004 ... Karen Gaia Pitts They call me Ah-Piew. It could mean 'Hey you' or something less complimentary, but judging from the hugs and tears at the bus station as I see the grandparents off - back to their village to tend to their rice - it must mean something much nicer. I call them - the Akha hilltribe people and the other tribal and indigenous people - 'the canaries of the world', refering to the old expression, 'canaries in a coal mine'. It is the Akha, along with many other tribal and indigineous peoples, that have a sustainable way of life. The Akha have terraced farms and have been in one location for up to 80 years. It is their simpler life that is sustainable on this planet. Ours, with our modern agriculture (i.e. oil-based fertilizer), and our extensive transportation infrastructure, was built up on a fossil fuel economy. Instead of using our wealth wisely, saving most of it for future generations, we have foolishly spent it until now we are having to wage wars resulting in the deaths of millions of people, to protect what we have become used to - the 'American Way of Life'. And now it is the Akha and other tribals and indigineous who have become oppressed by those with the wealth and power - their traditional lands and their very culture are being threatened. They are threatened by rich Thais who want their land and their hot springs for mountain retreats; by the government who wants their land to plant pine plantations, to replace the vast teak forests that have all but disappeared from Thailand; and by the border skirmishes between Myanmar (Burma) and Thailand. In other parts of the world, tribal people are pushed off their land when dams are built, or when oil or gold is discovered on their land. The Akha, when moved to other lands, usually inferior lands, cannot feed their families. The women, with their husbands in jail, often have to resort to prostitution just to feed their families. They are also caught up in the so-called 'war on drugs'. They are near the 'Golden Triangle', where Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand meet, and where gold and drugs have been traded since the British introduced opium to the area in the 1800s. Opium is now a traditional palative for the ailments of old age. Opium users have a place and function in Akha society, but not in Thai society. A large number of Akha men are now in prison for various drug offenses, many without a proper trial, many undergoing beatings or shock treatments as a way of 'rehabilitation'. Last year over 2,000 Akha were killed outright by the Thai police, without a trial. And then they are also victims of well-meaning (and some not-so-well-meaning) missionaries, who put the Akha children in Christian boarding schools and tell them their language and their culture and their parents are no good. Much like what was done to Native American children during the last centrury. So now Matthew McDaniel, the champion of the Akha people in the Chiang Rai (Thailand) area has been deported. He had no chance to get his Akha wife, 7 months pregnant, and 3 children, out of the country. That is why I am here, because I believe in what Matthew is doing. I am pushing the paperwork needed to get Ah Chooh (MeeChooh), the mother, and Ah Soh (4), Mee Daw (3), and Ah Tsah (2) on a plane to the U.S. - hopefully a month before the baby comes. There is a serious concern that if the baby is born in a Thai hospital, the mother will be sterilized against her wishes. The family is delightful, and I am finding it very enjoyable working with them. But it is a strain on Ah Chooh, being run around, getting passports, signatures on this and that. We have been running around working on the details for 10 days now. And where is the U.S. Consulate or Embassy on this matter? Why aren't they helping? Why aren't the mother and children in the U.S. already? Matthew was deported April 15. Why does it have to be up to an American woman who doesn't know Thai and doesn't know Akha - who knew almost nothing about Thai or American legal procedure - to get this done? And will I get it done in time? And why was it so easy for the American man I met on a songchow (a small pickup truck that serves as a bus) to get his Thai wife into the U.S., yet so hard for Matthew to get his pregnant wife and children there? Matthew McDaniel is not allowed to come to Thailand to help his family. But he can help the Akha. He is now on his way to Geneva to attend a UN conference on Indiginous People.

And while I appreciate your global view I think you are missing an important caveat that must be considered with every outsourcing proposal: accountability. I work in the information technology field where outsourcing is a major topic of concern. Furthermore, I work for the State so your piece really piqued my interest. Still, I have to grant that there are some tasks can be successfully outsourced. I'm thinking primarily of help desk phone assistance. As long as the person on the other end of the line knows their subject and can communicate effectively, it does not matter where on the globe that person is. Unfortunately, it has been my experience that those first two hurdles are rarely cleared. But what is lost with poor help desk assistance? Time? Customer satisfaction and loyalty? And, ultimately the customer usually has other resources available online or at their local bookstore. But what about manufacturing? We saw many mills and jobs drift over our borders due to NAFTA. Economically, I think the jury may still be out on this one, but from a jobs perspective it does not look good. But what of the products made? Has the quality been maintained? Sometimes. Perhaps even often. And when the quality has slipped, who pays the price? Who is accountable? If the company is US-based, there is usually some recourse. However, often the money saved in using third world labor far offsets the complaints of a customer base that has learned to simply shrug and accept what is put before them. Now let's examine your proposal: outsourcing the DMV (and, I imagine, other governmental functions?). The government, by force of law, requires that we relinquish some very precious confidential information. There must be a bond of the utmost trust between us. What happens when that trust is betrayed? Who is accountable when information that opens wide the door to our entire lives becomes a commodity traded out of identity mills in Indonesia? And what good is accountability once our lives have been stolen? No, the bond between a government and its citizens is far too intimate to relinquish our secrets to a third party.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "This was forwarded to me by a friend and associate who is far brighter and more knowledgeable than myself.

This is real food for thought Hey David, I thought you might like this. Dennis Liberals claim President Bush shouldn't have started this war. They complain about his mismanagement of it. One liberal recently claimed Bush was the worst president in U.S. history. Worst in history... Don't know about that-but bottom 5. Let's clear up one point: President Bush didn't start the war on terror. Neither did Iraq. However, in focusing on Iraq instead of Afghanistan, he allowed Bin Laden and Al Qaida to get out, reform and regroup. Furthermore, with the way he attacked a sovereign nation who had done nothing to us, he is making it easier for Al Qaida to recruit new terrorists. Because of that, Al Qaida has committed more acts of terrorism and is responsible for more deaths since 9/11 than in the three years leading up to it. Remember, Bin Laden attacked us. And what did Bush say about him 6 months after the attack? \"I don't know where he is. I have no idea and I really don't care. It's not that important. It's not our priority.\" Try to remember, it was started by terrorists BEFORE 9/11. OK, let's look at the \"worst\" president nominees and \"mismanagement\"claims. FDR led us into World War II. Germany never attacked us, Japan did. From 1941-1945, 450,000 lives were lost, an average of 112,500 per year. Germany declared war on us within 3 days of the Pearl Harbor attack, before we sent a single troop over there, and in addition they had invaded several of our allies. Not sure how anyone with an understanding of history could compare the two situations. Truman finished that war and started one in Korea. North Korea never attacked us. From 1950-1953, 55,000 lives were lost, an average of 18,333 per year. Korea was a mistake and a disaster to begin with. However, glad you brought it up. Around that same time we had a thing called McCarthyism. A time when the Constitution was thrown out the window and the government was spying on it's citizens and had neighbors spying on each other. It was one of the darkest, most shameful things to occur in America since the abolition of slavery and the massacre of the Indians in the 1800s. One would think we would have learned from history not to repeat it, but then along came John Ashcroft and The Patriot Act. McCarthyism with a fancy name. John F. Kennedy started the Vietnam conflict in 1962. Vietnam never attacked us. Johnson turned Vietnam into a quagmire. From 1965-1975, 58,000 lives were lost, an average of 5,800 per year. Another disaster which will historically harm Kennedy, LBJ, and Nixon to boot. And Iraq is looking like another Vietnam. The difference of course is that Vietnam was one of only several tests those three were given. Civil rights, normalizing relations with Russia and China, the Cuban Missile crisis etc. The whole of Iraq can be boiled down to one thing. Bush has only been tested once. We were attacked by Al Qaida. Bush responded by invading the wrong country. Clinton went to war in Bosnia without UN or French consent. Bosnia never attacked us. We did not go to war with Bosnia. We did not send troops over take over the country. Bad analogy. Clinton was offered Osama bin Laden's head on a platter three times by Sudan and he did nothing. Untrue. It is one of those urban legends that Republicans like to chant (like the Clintons vandalizing the White House), but the reality is that it never happened. Read Richard Clarke's book. Clinton was after Bin Laden for a long time and would have grabbed him if given the opportunity. Osama has attacked us on multiple occasions. Over 2,900 lives were lost on 9/11. I know, and so did Clinton. However, Republican lies are not the same thing as facts. BTW...9/11 happened on Bush's watch, not Clintons. No small part of that was that one of the first things Bush did was to cut the anti terrorism budget that had grown 7 fold during the Clinton administration and had Condi Rice take her focus off of Al Qaida (which is where it was under Clinton's watch) and instead focus on Iraq. In the two years since terrorists attacked us, President Bush has liberated two countries, rushed the Taliban, crippled al-Qaida, put nuclear inspectors in Lybia, Iran, and North Korea without firing a shot, and captured a terrorist who slaughtered 300,000 of his own people. He also responded to the greatest attack on America in the history of the country by sending 11,000 troops over to find someone in a country almost the size of Texas. In so doing, the bad guys got away and are now most likely hiding in a Muslim country with nuclear capabilities. Instead of focusing on Al Qaida, Bush instead invaded a sovereign nation who had neither threatened us, nor had the ability to do so. He gave us a black eye in the Muslim world and is making it a lot easier for Al Qaida to recruit eager people looking to get the USA. As a result, not only is Al Qaida not crippled, but stronger and more active a presence in the world than they were before. That is what Bush has accomplished. We have lost 600 soldiers, an average of 300 a year. And killed in excess of 10,000 citizens of a country which had not attacked us, not declared war on us, not threatened us, nor were responsible for the death of any Americans. Bush did all this abroad while not allowing another terrorist attack at home. Your point? Care to look at the numbers? Under Clinton 36 Americans died at the hands of foreign terrorists (and 17 of them were on the Cole which happened just before Bush took over. Bush decided not to pursue the perpetrators.) Under Reagan 535 Americans died at the hands of foreign terrorists. Under Bush, it is over 3,000. Furthermore, if you break it down further, most of the victims of terrorists in both the Clinton and Reagan administrations occurred abroad. Why are you taking the terrorist attacks that took American's lives abroad under Bush off the table? Worst president in history? Sure doesn't appear to be Bush! No, probably Grant, Harding, and Buchanan. Then Bush. The Democrats are complaining about how long the war is taking, but... It took less time to take Iraq than it took Janet Reno to take the Branch Davidian compound. That was a 51 day operation. In 51 days, it was over. Over a year after Bush declared victory, American soldiers are still dying over there on pretty much a daily basis. Don't know if you realize that a war isn't over when one country is still fighting and killing occupying forces just because Bush says it is over. We've been looking for evidence of chemical weapons in Iraq for less time than it took Hillary Clinton to find the Rose Law Firm billing records. And what has been found in that time? Since Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Colin Powell all said that they knew where the WMDs were, why haven't they found them yet? But if you want to play silly history games, it also took less time than it took Bush to report for his National Guard duty in Alabama. And considerably less time than it took him to come clean about his criminal record. It took less time for the 3rd Infantry Division and the Marines to destroy the Medina Republican Guard than it took Teddy Kennedy to call the police after his Oldsmobile sank at Chappaquiddick.

As with any consumer product, the use of the product is in direct proportion to the consumer\u0092s perception of the quality of the product. While the creation of literature is art, the reading of literature is essentially an act of consumption; and time is the medium of exchange in the marketplace of entertainment. While the rate at which Americans read literature dropped 7 percentage points in the decade from 1992 to 2002 (double the rate of decline when compared with the decade from 1982 to 1992), the rate of decline in overall book readership remained fairly level (about 3 to 4 percentage points). Admittedly the decline in overall readership is due to the rise of electronic media, but there is a larger question. Why is literature losing market share when compared to other books? The memoirs of various public figures and other non-fiction works from Chicken Soup for the series to the works of the Dalai Lama have overshadowed almost all other publishing with the exception of Harry Potter. So, why are readers choosing to spend their time (capital) to read non-fiction instead of literature? Quality. Any time a written work is transformed into a film or \u0093book on tape\u0094 elements of the original work are lost. In the past, the perception of the quality of the literary experience was such that most readers believed the electronic version of literature to be inferior; that it lacked an important level of detail when compared with the original work. As the decline in literature readership suggests, this perception is changing. It appears that the perception of the quality of the literary experience has declined to the extent that consumers consider the electronic version of the original work to be \"good enough\" and so, spend their reading capital on other works. \"I'll wait for the movie,\" a phrase that was once a joke, has become a fact for most Americans. (For example, most people have seen far more Michael Crichton or John Grisham movies than have read the origal novel.) The real challenge for those concerned in increasing literary readership is one of marketing. Literature is both art and product; and if you want Americans to read more literature, you have to increase demand for the product. To increase that demand, you have to improve the consumer's perception of the quality of the product. By overstating it's case, the NEA has given fuel to critics that claim the agency is out of touch with mainstream America. By citing dubious correlations as evidence of direct causality, the credibility of the report is compromised. By choosing to bemoan Americans as a bunch of e-media addicts instead of examining the causes of the decline in literary readership and the need to improve American appreciation for literature, and the arts in general, the NEA reinforces it's reputation as cerebus of the artistically elitist status quo. Unfortunately, the NEA report makes poor reading for all the wrong reasons.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Hmm...Presumptive Democratic nominee for president John Kerry names the charismatic John Edwards as his running mate amid the cheers and lauding of Dems from all over.

Last year, I finally convinced the missus to wean herself away from Kaiser and try something different. Besides, we were aiming to get our learning disabled daughter into the urlLink MIND Institute out of UC Davis. Well, UCDMed doctors near our home weren't taking any new patients so we signed up with Sutter...and loved it. The medical offices are conveniently close. Getting an appointment is generally easy and quick. And the whole atmosphere is far less stressful. PLUS, Sutter has some of the pre-eminent pediatric neurologists and neurosurgeons. Skipping the boring details, we had another MRI done on our daughter and the medicos were able to spot a tiny legion (less than 3mm) in her brain. Her previous MRI, done several years ago, missed this as the technology did not provide the necessary level of detail. What this means is that this is the likely cause of her seizures and could potentially be removed with surgery. I gotta tell ya, the first time that prospect was brought up to me I was rather strongly against it. The idea of someone cutting into my daughter's head kind of freaked me out. I was hoping that we could just continue the meds and maybe the onset of puberty might mitigate her seizures (as odd as that sounds it was suggested to us by one of her previous doctors as a possibility). However, I've come around and we are pursuing urlLink this possibility . Naturally, several tests must be performed to ensure that the area to be removed is not near anything \"important\"--i.e. speech, memory, motor and/or sensory control areas. Strange to think that there are unimportant portions of the brain but since we only use about 4-6% I guess there's some wiggle room. In mid-April we met with the surgeon, a urlLink wonderful woman who says Maddy seems like a good candidate for surgery. Next step is for her to be observed with an EEG during several seizures. This means an overnight (or 2) stay while she is off her meds. We decided to postponed this until this summer so she'd be out of school. (Interesting note: Dr. Z. is also on staff with UCD so whatever path we took would have eventually led to her. Hmm, fate seems to have had this one decided for us.) Then when we called in June to schedule the observation, we discovered that Dr. Z (the neurosurgeon) had gone on sabbatical. It seems she was on the verge of completing some groundbreaking research that would visually identify the damaged brain tissue making surgery that much more accurate (better than EEG MRI mapping, I'm guessing). Whether it is the sabbatical or just a bureaucratic snafu, the communication broke down somewhere between the neurosurgeon, the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), the neurologist, and the primary care physician. I spoke with various assistants and then waited for someone to get back to me. Called again. Waited again. Called again. Got a different number to call since the paperwork had been forwarded on to the EMU. Called that number and got voice mail. Waited. Got a call back. More bureaucratic dancing. Finally after mentioning (for about the third time) that the request was initiated by Dr. Z and not Dr. A, the neurologist, a light went on for the person on the other end. Waited just a bit more. Got a call back and Maddy is scheduled to go in after Dr. A gets back from his vacation: August 9. This will be immediately following her sister coming back from urlLink camp --the same camp Maddy had to miss because we were never able to schedule her time in the EMU. We assume she will have at least a portion of her head shaved for the EEG. This, on top of the possibility of brain surgery, has our daughter quite upset as she will have to start school in just a few weeks afterwards. I keep telling her though that for the price of a few weeks of not looking like you're used to, you may very well be free of seizures for the rest of your life. And that she'd be able to concentrate better and do better in school. I keep telling myself that, too. Dr. A. told us that 70% of patients deemed as good candidates for surgery are seizure free afterwards. Those are pretty good odds, I think.

So, we decide to put a few blocks of pressurized wood under a few of the supports. We bought enough to go under all of the supports and that was our original plan but it didn't seem necessary. Well, I get a rather quick response from my boss that the program I just put into production is kicking out bad data and I'm needed ASAP. Left unsaid is the recent talk we had about the many hours here and there I've been missing for various family needs. So, back to the pool. We think that if we prop up the middle supports with the wood blocks it will help level the pool. I do about four on one side and three on the other, just where it was sagging the most or the poles were really loose with too much slack. The wife is not sure and suggests that we (and by \"we\" she means me) put blocks under all the poles. It sounds like a good idea but I'm already running way late for work and I gotta get out of there, besides the pool finally looks completely level like never before. I go off to work and we start the filling of the pool. This evening as I get home it is about a foot deep and the middle sections are now sagging inward. We figure that as the water level rises, they will bow back out. We continue to fill the pool. Now, about twelve hours after we first turned on the hose, the sag is even worse and the wife and I are getting worried. I do a google on \"soft sided pool\" and \"filling\" and I discover a little tidbit: \"Important: if you use blocks, you must use them under ALL supports to prevent undue stress on the frame.\" Well, Jesus H. Tap-dancing Key-rist on a pony! There's about 18\" of water in my pool now and I've got to either pull the blocks out or put new ones under those supports without any. I go around to the far side and discover that the ground is flooded. I check for air bubbles from the pool thinking maybe the stress cause a seam to split but I see no sign of damage. It must be from my backyard neighbors. I've had that happen before. But this also tells me that I cannot remove the blocks because that side will often be soggy. No, I need to block every support. So now, I've rigged a siphon hose and the pool is draining. I doubt it'll be empty enough by 6am tomorrow (that's when I'd be available before work to fix the pool) for me to work on it. This will be very disappointing to my daughters but then if we were to break the pool, it would be even more disappointing and expensive.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "We can't make fun women, Jews, Asians, Native Americans, Latinos, and certainly not African Americans.

But Sam Raimi does it. The direction, the fantastic use of the camera, during the battle on the train was phenomenal. Not just capturing the same kind of framing that is used in comic books, but also jarring us with chaotic angles that take us into a sort of Spidey's-eye view of the world. And Kristen Dunst...ahhhhh. I do so like the red headed ladies. McGuire and Molina were more than fine in their respective roles, although I didn't really see the chemistry between them--something you only very rarely see in films--a sub-sensory visceral connection between hero and villain. On the spot now I can only recall it between Keaton and Nicholson in Batman . It is that rare. The romance is touching and noble. The theme of responsibility for one's choices (going a tad beyond the first film's theme of the responsibility that comes with power), is worthy of far more grandiose films. Or you can just sit back and ride the roller coaster. But do yourself a favor and note some of the symbolism such as the the power of great aspirations to lift you above the humdrum of life and how when we give up our dreams we come crashing to earth.

I can only remember the highlights now but I'll do my best to weave them into a coherant narrative. I was attending a rehearsal for a production of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion somewhere up near Lake Tahoe, I believe. Maybe it was an audition. Anyway, a friend/acquaintance who was somehow connected to the production and I went for a walk and found ourselves in the woods. We were set upon by two young thugs who roughed us up a tiny bit. And, while my friend was on the ground, one of the thugs pulled out a pistol and shot him three or four times. Naturally, I ran. I then found myself in nice but not great hotel, kind of like the $120/night places in San Francisco--better than the EconoLodge but not quite Hyatt level. Panicked, I go around trying doors and end up in a room with Janeane Garafalo. She buys my story of the murder in the woods and gives me refuge. We end up watching TV side by side on the couch. Soon we're holding hands and then the TV goes off. I turn to her and she leans in. We kiss, a sweet kiss that soon turns more passionate. My hand moves to her waist and then up inside her t-shirt but she pushes my hand away just as I realize she is not wearing a bra. Held to first base, but that is still so cool cuz I'm kissing Janeane f-ing Garafalo! Soon after that I woke up--DAMMIT!--it was about 3am so I went back to sleep. Next I dream about seeing a production of GBS's Pygmalion starring some Asian/Pacific Islander guy as Professor Higgins. The dude was good but just odd casting. Odd that I would dream so much about a particular literary work, no? But what is Shaw's play about? Transformation of a bright but rough young girl who has been cheated by circumstance into the wonderful, desireable, and self-actualized creature she should be. Such is my hope with my daughter Madeline. She is in the hospital right now under 24-hour observation, hooked up to an EEG and under constant video survelliance to more accurately map her siezures. If they can pinpoint the focus of the siezures to a particular point in her brain, as seems likely given that her MRI showed slight scarring in the area wher the previous EEGs indicated the siezure came from, then she is a good candidate for surgery. A prospect that at once inspires and terrifies me. I mean, we're talking brain surgery here. F-ing with the essential organ of being for my daughter. Just the mere contemplation of it brings tears to my eyes. But on the other hand, this procedure holds a very good chance of curing her from her epilepsy and probably aiding the coping of her learning disabilities as a result of that. Oh, what she could become if this shroud of seizures could be lifted from her! I wonder what transformation she would undergo. Meanwhile, I'm just going to label the friend getting shot and making out with Janeane Garafalo as non sequiter brain dumps. It's just safer that way.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Nearly ten years ago the missus and I did something a little stupid. We bought a brand new minivan. Yes, we knew we'd be losing thousands of dollars in value as soon as we drove off the lot but we wanted a car with no worries, at least for a little while. And it was truly nice to be tooling around in a new car for many, many months. Maybe even a years. But the troubles started coming in. I remember in 1999 or 2000 having the transmission overhauled to the tune of $1900. Ouch. And there's been a serpentine belt that snapped on the way home one dark night. The support arm for the alternator cracked and was about $300 to fix. Then several months ago the passenger door that had been creaking finally gave way. urlLink I chronicled that event in my previous blog . Not resolved to keep the expenses down, the ol' red Caravan urlLink pulled another rabbit out of her hat . So I thought it a good idea to make sure she was in good working order before taking my nine year old off to camp 130 miles away. So after recently having it smogged for its DMV registration, I had the oil changed. During this procedure, the mechanic noticed that the PCV filter needed replacing and that the serpentine belt was cracked in several places (this he showed me; it was all too true). Naturally, I had those things taken care of the very next week. Finally last Friday, two days before taking my girl up to camp, I purchased a full set of brand new tires for just under $500. Ouch, but what what a relief. We had been running around on the spare for nearly a month and the remaining tires were nearly all down to the tread warning bar. We were set for the trip. We get her up to camp near Occidental, CA, with just 15 minutes to spare before the end of registration time--we ran into some unexpected traffic. Get her settled and are on our way about an hour later. As it was just past dinner time we drive over to Bodega for a seafood meal. Unfortunately the bar menu, while cheaper, is far more limited and the oldest daughter likes her shrimp grilled, not breaded and fried. So we opt for the restaurant. It was quite good but not fantastic. The portions were quite large and I just assumed they'd box up the half-a-meal I left behind (pasta primavera w/ salad shrimp added). Nope. I guess some cat was very happy that night. And then it's back on the road for home. We hit a bit of a delay just as Rte. 12 connects with US-50. It's down to a single lane during some nighttime construction work. After about ten minutes, though we are on our way. But just as we are crossing the great overpass that joins us up with Highway 50, the engine revs up inexplicably and there's no power to the wheels. We are just coasting. Fortunately it is downhill but once momentum is gone we start slowing down. Eventually, I discover that if I turn off the engine and then restart it I can accellerate for about twenty yards before the transmission disconnects again. I hobble to an off ramp and call my insurance's 24-hour line. They say they might reimburse my towing expense but can't be sure because for some reason they could not pull up my policy. It's just after midnight and I decide to deal with it in the morning. The exit we are at is pitch dark save for the glow of the AutoMall sign in the distance so I limp the van to the next exit down. Fortunately, that's the one with about a half dozen fast food joints and diners and about as many motels. The Holiday Inn Express costs more than we have on us (no, we have no credit cards). In order to use my mother-in-laws AmEx card, she'd have to fax them a copy of her driver's license. That's more of a hassle than I'm willing to put her through. But the desk clerk gives us a line on a cheaper place: the Inns of America. That's when I discover that we don't have any reverse as well as any forward gears. I have to push the van out of the parking spot with a bad knee earned over the weekend (see previous post). Actually it only hurts when twisted not during normal pressure, so when the older teen offerst to help, I tell her to stay in the car. We make it down the road in fits and starts and it turns out that with her contribution we scrape together just enough to get us all a room. It should be a relief, and to a great degree it was. We call my mother-in-law to update her and she agrees to meet us the next morning around 9am. Sack time. However, my middle daughter gets up about a dozen times that night to the bathroom and my oldest (the one with the cash) ends up getting sick in the middle of the night. Too much stress, seafood, and probably some allergies as well. Fortunately she makes it to the toilet and there's no extra mess which is good because if I smell it, I'm compelled to add my own. But the poor thing, I felt bad for her and would've forced her to accept a hug from ol' dad if I wasn't exhausted. Next day: Girls seem well, if tired. Ma-in-law shows up promptly as I'm negotiating a tow and locating a transmission repair shop. Breakfast at Denny's. Meet with the tow truck at the motel. Check out and then meet up again at the transmission place. Hand over the van and head on back home. That afternoon the verdict comes in: $2400. If the van were in \"good\" condition I could maybe get $2200-2500 for it. But I never fixed the door which was going to be $800-$1200. Nope, that price tag was the death knell for Ol' Red. I've started looking into the tax requirements for donating a car to charity. I figure I can claim fair market value at around $800 figuring as I just put $500 worth of tires on it which have less than 200 miles on them. If I had the van home, I'd probably be asking that much. I'll have to collect the documentation. That night we go looking at new cars. I expressly stated that we would NOT be purchasing a car that evening; we'd wait until the next day. However, we found a 1998 Mercury Villager with just 10,540 miles on it, loaded with extras and kept up very nicely. We bought it putting about half the price down in cash which seriously dipped into our rainy-day fund. But heck, it looked pretty wet outside to me. My camping daughter has no idea about any of this. We're going to pick her up on Saturday at 9am. Since we'd have to leave home around 5:30am to make it in time and since there's no way we can wake up two teenagers in time to leave then, tomorrow we're going into Santa Rosa to stay the night, just 20 miles or so from my daughter's camp. Then, I'm taking them all to the urlLink California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. It's one of my middle daughter's favorite places and she goes in to the hospital on Monday for observation of her epilepsy. They'll probably have to shave her head. I want her to have at least one good memory from this summer. Which reminds me, tonight we'll have to make the s'mores she was promised whilst her baby sister was at camp.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Characters: Croo/TSGOF Richard - Current GCSE level student at Langley Park.

Welcome to the Oxfard Croo; Tarquin!!!\" -Chapter 2 : Into the Breach- [Richard wakes in his dorm on-campus, and hastily checks under his bed.] Richard : \"Man, i'm getting paranoid...\" [Sitting at a rudimentary oakwood desk, he flicks on his laptop. The website is still as he left it last night, the weapons cache page at still glowing brightly from the screen. Flicking down he finds what he was looking for. A newspaper and a pringle-top. He recalls the 'fight' he had had with Gaz outside of the library, thankful he had managed to register as an assassin before his 'foe' could find out otherwise. As he sat casually glancing over his Neopets account, his taskbar blinks with the news he has a new email from 'Kwent_3928'] Quentin : \"(via email) Hello Tarquin, it's Quentin. Hope you're awake, and I hope you're at your laptop. How's it working out? We've provided you with the minimum standard specs the rest of 'Da Croo' use, but if you need anything tweaked you can always email either myself or Cuthbert. Don't worry, he still types in English, but try not to enter a voice conversation. Took him ten minutes to say hello. Anyway, like I said, i hope you get this before 9, because we're going to need your help. I won't say anymore, in case Jack's reading this too, but meet in the normal location at 9:20am. See you there. Oh, and you will need your weapons. We'll provide you with the RB's when you get here. Bring gloves. Quentin\" Richard : \"(Typing) Sure, no problem. See you in an hour\" [Having shut his laptop down, Richard crosses to his chest of drawers, taking out a pair of black leather gloves that cover the whole of the hand and the wrist. He takes out a wooden rubberband gun and stuffs it in his jacket, before opening his door. He grabs the door handle on the other side and pulls it shut.] Richard : \"Ah, Vaseline on the doorhandle. Nice try Gaz...\" [Wiping his glove on the door, he walks around for a while before heading to the English Hall. As he walks down the corridor, he sees the reflection of someone following him, with his hand hidden in his jacket.] Richard : \"Ah hell... i can't lead him to da croo... Quentin won't mind if im a little late...\" [He turns] Richard : \"You seem to be following me.\" ????2 : \"Um, yeh, well like Gazza waz like 'fllow im and spark im innit' nd im like nah m8, so he like, tries wif the vasaline on your crib, but den you don't get it so i 'as to follow you innit....\" Richard : \"So do you have a name?\" Ben : \"im ben innit\" Richard : \"Evidently. Well? Telling someone your going to assassinate them isn't the most subtle way of stalking them.\" [Thinking for a moment, Ben's face falls...] Ben : \"Oh yeh... damn.\" [In the same instant, Ben and Richard both draw their weapons. Ben sports a low power water pistol, but he is too far out of range. While he runs at Richard, spraying water in an attempt to get a lucky hit, Richard shoots two rubber bands at Ben, the first sailing over his head, the second catching him in the arm.] Richard : \"That's a hit!\" Ben : \"aw wtf, nah dat is well unfair i didnt do nuttin\" Richard : \"Evidently...\" [Walking away, he leaves, walking down different corridors in an attempt to get his bearings. As he walkes past Romanian Studies 5 he sees Quentin inside. Curiosity getting the better of him, Richard crouches by the door, ear pressed against the wood.] Quentin : \"... that can be expected. I fail to see your concern Charlotte\" Charlotte : \"Hey, i'm only going by what Alexandra told me. Truth is we've had Elizabeth scoping that area for weeks, and its a roodboi hotspot. They're clamping down on literacy once and for all. They've got autobiographies in the library now for Gods sake...\" Quentin : \"We can deal with the level of literacy later. For the moment, we need that book. And if that means a noted assassination then I can handle that. But we need that book.\" Charlotte : \"Ok. but provoke an Evening Massacre, and Alex can't help you\" Quentin : \"Duly noted. I'll see you at Latin\" [Richard darts down the corridor, and runs to the meeting spot. He almost runs headlong into Quentin coming out of the other corridor] Quentin : \"Hi Tarquin. Noone's here yet, you're a little early aren't you?\" Richard : \"I needed to talk to Cuthbert. Register a hit. Gaz's friend. Met him on the way.\" Quentin : \"Sure. Come one on, you can use the terminal in the corner\" [They enter the English hall, Quentin taking his place at a desk in the corner, shuffling books around, before propping 'The Colour of Magic' up on the wall and beginning to read. Richard takes his laptop out of his bag and plugs it into the phoneline in the corner. After ten minutes of descriptive writing skills he posts news of his kill in the halls outside the room he currently sits in. By the time he has unplugged the laptop and taken a seat, the rest of 'Da Croo' have arrived.] Partario : \"ere kwent i gt yr email. whts ths all abt?\" Quentin : \"Ok, we're hitting the library again.\" Seigfried : \"I thought all library op's were a no-no until roodboi presence diminished. I went to return Alan Shearer's Autobiography for a friend and was almost strip searched.\" Quentin : \"We have no choice. An off-campus contact needs the book, but he's known by the enemy, and his presence would lead to a nasty confrontation. So, we need to hit it. The basic plan runs down like this. All of us take usual watch points, with the exception of Partario and Tarquin. Partario feigns an assassination attempt, hopefully catching the attention of the Loiterers. Then if they follow him, the watchers of the group will draw their fire from Partario, allowing the distraction required to get Tarquin into the library to get the book. He will withdraw, and those not engaging the enemy will escort him back. Try not to make it too obvious to any of the enemy that we've gone against their rules of conformity. We meet back here, and we hopefully won't see any of our names on the next update of the Assassin's Guild. Any questions?\" Richard : \"What's the book?\" Quentin : \"It's a Level 1 book.\" Richard : \"Lvl 1?\" Seigfried : \"The roodboi's evaluate all items in the school with levels. Depending on that level, they evaluate the users alignment to their cause. Level 90-100 items are common items, food and the like. Nothing that will arouse suspiscion. 75-90 are items that are luxury items, that not all but some have, alcohol, cigarettes usw. 30-74 items are objects that will couse some suspiscion, library cards, reading glasses, books that aren't anything to do with sports and the like. Then 1-29, the items that instantly blow our cover. This book is one of them.\" Quentin : \"And the book is 'The Works of Seamus Heaney'. Poetry found in your possession will get you an instant passage to permanent observation. Once that happens, you will never be free of them.\" Richard : \"Lets try not to get caught then...\" -Operation 1 : Reading Roodboi- [Outside the library, Quentin crouches at the corner of one of the surrounding hallways. A group of ten rood's loiter by the entrance, surreptitiously casing out all students who enter and exit the library, in some cases, even stopping those with books.] Quentin : \"Ten... Partario's quick though, he can outrun them...\" Richard : \"When's he moving?\" Quentin : \"(Checking watch) ....34 seconds... Cuthbert, give him the card.\" Cuthbert : \"010010000110010101110010011001010010110000 1000000101100101101111011101010010000001100111011011 1100100000011000100111100100100000011101000110100001 1001010010000001101110011000010110110101100101001000 0001001010011011110110100001101110001000000100110101 100001011000110100100001100101011011100111001001111001\" Henry : \"Here, you go by the name John MacHenry\" Richard : \"John MacHenry? Classy...\" Quentin : \"Shhhh there he is...\" [As the three watch, Partario steps into the corner, causing all the roods to look his way. Partario grins, and slides an alarm clock down the hall.] Rood : \"AARG MOVE MOVE MOVE\" Rood2 : \"Gt tht lttle SOB\" [as one, 9 of the roods run out of sight after the fleeing Partario. The 1 remaining rood takes the alarm clock and turns the alarm off, only to be hit by a massive jet of water.] Seigfried : \"Best go and get dried off Bennyboy\" Ben : \"aw m8 my freds, wtf iz u doin?\" [Ben leaves] Quentin : \"Tarquin, go. There'll be more inside, but for now consider yourself clear, try not to be seen...\" [Richard stands, looks round both corners, and creeps into the library. Instantly he realises that not being seen will be difficult. At almost every table a group of 4 or 5 roodbois sit looking at a magazine, occasionally looking at the patrons of the library. At one table, 4 women sit. Richard recognises 1 as the person Quentin was talking to before the meeting earlier in the day.] Richard : \"TSGOF...\" [One looks his way, and beckons him over] Alexandra : \"Hey, your that kid Quentin sent to look for the book then?\" Zara : \"Well your out of luck kiddo. All copies of said book have been taken out. We managed to get a copy though, and its under my name, so don't send it back overdue will you\" [Zara takes out of her bag a copy of the book, and hands it to Richard] Richard : \"Thanks\" Alexandra : \"Tell Quentin to see me later. I've found something the Croo might profit from knowing\" Richard : \"...ok..(?)\" [Richard turns to leave, but is pushed out of the way of the door by two rood's running out before him, RBG's drawn. Richard pulls his own out and steps out of the door, the book in his hand taking a rubber band for him.] Quentin : \"TARQUIN, GET BACK TO THE HALL!\" Richard : \"What's going on?\" Quentin : \"They came back and started shooting. For sport or premeditated, i dunno. MOVE!!!\" [Slipping on the polished floor (causing a rubber band to sail through where his head had been) Richard ran back to the hall, put the book on the table and sat, waiting. One by one the croo returned to the hall.] Quentin : \"Anyone get hit?\" Cuthbert : \"0100111101101110011001010010000001110100 01101111001000000111010001101000011001 01001000000110110001100101011001110010 11100010111000101110\" Henry : \"He took one to the leg\" Quentin : \"That all?\" [Nods all around] Quentin : \"Tarquin, log in as Cuth_01100010011001010111001001110100, and register him as DOA.\" [With the tapping of keys, the site is updated to show Cuthbert's 'death'] Quentin : \"Well, I think that went as well as could be expected.\" Siegfried : \"Yeh, I never thought Partyboy could do something right\" Richard : \"Um...where is Partario?\" [As the croo suddenly look shocked at the empty seat, a knock at the door sends shivers down Richard's spine] Gaz : \"ROODBOIS!! OPEN UP!!!\" -Chapter 3 : Compromise Class- [In seconds, the entire croo bolt for Quentin's office. Siegfried calmly walks to the door.] Siegfried : \"Who is it?\" Gaz : \"ROOD's OPEN THIS DOOR YOU BUNCH OF UNSAFE HOMIES!!\" Quentin : \"Tarquin, get in the office. If i see Partario his text speaking arse won\u2019t see another Physics lecture...\" [The door is opened a crack, immediately a massive jet of water rushes past Richard, who feels the coolness in the air as the water sails into the server of the Croo's computers] Siegfried \"Quentin, get them out of here!\" [As Richard dives into the office, Quentin slams the door, a second blast of water splashing into the frosted glass of the door. He ushers them out of a backdoor, where they split up. Richard runs back to his dorm, hoping to get an email out to TSGOF about the compromise of security.] Partario : \"Hi tark.\" Richard : \"What are you doing here?\" Partario : \"lol i waz opin 2 c 1 of u lot cos i av to gve you dis.\" [Partario hands Richard a card. Written on one side is \"WE IZ GONNA OWN YOUR NOOB ASSES IN AN EVENIN' MASSACAR INNIT 730 - LATE BE DARE AND DIE (Light lunch and buffet provided)\"] Richard : \"Get out of here traitor.\" [Partario smirks and walks off.] [In his dorm, Richard conducts his routine check for bombs and contact poison, before clicking the screensaver off of his laptop. The web still functions, as does his MSN and Email accounts. He signs on to his MSN account, and sees two contacts online : DickyBod http://dickybod.blogspot.com, and Quentin@htmlcroo.com. He double-clicks Quentin's name, and begins to type.] Richard : \"Heard of this Evening Massacre?\" Quentin : \"Hold on, let me add someone...\" Richard : \"10-4\" I HATE DA CROO has been added to the conversation Alexandra : \"Hi ho Tarkers :D\" Richard : \"Hi. What\u2019s happening regarding the Massacre\" Alexandra : \"It's already been officially listed on the site as a Grudge Match, so no outside help can be listed in. TSGOF can still participate, since we're a registered sister wing of your guild, but that means the Rood's can do the same\" Richard : \"Meaning...?\" Quentin : \"While we could draft the help of TSGOF, that would allow the Rood's to utilise their brother and sister guilds, and we'd be outnumbered. The best odds we could get is if we went it alone.\" Richard : \"Hm... How's the English room?\" Quentin : \"Dry, and the waterproofing of the server and computers helped stop any damage to our communications. Guys i must be off, i have a Physics lecture in 10\" Richard : \"10-4\" Alexandra : \"Bye de bye\" Quentin : \"Oh, Tarquin, get to the room when you can, Cuthbert may have something very useful for you.\" Alexandra : \"Ok, GOODBYE NOW!!!\" Quentin@htmlcroo.com has left the conversation Alexandra : \"Don't go\" Richard : \"Why, Cuthbert\u2019s not that bad, unless you let him talk...\" Alexandra : \"No, you primitive male, to the Massacre!\" Richard : \"What? Why?\" Alexandra : \"Have you ever seen the write-ups of any rood's guild fight to date? They're dangerous, and I don't think Quentin knows it.\" Richard : \"I can't back out now.

John Kerry said yesterday that he is breaking party ranks to support most-favored-nation trade status for China \u0091I think the president has some strong arguments about some of the assets of most-favored-nation status for China,\u0092 Kerry said.\u0094 (John Aloysius Farrell, \u0093Kerry Breaks Party Ranks To Back China Trade Status,\u0094 The Boston Globe, 6/15/91) In 2000, Kerry Voted In Favor Of Permanent Normal Trade Relations With China. (H.R. 4444, CQ Vote #251: Passed 83-15: R 46-8; D 37-7, 9/19/00, Kerry Voted Yea) Now Kerry Criticizes The Bush Administration For Trading With China. \u0093Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry said on Monday Americans workers were paying the price for President Bush's weak stance on trade with China and other countries. On the bus tour, Kerry singled out the Bush administration's handling of trade with China and said that country was manipulating its currency.\u0094 (Caren Bohan, \"Kerry Pledges Aggressive Trade Stance,\" Reuters, 4/26/04) These are just a few of the many vacillations and thoughtless comments made by Kerry recently. As for his running mate who has made his fortune through some viable lawsuits, but mostly through frivolous and overplayed lawsuits which have hurt the medical community deeply. Doctors are currently having to pay tens of thousands of dollars for insurance to guard themselves against lawsuits, many choosing not to practice any more, and others to deny new patients. Currently the situation in Dallas is evidently to the point that women who do not currently have a OB/GYN are almost unable to get an obstetrician, and will have to end up having their babies in the emergency room with a doctor who has no previous patient knowledge. I am not a doctor myself, I don't even work within the medical profession, but I do have several friends and family who are doctors and nurses. Having the opportunity to gain the insight to these professions has also given me a greater insight to the political underworking dealing with health care. All in all, the Democratic health care agenda would have extremely detrimental effects if implemented. I am currently unemployed and will be making a relatively diminutive salary once I do gain employment, so I may fit the current Democratic demographic stereotype. Well at least the stereotype that the democratic party has positioned itself with. However, I am still intelligent enough to look at the facts and make an educated decision. Yes, there are many things that I believe W could do better, but he is a far better option that the Billionaire, indecisive N.E. aristocratic cardboard box of a competitor.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Well, as the title indicates, this is my first blog experience, so here goes.\n"}, {"target": false, "value": "Idealism is what precedes experience; cynicism is what follows. -David T. Wolf (1943 - ) In talking with a peer at work today that I greatly admire, I asked his opinion on one of the politically charged matters that is plaguing my workplace of late. My quandry is that the mandate from my boss conflicts directly with some of the workplace values I am supposed to exemplify. True that they are some of the lesser values: he's not asking me to do anything illegal or blatantly immoral, and most people deem his practices to be savvy business ones. But the position it puts me in is as follows: whenever I talk to one of my coworkers, I will take the information they volunteer and use it against them to promote my boss' political agenda. He encourages this. He expects this. I strain against this because it just doesn't seem right to me, but this guy plays hardball. Ultimately, it will be his way or the highway. In talking to my coworker, an IT veteran of 25 some-odd years, he shook his head and smiled and said \"M, I forget how young and idealistic you are. Those of us who have worked for some time know that this is just the way things are, and if it isn't one thing, it's another. You just put your head down, and muddle through the ambiguity as best you can, and do the job you are paid to do.\" I have trouble with this but my coworker assures me that everybody knows the rules of this game in a corporate environment and that I will learn them the hard way as well.

I see pictures of you and I smile, for they are in color. I think of you and me, so happy, you deep in my arms and we're happy because we are perfect for eachother. But one day, it crashed and ever since the world lost its color. Why did I have to say what I said and do what I did? Do you know that I'm sorry? Do you know that when I look at your picture, I cry? You know this but you pretend not to care and I know you're mad and life without you is dull and gray. I continue walking down the street and briefly glance into a cafe and the world becomes bright again. The sky becomes blue, the lights flash and the people are happy. My heart restarts as I gaze at the back of your head as you pay for coffee at the counter. I touch the window and as I do, you turn around and once again, color fades from the world again. Alas, it it not you. I feel cheated because the slightest glance at your face would allow my emotions to return. I walk back to my place, opent the door and see you sitting on my couch. I now it's you but there is still no color. What are you doing here? I ask. Because we need to talk, you say. I sit, you sit, we all fall down. I'm sorry for what I did and there are millions of things I want to know, but the words evade me. You see, whether you know it or not, you're the one who keeps me going. I look in the mirror in the morning ans ask \"Why?\", but I see your reflection, much brighter than mine, behind me. You are the physical answer to my question. When I'm driving on a bridge, I think, \"Why not?\", and I see your picture on my dashboard and the light pours out of my car and you once again answer my question. Remember when we first met and I told you that I could read your eyes? You thought I was kidding until I did and you were nervous because everything I said about you was true. When we talked, you were timid and I was not and when and when I said something funny you let out a nervous giggle. When you did something you thought was stupid, I brought you back up by saying it was cute and you giggled again but I was serious. Remember how you said guys didn't like you because you thought your glasses were dumb? I told you there weren't and that your eyes were perfect and your glasses only made you prettier. You thought I was being sarcastic but when I leaned over and kissed you, everything in the world was perfect. There was no pain, no war, no , no hunger. All was full of love and you knew it and I knew it. There was that one time when I said I didn't deserve you , do you remember that? I said I was afraid that you really didn't care about meand you were just friends with me to be nice. You then said that every moment with me was worth it and you leaned over and kissed me and I knew that I would never love a person more than I loved you as long as ran through my veins. But all of that changed, do you remember what I said to make you so mad? So mad as to walk out on me? I don't remember and I'm glad I don't because I don't ever want to repeat it. You see the sorrow and Pain in my eyes and you begin to cry. You had your doubts, who wouldnt? But the moment you looked into my eyes, you finally realized that nobody feels the same way about you but me. You saved me, made me a better person, the person I truly am. You say you're sorry, too and I begin to cry as well. Crying, we embrace and as we do, the sky turns blue, the lights turn back on and life returns to our faces. The roads we walk stray and become difficult to traverse. We will fight, we will quarrel together, but you know and I know that we are srtonger than that. Do you know why?
